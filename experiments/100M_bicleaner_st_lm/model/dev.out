Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
the meeting also aims to resolve the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of consent in the peace process .
the deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans in front of the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial talk , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election with reference to the election im@@ min@@ ent in Israel .
in an emergency call professor is standing up to have his girlfriend shot
in an emergency call Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told with a slightly z@@ itt@@ led voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house , the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; I feel sorry , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb , who taught at two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds where , according to the police , he shot and killed a popular professor of history , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff had heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said Lamb had made the fatal emergency call after it .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took his life when the police ch@@ ained him .
a day after firing in the university , the students and lec@@ turers were forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or a criminal background .
Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time , there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that Lamb had worked so hard for him would represent no guarantee for an automatic path to employment as Assistant Professor .
University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s trail when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ ona Meth@@ el Johnson .
his car ran in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with approximately 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he graduated in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar game .
at that time he was the g@@ ull of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and living in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss apparently were together for some time .
in the emergency call Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of marriage .
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was ok .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played the blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail performed both on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played one or the other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit night near Gau@@ tier , said that he was Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time , after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience ended .
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were in the clearing and j@@ oked each other .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including teachers , staff , students and members of the community at a candle light memorial service .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts Ms. Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vi@@ gi@@ l , while the university choir &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lesson will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story was corrected to reflect that the police now say that Lamb opened the emergency after he shot down Schmidt , and that in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss called Pr@@ enti@@ ss his wife , but there is no indication that they have ever married .

Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the Ro@@ y@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ awn and an arm length of being with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever made . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - US , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he depl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Change figures showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks with surveys to the bottom , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ in@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time , in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys led his leadership to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of which won only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ um@@ ps stamina and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow it .
here are some current survey figures indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Pop@@ ular values have turned 180 degrees .
just before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University revealed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say that they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in the early states .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa stated last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two @-@ thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they would either be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump would be nominated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upset &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) .
the next thing about enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of Irish voters on the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right tem@@ per for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the nation &apos;s first pres@@ election state , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the republi@@ can think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they expose their war@@ y hat@@ s , Republi@@ can voters are holding Tr@@ ump for real .
when asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey by CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this point in the last cycle , four out of ten Republi@@ cans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it is evident that a variety of GO@@ P voters consider Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans gathered around another candidate Tr@@ ump still beats almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps management while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University at the beginning of September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has scored 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points ahead of Walker 15 points ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters who support Tr@@ ump say that they have firmly assigned their votes .
of course much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said they leave the door open to change to other candidates .
nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say that they have formed their mind are twice as common to Tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
since Donald Tr@@ ump stated in his election campaign two months ago emig@@ rants from Mexico to &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration was a pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse on 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump @-@ decisive His@@ pan@@ o @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post @-@ survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they coinci@@ de with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump will apparently do it .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son have lost half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days survey of ABC / Post , they would rather want a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are mad at Washington as well .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of the four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans have been frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 per cent . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : Germany &apos;s five most exclusive residential districts
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea att .
in the street , a square meter of a roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the study , therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bus in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate Profession@@ als Engel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residen@@ ces - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euro - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is here , as an exception , not at the top .
Champions League : dream start of Bavaria thanks to Müller and Götz@@ e
twin Tor@@ cont@@ e in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have given the FC Bayern a dream start to the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the Wit@@ ch@@ urn of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers &apos;s double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ ie Hit ( 89 . ) earned at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start success in series is supposed to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy where Guardi@@ ola will finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received his 28th consecutive hits in the Champions League for the Bavarian leadership of Olympic @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who left a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m had promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the game at the Kar@@ ay@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium - and the Munich ranked word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home games in the top class , including renowned clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but Bavaria , un@@ defeated in seven Euro @-@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were often initiated by a shift in the game to the left @-@ hand side Douglas Costa , who rarely passed through the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k from the right half @-@ field struck in the left upper corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
the best opportunities in half had been Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker Ide@@ ye Brown beat the head ball of the Pole by the line ( 26 ) .
then by direct , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto with his knees par@@ ked ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians ble@@ w up their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could make con@@ i@@ fers .
but at Tor@@ ski@@ er Manuel Neu@@ er was om@@ is@@ sion .
so , for example , when he held a shot of ide@@ als over the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola made a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center near Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good .
Mario Götz@@ e , back in the cad@@ re after muscular problems , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero has given the green light only after the final session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , that &apos;s very vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ 2 ) .
id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , Müller still placed one on top .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ v@@ alle in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partially ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bayern @-@ fans apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich followers with pun@@ ches .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , thus har@@ ms not only the lungs but also the teeth - this suggests a long @-@ term Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : with aband@@ on@@ ment , the risk sin@@ ks quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
in smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers have the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to exceed 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher .
the scientists observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ val tissue , emphas@@ ises the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ val infections in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could last more than ten years before the endanger@@ ing came back to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained author Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , study manager H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and also leads to good dental health until old age according to our findings .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population in the age of 65 to 74 years of tooth@@ lessness have been affected by the DI@@ f@@ E .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ pins the findings .
arch@@ e@@ ologists encounter remains from the late anti@@ quity at the c@@ law of Cologne
archaeological finds were made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the last time .
in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have dug up skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a department of archae@@ ology .
in the third part of the Rhine @-@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found it .
from text documents it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , explained Trier .
besides rem@@ n@@ ants of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman caught by freight train
after a young woman is caught up at the railway station in Gei@@ lenk@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern , the federal police asks the people for help .

EU Commission proposes new court in conflict over TT@@ IP
in order to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
accordingly , the cont@@ ested private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning matches considerably more traditional dishes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström before the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de intends to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is intended to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate specifically that the EU states and the US will jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
this is for the first time also a second instance .
it would allow to obj@@ ection to judgement .
up to now , the parties involved agreed with each other to arbit@@ rators , there was no obj@@ ection to their judgments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the discussion of the past months it has become clear that citizens do not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , it intends to work towards an International Investment Court according to its own specifications .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , driven mainly by large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice for which companies impose compensation on tax@@ pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws , or cut down consumer and environmental standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organisations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , however , described the plans as a major advance .
the Commission took into account essential points in the reform that Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked out with other EU trade ministers in the spring .
the old system of arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the legal action of the economy by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium @-@ sized enterprises might be dis@@ advant@@ aged by this .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP free trade agreement ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been ongoing since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the issue of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , which the in@@ timi@@ dated Fol@@ ks@@ änger has recorded the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us about various places he repeatedly records on the map , about his meticul@@ ous and lovingly arranged songs .
where they came into being and what it looks like there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderful creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; intelli@@ gently composed songs seem to be very close to American folk of the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ent styles at any time .
the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first install@@ ment of a bold series : each of the 50 US states should follow .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but already in 2004 and in the proximity of the Rhine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has already appeared and breaks down positively certain expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is being reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
in 2005 , &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ leg@@ oise &quot; ) was launched in 2005 .
bri@@ mming with ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and was missing in any records of the influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ ore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic articles of sale . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth decent studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried out by programmed sequences or beats and plays with any effect and rever@@ b .
long ago the smaller clubs came up , the stage shows are a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage decoration .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five member band .
in the dark @-@ kept Hamburg city more !
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is mainly presenting the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the distinc@@ tly stri@@ pped St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the audience list@@ ens : the lecture is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; throw away &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; plate in essence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens mainly thanks to an en@@ core , plays a few older songs and finally dec@@ lines under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ c@@ unda
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut will be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited in the Prime Minister &apos;s round of cargo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n will give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s frame and set himself for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to make the first of his six pre @-@ established questions shortly after mid@@ day , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip several sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary sc@@ rut@@ iny of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday .
meanwhile the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them at a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has provoked a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several front pages stories in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; been in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news overnight program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported it as a leader .
the BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also st@@ acking within Labour &quot; and Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s comments on the position of the European Union and the limitation in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes pres@@ ume to remove the whole idea of a limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pension minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to lower the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23,@@ ,000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he has been a T@@ ory boss over the patch box in parliament over the last decade .
the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy approach , states that he has received &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s frames are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subjected to both &quot; pun@@ ish@@ ability &quot; and stri@@ fe with bar@@ b@@ arians and has instead concentrated on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality , and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela eagle , the Shadow Economic Minister , will represent him if he does not take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also made the idea that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; punch and punch &quot; theatre , often associated with the questions of the Prime Minister . but a few years later he admitted that he failed .
since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the panel of ministers was regarded as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling and its leadership in the lower house and its position among its parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound increases by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the pound rose by le@@ aps and bo@@ unds after data showing an increase in the UK wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was boo@@ sted by the goal of the bid for SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , the result without Bon@@ uses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year .
this percentage was the fastest in 2009 and generated assessments of the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound climbed by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro at € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index grew by 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover bid of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry stocks were , after encouraging news from the competi@@ tor group for lux@@ uries , Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose 5 % after the mining industry said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a share sale as part of its debt reduction strategy .
the shares in the Mon@@ di packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a 4.3 % decrease after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s placed his assessment of the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the boss of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages would end@@ anger expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs .

Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os first .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Leban@@ ese to the idea of a potato d@@ öner idea
potatoes or D@@ öner ?
both are possible - namely in the potato gro@@ wer , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ iss owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the phrase &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y Pot@@ ato and meat stuck together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer , which is stock@@ ed with meat and potatoes , turns into its store .
&quot; this is multic@@ ultur@@ alism for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
the Leban@@ ese had the idea to register in the patent office in Munich meanwhile .
it has recently been protected by the authority as utility model .
how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y does not want to betra@@ y it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding also goes well with its customers .
Met@@ aboli@@ sm begins campaign to campaign against Al@@ di@@ - In@@ fall
Met@@ alli@@ c is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a soil composition campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 stores in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as Eis@@ makers S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store owners who sell dis@@ counted tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler of food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual Invest@@ ors &apos; Day Strate@@ gic Day .
there is a lot in the game since South Australia and Western Australia form nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shop shops and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states .
buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to some 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that , after opening its first markets , Al@@ di will take away some five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail@@ er could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars before interest and tax , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath stated .
at the same time Met@@ cash gains market shares in eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found out that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will fall in the food and food business by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business lunch in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear .
Met@@ cash refused to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ alli@@ s has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade outlets , which have about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous printing on sales and margins .
the wholes@@ aler however def@@ ends and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to equal selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products every week and to improve their stores by growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and shop renovation programs will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deserves praise as criticism for his own behaviour according to the President of the Australian Tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious debate with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka .
in a fi@@ ery qualification play in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat the Kyr@@ gios , and I should sm@@ ite the child . &quot;
as he was finally seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a cra@@ mp served a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I am quite en@@ vious about is the fact that after my view Th@@ an@@ asi has been drawn into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he broke a ra@@ cket when he lost a ra@@ cket in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a bit too rigor@@ ously .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gios in the important preliminary decision which begins on Friday , and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; at first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said .
and I think that Nick was very quick to get up on what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to give him the consequences of his actions , and it is best for the crew and it is best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the state of emergency and sealed the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and adher@@ ed to all who tried to get into the country illeg@@ ally . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos ensu@@ ed at the border , when hundreds of migrants were gathered in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land , and Serbian officials responded with ou@@ trage .
the people who fled from violence hid for an unknown time in a strip of land at the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but fru@@ stration continued .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter flo@@ ated over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian call police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants from Hungary will be returned , while more and more arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ nation block at a disputed meeting in Brussels no common immigration policy could be agreed .
the ministers , however , agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on an im@@ min@@ ent action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency state launched on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to tackle the crisis so that they could block the streets and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News Cor@@ respon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison ins@@ ets were used in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states including Germany .
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary do the crossing of the border or damaging the 4 @-@ metre ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency status , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the use of the military , expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have seen armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people tried to cross the border , fifteen others had already penet@@ rated further into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of off@@ ences to the new laws .
authorities are attempting to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials concluded two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a railway carriage with bar@@ bed wire arrived to close the borders .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing close to Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and squee@@ ze a crowd to push themselves there .
about 20 succeeded , but thousands stayed outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advance ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit jump in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent previously ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) .
vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who hasn &apos;t announced yet whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the start of the prim@@ aries , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their minds are deciding which candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than those of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some profits .
Clinton has a huge advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased .
their support with the men has declined mark@@ edly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters under the age of 50 has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
but Clinton has a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advance in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries throughout the country say that they would support Clinton , if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprisingly , that Clinton &apos;s current supporters were particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is President ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection to Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreement on dealing with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also quoted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Vice President raises potential for the presidential office in the balance , 57 percent of the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it .
if democratic elec@@ tors of prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clinton &apos;s followers say that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the democr@@ ats nom@@ ination , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is raised against S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic elec@@ tors see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , in the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call questions on the elec@@ torate .
similarly , as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries will be considered unacceptable .
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates produce good results in some important features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party .
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
with the three candidates , Bi@@ den best deals with hon@@ esty while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have any opinions about him .
the democratic elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic elec@@ tors have no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server are still being provided as Secretary of State during office hours , most Democ@@ rat voters are satisfied with their explanation of the affair and say that it has not influenced their opinion overall .
but it is another story in the American public as a whole .
half of the Americans are now un@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one third is satisfied .
public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had wor@@ sen@@ ed them .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse from Clinton .
although Clinton is viewed as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 per cent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not regard them as an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote nationwide also see Tr@@ ump as not honest and not trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good marks on leadership .
among the six candidates we tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut in hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders to be honest , but as with Car@@ son many have no opinion of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump on country @-@ wide pol@@ l
Ben Car@@ son is in the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l dropped to the two candidates , and others lose even more dramatically
Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers throughout the country . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted before Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son fell from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son arrives very well with demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the lowest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former governor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida @-@ Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son climb@@ s in surveys - with 19 % support among Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump Well before Car@@ son .
looking at a car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump took some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son decided to question Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign appearance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently warm up to 29 degrees .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers in order to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people are no longer going to the sea : the water in the North and Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares with it .
in contrast , bath temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during a deport@@ ation ritual in a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five people .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood gra@@ b@@ bed Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduc@@ tory ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , informed the police .
officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound ru@@ cksack full of sand with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained about head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less , allegedly waiting an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police .
but they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to take advice , &quot; Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point the members began to hide utensils and basically set the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ gra@@ ef Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly added with bl@@ unt power injuries to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families have been destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies at the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended a charge because of murder of the third degree for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of har@@ ass@@ ous attacks and the formation of a criminal association .
&quot; we not only want to be responsible for the people involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - sanc@@ tioned this , we will also be held accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch &apos;s College banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest rates , and the house se will be shaking , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
in particular , the history of the economy offers little guidance to the process .
a recession came within only 11 months from the first rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
for this reason , representatives of the US central bank have so v@@ ehem@@ ently emphas@@ ised that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a higher interest rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first increase of the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to guide the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a look at a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy might react :
as the market saw last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what is going on after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in more detail , in the past 35 years the market is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the interest rate rise , rather flat in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to appear later in the raising cycle and the return on equi@@ val@@ ents commen@@ ces to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that had not existed before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is extremely not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product near its lowest point will be at a rate increase of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , in the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP had fallen below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to data from Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop might be ris@@ ky and raises the question , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants rose to a net interest rate of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading only gives a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and before rec@@ essions have been put in the shadows very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months .
fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticipated a higher rate of interest , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than stocks when they change their strategic direction .
at bonds yields appear to change direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the raising cycle , the bond @-@ endi@@ ces immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to closer ties between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often result in better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher income , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed @-@ strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; besides the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , credit tigh@@ tening has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and large corporations , companies that develop the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit when interest rates rise and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse since an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also financing their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial rate increase , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded an average of 5 percentage points on average after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares sur@@ passed their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest will most lose , Gold@@ man said .
consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar outside the pure stock games .
savers can see gains from higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are , how fast that will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament &apos;s colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins took the show The Voice and said that it was not very original .
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , claims a leading Euro MP and increases new pressure on the station to prove that he does something the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said .
he also referred to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be the Br@@ its just under a different name .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously named examples in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham .
BBC Director General rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competitors when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I &apos;m learning from Radio 3 , I &apos;ll never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that hard work must be made to engage the audience as it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport was under fire to kick off commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in special BBC mode .
he added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our own cow@@ shed , &quot; when the next time there was an entertainment series .
however , he refused to exp@@ el the order of further series of The Voice in the future or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales in August at the slow@@ est and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there was seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the recording started in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November has slow@@ ed down spending
for more than a decade , virtual shopping has bo@@ omed , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only 5 percent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for previous years and go back to 2000 , this has developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the Guardian &apos;s IM@@ R@@ G sales index .
he explained that online sales intensified three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do so in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is comm@@ uting and we will probably experience that the growth will be less@@ ened .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the dimin@@ ishing returns .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers with@@ hold their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers are fighting for bar@@ gains , buyers can stop making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that out of £ 5 spending a little more than £ 1 was spent online .
in some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than one quarter of people bu@@ ys clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried through the streets by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca
Saudi Arabia partially off@@ sets the collapse of the huge Saudi Ben Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed .
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury them that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mour@@ ning filled , largely dressed in white , the track to pay their respect when the first of the dead entered their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the proc@@ ession proc@@ eeded in the holy place , where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the beg@@ ging .
the bodies were released for bur@@ ial when the Saudi king hung a sanc@@ tion on the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster that left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dam@@ pers who were killed when a crane rus@@ hed through the big central mos@@ que Mek@@ ka were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane collap@@ sed .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual h@@ addle in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ an will continue to Mec@@ ca with thousands still coming to the city .
today king Sal@@ man said the Bin Laden Group would not have stopped the crane &apos;s arm when he was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden Group is responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s tour abroad was prohibited .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man v@@ owed to reveal what caused the fall of the crane rus@@ hing into a large mos@@ que courtyard , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ ess , who later took place this month .
the Bin Laden Group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mek@@ ka &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive construction project managed by Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been connected to the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the collapse of the crane came amid heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is required at least once in the life of each healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ruled that 1 million ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same sum of permanent injured .
other injuries will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ more and more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has risen
this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops are opened for professional tra@@ des@@ people .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets throughout the country
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the deployment of skilled Eastern European craftsmen who carry out work in their homes
if you can deal skill@@ fully with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , nowadays you seem to belong to a minority .
the British are increasingly occup@@ ying arti@@ sans to carry out DIY jobs in their homes , the head of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now over@@ hau@@ led .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 points of sale of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions in the store are met by women .
at the moment the men prevail .
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that perform more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It is still working a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we need to shift this more strongly towards a balance .
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of the top companies listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured its top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that occupies exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group ow@@ es the cost of closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open up to 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two officials from the Austrian volleyball team A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dispens@@ ation on Wednesday at the K@@ lagen@@ furt national court .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
he has been acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process has been postpon@@ ed .
according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ end@@ ant had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that in the years 2006 to 2011 the def@@ end@@ ants used funds from accounts of the association , which they could disp@@ ose of in their functions , for private purposes .
he covers the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also charged with financial problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this fact was the chair of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sho@@ v@@ eller &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the defence argued that at no time an asset was incurred by the association .
the sports officials were only charged with expense allowance and the sports club , for which they had spent a lot of time and money in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va had around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings ( about 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) in 2001 .
&quot; at that time , we stood in front of the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? , &quot; said one of the def@@ end@@ ants , in the bread@@ crum@@ bs of the finance office .
with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant , he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , put our life insurance as security at the Bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been agreed with the association : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debts .
in addition , with the corresponding financial success , the payout of expense allowance was decre@@ ed retro@@ spec@@ tively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when an asset had been on the account .
therefore , flat and not detailed bookings also appeared , explained the former chairman of the proceedings .
the accounts and accounts shared the two def@@ end@@ ants , the second def@@ end@@ ant said .
the judge asked why the payments were not disclosed in detail to the association .
the association has not been interested in the details of the financial bet@@ ter@@ ment , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer .
when investigations started in 2011 against the one function@@ ary , an amount of € 120@@ ,000 was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants explained .
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor turned into the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer has been formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why damage ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor .
the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association never suffered any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he just calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
he added 1,000 euros per month to di@@ ets , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants could not provide exact documents for the early years .
these were not stored anymore after a check in which everything was judged to be correct , they said .
the second def@@ end@@ ant was also charged with mil@@ eage .
all the exercises will be made in cash , and he explained in his statement about his hab@@ itation of international market to the Bank to Blei@@ burg .
the trial will continue on 23 September with the ques@@ tioning of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents more 30,000 jobs
in addition to staff reductions , which have been ongoing for three years , the Compu@@ Stra@@ it will be building further jobs in the division of the company .
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ te Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group is planning the disman@@ tling of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment .
as a result , costs are to be saved in the amount of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) , the company informed them on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share published 2.3 percent on the stock market .
the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto Group currently spl@@ its itself into a new society - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business segments are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC section and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under US $ 25.@@ 4 billion .
the proceeds were thus returned in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company , headed by Me@@ g Whit@@ man , has only late re@@ acted to customers buying smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and getting more and more business online .
in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans fores@@ ee the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 positions .
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat actions in Iraq , however , would predominantly come to rejection : 54 percent said against it , 35 percent were cons@@ enting .
the fact that other states fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict .
a co @-@ operation with Syrian authorities Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad declined 51 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed , 20 percent would be responsible for it .
29 per cent did not decide .

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence break at Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian Police has deployed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ laun@@ chers .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the point of border control .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind the police a police line was formed and a water ej@@ ector was standing behind the polic@@ eman .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially inhal@@ ed pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now with@@ drew somewhat cau@@ ti@@ ously .
a pregnant and apparently injured wife was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from breathing difficulties .
the press spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries due to the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves if the US staff is coming together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for the first time for almost a decade or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists surv@@ ey@@ ed by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist a little longer and will keep interest rates at this current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event , because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero zone and start a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ tender , senior staff at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less rocky outlook on global circumstances .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs point out that the chances of such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 20.00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death thro@@ es at Delta State University leaving excuse for ap@@ ologi@@ ze
after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleague later on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot on someone , and someone has killed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that the police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not give it .
Lamb didn &apos;t give any explanation for his shots .
as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I am so sorry I wanted , I could reverse it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb sailed 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him .
University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
despite reports on Monday , the Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married for about seven years as a &quot; good person . &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter 19 and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he didn &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen picked him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville on that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his life lau on the university website ad@@ mits .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year with a better organisation alone .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the workplace .
there are new negotiations with the pilot union .
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates the low @-@ cost Eu@@ row@@ ings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million a year from cost and redemption syn@@ ergy , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the Executive Board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Eu@@ row@@ ings should be developed as independently as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the executive team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
up to now , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employees has been complex .
the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict of collective bar@@ gaining with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations are to be resum@@ ed after the distinc@@ tly stopped strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a predicted record result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to come to viable results as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to several strikes in recent months .
in addition to the interim supply of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; concept .
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa stores routes to the company &apos;s own bil@@ l@@ board Eu@@ row@@ ings .

Manchester United can &apos;t play Luke Sha@@ w for months because of double frac@@ tures
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven in the Champions League defeat of Manchester .
while this led to the left outside def@@ enders to cry and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give up the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w turned into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before he was taken to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double foot frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or maybe a day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ ick .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card are due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a twe@@ et to Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly again . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V defeat
the United Kingdom advoc@@ ate has an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June with the European Championship in France .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a player leaves the place with this type of injury , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a frac@@ ture when Mexico played against Van Go@@ als Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Coc@@ u said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked as if it had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke .
in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno told me : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be .
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it &apos;s one thing that all parents soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided to call Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s environmental f@@ abel published in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; fun , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to always be a picture or message that we &apos;ve missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead returns a content of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ose @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was listening and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this were not yet suspi@@ cious : Cameron &apos;s text , presented by Cameron in part , reads like a summary of the Lor@@ ax movie presented on the Internet Movie Database website , and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ose @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems impro@@ b@@ able that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here an un@@ named boy hears the need of stri@@ pping once @-@ ler despite the protests of the name Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , fi@@ dd@@ ly creature , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a row .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral agency .
Super@@ camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but no further direct comments were given .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
pushing for Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive outlook .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown great@@ ness on test level , is an option for the attack .
related news : Adam Ly@@ th exp@@ els from the UK test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to release Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
in his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that the cri@@ cket players are aimed at results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , one would have length@@ ened the run of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man .
the question of how much time a test hit man gets to put his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play back and forth .
the only accus@@ ation you can raise was that England first started Jonathan Des@@ p@@ ite the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top shape - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in and he &apos;s a drummer I set high .
he &apos;s an X factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge place , which hit us very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this naturally depends on the position of the team in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to suggest Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and receive four Qui@@ cks , di@@ ved , and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this lef@@ ty has already shown that he is a cri@@ cket player of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een perhaps did not get his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference .
my previous team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before coming up as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred R@@ uns straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the coaching staff .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ a , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game who will have a wealth of experience since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the dressing room even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made easy in heart .

&quot; &quot; &quot; my European friend who wants a UK @-@ looking UK inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not be alone with France , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave office before it looks bad for her , as has happened with the exc@@ essively long exp@@ ul@@ sions such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading power .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg in order to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may deliberately not plan helpful comments , all in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 @-@ inspired referendum in 1975 , which supported our entry 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they can recall poor@@ ly with Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name for themselves as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU straight ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telep@@ hon@@ y ali@@ ens and the pseu@@ do non @-@ In@@ länder , who own most of our large newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her but realized that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of going to his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he resist@@ ed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had rejected the principle of the un@@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 who thus opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly t@@ aps on my back on Monday - I told him that he had no time wa@@ sting for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 80 @-@ s , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it in a friendly way - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ ps &apos;s traditional anti @-@ dy@@ e tendency and the wild ones of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary called &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week , when the sc@@ out in him fought not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father worked on television to be il@@ lo@@ y@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; stay under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ i &apos;s term - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their conference on Monday evening .
whatever the original bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock , and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ity to EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite Siege economy - their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left @-@ wing dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato , Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims from a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking began from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ he published the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Basic report &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the proposition of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to lead their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received from British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references from BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting explained to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding it should have received according to reports previously received by tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International .
the reasons for the selection of the members of the committee are not supplied , but this includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco management of P@@ he took part .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people per year die of a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
through the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ er@@ ers , says former CEO of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ poin@@ ter and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcasting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for public @-@ law programs likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard @-@ disputed time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters such as BB@@ C4 .
after BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said he had tried six years in Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs exist or send programs that are clearly shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus communication committee in his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I think is not a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put its production on programs that others do not make or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first class time window because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s of course non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could be financed even without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ er@@ don@@ is another one , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I &apos;m tired of seeing how this is supposed to be public @-@ law television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said the BBC was to blame for reviews because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the most popular programmes of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh suggested in 2003 that the BBC shows how to sell shows .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue when they &apos;re based on their hypo@@ critical missions for the justification of $ 4 billion radio charges , &quot; Well , of course , we &apos;ve created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee on the broadcasting fee : &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this .
of course you all think , we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who are a lot of money for £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much from the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to review their ethics mission , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only a few of the BBC &apos;s production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % in radio - and they should take an example of the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , clarify and enter@@ tain . &quot;
on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , from which he said that only a handful will be shown on television , and with the commercial Sen@@ ders will enter alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetic &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by break@@ out of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the impulses work through activating mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells genetically altered to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetic , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that one day the procedure could replace deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread@@ worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the reinforced ultrasound waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves trigger the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applied ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetic , a ground breaking tool that enables scientists to switch neur@@ on on and off with stimul@@ i of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetic might have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light which has to be sent down to the desired location in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatment , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that can be seen at bus stations and metro trains and which require a second look .

the 300 posters are by artists who exhibited their work in the Museum of cruel Designs in Bank@@ sys D@@ ism@@ an@@ aland .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped distribution in London and took advantage of &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a £ 6 pack of Allen keys , claimed to have &quot; access to around one third of the bus stops on the planet . &quot;

many artists work with activists in protest movements to work and notice that they have to go outside into the real world , so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters is greeting the commu@@ ter commu@@ ter in the subway .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP which works as a non @-@ profit association with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ eover artist , who also works for free .
V@@ C@@ CP Creative Director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the weapons trade fair - by a du@@ el of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tender business advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through the blu@@ ing with bright colors and animation it remains to be stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we need now is to interfere with the British government and guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally on our door@@ step .
perhaps the most creative kind of art around the weapons trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors c@@ row fantastic eu@@ ph@@ em@@ istic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I moved into a student residence as a self @-@ for@@ getting 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anger@@ ed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I have learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces is from easy nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
it is temp@@ ting to cry out : people tell where you come from , if and where you have taken sab@@ bat@@ ons , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &apos;re not loving nor hate because in serious guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like , unlike those with whom you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your lashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let people .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into beverage recept@@ ors , movie night venues and municipal meeting places , but they are also the places where people dress and under@@ wear their under@@ wear .
related to this : don &apos;t forget to start a relationship at the university
intro@@ vert is a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee @-@ culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a milit@@ ant of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him a sm@@ s instead of kno@@ cking .
by the way : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
make friends through baking .
as you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I &apos;ve baked something to you . so , and now please smile if I ask you a few personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to talk and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed l@@ ump of flour , sugar and fat result in people falling asleep when kno@@ cking .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of sp@@ le@@ en for your tea also ?
check that with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even when they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to handle more balanced than my room@@ mate who added a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , which stops people from sleep or work .
it is not just about being a decent person , but rather that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb .
a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbours if it was a thing for them to make drum &amp; bass a bit qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , closed her door and went on to her three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would come into the same residence at random ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be ground@@ less embarrass@@ ing if you hold a fellow @-@ mate for your future spouse , take care of them , get rid of them and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they cross together all common friends ?
of course , the heart gets its own way - but if a hot co @-@ inhabit@@ ant is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing is more fin@@ er than it seems .
a good trick is fun , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
give by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson about security - but never th@@ aw anyone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then place in the freezer - but do not tor@@ till@@ ate their possessions on the blanket no more than twice .
town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ educ@@ ators , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner relies on town@@ houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single @-@ educ@@ ating mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ners . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build good and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gu@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass placing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part of this .
in view of the refugee flow , we also need ample living space in the coming decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey semi @-@ detached house is the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a terra@@ ced house needs the f@@ ew@@ est place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of flats .
each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units , each with four asylum seek@@ ers .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legally I have dra@@ gged my project correctly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ min@@ ent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the pitch regulation .
great cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who manages three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what definitely is not right .
but don &apos;t you shar@@ pen your competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ bert : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we have built luxury apartments that hardly can afford any more .
my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the single mother or the little ear@@ ners .
I &apos;ll show you how to build and build good at the present time .
that &apos;s why it &apos;s all about .

in the fight for the championship title in Formula 1 , N@@ ico Ros@@ berg only knows a motto : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Championship runner @-@ up pointed out ahead of the start into the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will influence the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which pres@@ ided over Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot get the membership fee .
youth work and talent search should also be promoted .

district office looks for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ markt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined together under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg Square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations you can also attend courses there .
the social foundation runs it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , senior citizens and advice @-@ seek@@ ers will receive information on questions such as care insurance or services provided by the health care and nursing staff .
for years we have established with our ambul@@ ant care service that nursing members are often left alone .
there are infinitely many questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , not in@@ frequently many services of the insur@@ ers are not used because the complexity of insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord , J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the citizens &quot; hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ o@@ therapeutic treatment can be used .
the offers from the retirement center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ u@@ dis is responsible for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the senior centre for care and care &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explained Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both executives see the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this requires a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
furthermore , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the compatibility in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot;
by doing so , the social fund is making a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 16 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m .

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang 92 @-@ old dec@@ eased
Karl M@@ ang , one of the do@@ yen of Viennese architecture , is dead .
he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus was informed on Tuesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus would lose an honorary member and at the same time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as it was said in the broadcast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War .
since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute manager .
from 1972 to 1983 he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design .
in the 1980s , he was commissioned with the establishment of the Treas@@ ury in the Hof@@ burg of Vienna and the reconstruction of the Palais Lob@@ ko@@ witz in the Austrian Theatre Museum .

witnesses seek the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the grounds of the gas station .
one of these men then cried out to the young people and struck it with their fist .
the victim suffered from a nose @-@ leg@@ ged and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he left his victim at first .
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and demonstr@@ atively drove over there several times .
when the vehicle was not seen any more , the last one went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male member .
with the help of a stick @-@ stick , you stick to the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over practice rock breaks and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen .
there are also mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , business promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert .
in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are missing luck : there Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice rock breaks on October 1st .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing by half a place in the coming months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he has invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic at first sight when the Fel@@ sen@@ ic met years ago Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ lov@@ l , who is currently completing her specialist training at the Dresden Hospital and who also wants to enter into practice this year .
&quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen and laughs .
&quot; when it was done , I just ph@@ oned them . &quot;
Mr. Müller liked the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the clos@@ eness and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees to be his own boss .
and so they agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
there the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed as a leading emergency doctor in Di@@ ep@@ holz County and is involved in voluntary work in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness , Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
starting September 19th the practice for the new boss is being prepared .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ sen@@ hausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ tin ) specializes in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the mill@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as home doctors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
the ED@@ V is also completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of a total of 50,000 Euros will be donated by the mill@@ er as part of a funding program from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Saturday mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come to the field of rock breaks each quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
there is another doctor &apos;s office in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too .
if you visit Müll@@ ers &apos; consultation hours , by the way , looks also above all in familiar faces : takes care of the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the rock faces .
with their f@@ arewell to A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the medical professionals have practiced there for 30 years .
&quot; at the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; rec@@ alls Ur@@ sel Fel@@ est@@ ausen rich@@ ly .
she felt a little melanch@@ oly after the long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients very often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband laugh@@ ingly compl@@ ements : &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I have always pressed against gardening , now it could become different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we let the refugees go through &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Home Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to submit a request for asylum is also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; natural &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of people are in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; clearly , however , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; corridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refused &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would allow arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and may also set up cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
this is what the Minister of the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see in Lai@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia is , however , already heavily controlled as the outer limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , however , Slovenian wants to limit its borders to refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fill his commitments , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night @-@ hours on Tuesday to leave the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia in order to avoid the registration .
the c@@ roati@@ an police could pick them up in the nearby ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , since then , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik eng@@ ages police vehicles with new refugees .
it mainly deals with Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are also already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with about 4000 refugees , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo ended on the Croatian border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , re@@ directed towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to make people wise to include certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , in the course of the day further buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were travelling all night from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , some 500 kilometres away from Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
in fact , the postpon@@ ement of the former Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a somewhat further west @-@ located stretch .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not mention details , but he pointed out that Croatia , as a non @-@ Schengen member , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , and since then , the EU partners have consistently received a good record of what concerns the standard of border controls .
on the Serbian side there are still about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain closed completely .
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will continue to travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian interior minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early with a local head@@ light in Hor@@ gos : he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
it would not be a very high number of refugees at this time .
one could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrant - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugee workers have already begun to distribute maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are drawn up by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatia War still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went into the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;

for this reason , this public effective promotion to the 20 @-@ year @-@ old is good .

F@@ ed@@ Ex Res@@ ult Mi@@ xed , Finance outlook for 2016 lowered
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered his view of profits for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ sourcing business .
the company also said that it plans to hire approximately 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holidays .
at this point in the past year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50.000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share accounted for more than 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. concluded a gain between 10.@@ 40 $ and € 10.@@ 90 in the financial year ending in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous predic@@ tion .
according to a survey conducted by Fac@@ t@@ Set , analysts expected $ 10.@@ 84 .
the lower prospect will be at an average of 4.@@ 9 percent in spite of the price increases , which will take effect on the 4th of January and despite higher charges for bo@@ d@@ transports of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online retail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yields solid income when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vacation rentals were announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional man@@ power , such as the same number as last year .
in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex used 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share forecast analysts predicted by Z@@ ack Investment Research analysts .
sales increased 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks inter@@ viewed analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipments which brought sales to stagn@@ ate in its unit express shipment .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in bo@@ d@@ sourcing rose by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self insurance .
the Express Unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the freight business .
in the retail trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gies spend two days this week sitting around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it &apos;s time to raise the lead for the first time for almost a decade .
there is a mur@@ al of the United States above them at one end of the decorated , two @-@ story session room .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed leader Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing the US occupation and prices keep stable here .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be re@@ conc@@ iled by the un@@ parall@@ eled stimulus from the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows soli@@ dly , the recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal loans - and be it only by a quarter percentage point .
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing to watch , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said .
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which in itself insur@@ es the financial market .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have forecast a rate of interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts reduce the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ sky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it does , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her declaration to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that interest rates would calm the financial markets because they would eliminate uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on track to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in spite of the complaints from liber@@ als she expected that more economic progress would be necessary to raise the sentence .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate dropped to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level fores@@ een by F@@ ed as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can handle higher interest rates and need them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets all over the world kn@@ itted together at the end of last month , after China de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial average value fell by more than 16 % in May , while investors were afraid that slow@@ ing down the Chinese economy would reduce global growth .
the market has recovered a little this month , with the D@@ ow now almost 10 % below the level of May .
the market turbul@@ ences for the F@@ ed representatives influence the complex calculations when the interest is to be increased .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA C@@ innamon Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included technically in its decision @-@ making . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous in recent years .
the mere note of the former conductor Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , triggered confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them not only to monitor developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Sha@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , stated this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements , which apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
Lack@@ ner , authorised member of the Federal Open Market Committee , devoted to interest rate increase , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia led the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited perc@@ ei@@ vable effects on growth in the US &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Lack@@ ner said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market collapse , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Sav@@ ings of the Bank of England .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a higher interest rate because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe that it should rush ahead of time .

try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / bearing was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small life aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
making a warm welcome is not possible without the commitment of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also at Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
even with their 74 learning difficulties , she still teaches .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
there she helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , there is no other teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ at@@ ric company Rio Grande encourages healthy breast@@ feeding nutrition
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS is trying to educ@@ ate women about how important good nutrition during the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck breasts which are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy food .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that higher calorie intake is not the only dietary adju@@ v@@ ant to make mothers perform .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects women &apos;s genes and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , un@@ healthy nutrition of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ese sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the application for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ desired rotation of the gymn@@ asi@@ um on the Bern@@ stein@@ horn sport grounds is taking step by step : in the latest municipal council session the elabor@@ ated proposal was unanim@@ ously approved without extensive discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to that , the committee decided , among other things , to apply for an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was the permission for a special form with regard to the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ con@@ current first and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be established . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems is the background of the planning : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it was about the tendency to ascend , which for energy reasons - different from the development plan - should be under ten degrees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan permitted no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the tendency of the roof - although the municipal council is generally more restric@@ tive in the case of deliver@@ ance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the gymn@@ asi@@ um construction is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros are calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from the promotion of school and mass sports .
in the next step , the construction application for the 18 x 36 meter hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt für examination .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au hospital .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is reflected in the start@@ ling plans of the Land@@ kreis hospital , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision on this matter will meet the Supervisory Board , and this will take effect on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg .
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au are to be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has resulted in the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
the question of who should succeed was according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October and switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this in every case means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized on the In@@ ner Station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
for the next two years , Fischer will be working with his team , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned this for 2018 , when the current refur@@ bish@@ ment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chair@@ woman of the Supervisory Board , was confronted by rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal police , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a day psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real perspective for the house where fishermen have been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years have not given it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ sen@@ berg ( formerly 100 beds ) was again and again threatened by closure in recent decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the hand legs of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are demanded today ( 20.@@ 15 p.m. ) with the Berg@@ ischen HC .
although the championship leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for the arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , the bad@@ ener at Bh@@ c did a painful defeat and got something good there .
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been severely injured during their ma@@ ize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a ma@@ ize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in use , as the police announced .
after a firing squ@@ ad , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could come to the accident was unclear at first .
the det@@ ective police established .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their bodies thrown into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , has fallen victim to a violent crime .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including the public prosec@@ utor and the police on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was also arrested on Tuesday evening , is regarded as an active suspect , who has indeed conf@@ essed his statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ se .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported on Sunday morning after having come home on the evening after visiting a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen not as agreed .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first met his victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .
with interviews in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing people , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , police inter@@ ro@@ gated the authorities to kill the 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the body in the channel .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a heavy blow to him .
the further investigation will be made on the near@@ er circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution battles in the German housing market have long since begun .
with the arriving refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many large cities .
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units have to be built every year by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
this means that 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in their first accommodation after the first three months of their stay .
many then hit the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers stayed for rent last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policies of recent years .
Germany is shooting down a deficit of housing that will grow bigger from year to year .
currently around 77@@ 0,000 housing units were missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Gu@@ en@@ ther compl@@ ains , author of the study .
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in need of a flat share in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hotel mo@@ m &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ ur@@ ks in the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined again for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new incentives should stimulate social housing construction again .
thus , the real estate tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats will be suspended for a limited period of time .
in addition , attractive tax depreciation methods are necessary according to the Alliance .
the support programme for refugee camp in the state bank Kf@@ W is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros was available on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia turn into a corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after Hungary , practically no more passage is needed , as more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is still dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have spoken to the Slovenian Minister of the Interior , and if it is necessary we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the death of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reported the Croatian broad@@ ca@@ ster RT@@ L .
Hungary sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which came into force on the same day also obvi@@ ate the need for proper asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , it is people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police attacked the first refugees on Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighbouring country .
according to most media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with the bus as well as taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to cross the green border to Croatia .
at the Croatian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
there are other dangers for this : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90 &apos;s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border hardly any refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 injured people .
just before closing on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws are blocking the overcoming and damaging of the border fence as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thirty @-@ five criminal proceedings were therefore introduced in Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted threatened to prison sentences of up to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the immigration authority , on Tuesday in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; set up at the border , a total of 94 asylum applications were met , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two older people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees stuck there .
practically nobody has a prospect of granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian standards , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; safe third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected waste that had left tens of thousands of people in the last weeks at the road@@ side .
locking grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the reception camps in the Grenz@@ ort has been rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express themselves to the goal of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria is only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
but more than 20,000 migrants still remained in the country after the government &apos;s declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg there are about 1400 people waiting for the journey to Germany .
the train from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing regularly smaller groups of refugees met on foot .
mayor drove &quot; ge@@ str@@ and@@ ete &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with tour luggage stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany surprisingly abandoned rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the rocks along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
prior to that , we have only once verk@@ ö@@ sti@@ gt the un@@ anticipated guests , with snacks and drinks .
we have said , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u .
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N discussion .
they were very grateful .
a man could not take a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that made us very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had moved from an ICE to a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u in order to make it after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
but the regional train was shut down in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn before the border .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , crossing the border is generally high .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest combined with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , day before a double brid@@ ging sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen .
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án will send tens of thousands to us now is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy :
instead of supporting R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp immediately in establishing structures that ensure humanity , our Chancellor has formally and publicly tra@@ cked the Hungarian government &apos;s attitude to the sphere of national socialism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a big challenge given the continued refugee streams and the approaching winter to make decent conditions for smo@@ kers in us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be an even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 Winter@@ tight Quar@@ ters
Konrad has all the hands to do with the provision of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has deployed the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen bank@@ ers to set up neighbour@@ hoods for the thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already gotten a grip on the chaos in the first @-@ time logistics centre in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he reported of his first success . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was also without great confusion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
all in all , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 Quar@@ ters in the he@@ ur@@ n@@ ful year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are to make the countries available , 15,000 of the League .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already had talks with the main tri@@ bun@@ als .
they would have assured him to create neighbour@@ hoods for the coming refugees .
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , to be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations also in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter .
yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times of emergency , it could not be that quarters of a quarter have to observe a certain amount of the towel holder or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a temporary period of time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , in contrast to the ministry of the Interior , was more successful in accommodation , was founded by Konrad with his experience .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to bear any costs , as they themselves stated .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
up to now , the own search for a quarter was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips arena and design centre for refugees planning is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the affected persons are currently able to do without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
other sites should be checked for their suitability for emer@@ gen@@ cies .
the Mayor has critic@@ ised the parti@@ tioning of the refugees in the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) submitted further action on Monday in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the res@@ ignation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
the seek@@ ers would , however , be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T is moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square metres ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the Technology segment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the Star@@ tup @-@ Fir@@ ms of the New Wer@@ ft and later also acquiring which .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the ar@@ cade
in the new shop , Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are at the centre of attention .
J@@ utta is actually trying to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old propriet@@ or of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , she has now received an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where she sells bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and garments from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euro .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks were rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long considered if I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among other things , the decision was that Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Region Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been placed in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
I like most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are in rap@@ ture when they look at a beautiful hand@@ bag , the expert cannot answer with last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag will enhance every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called An@@ ders .
some people also associate with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for set@@ ups .
whether he expresses himself hostile to foreign journalists , or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis policies - the candidate for the U.S. presidential office is vigor@@ ously pushing the election campaign .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate have come from .
the New Yorker with the pam@@ per@@ ing hair@@ do is a term for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to him about -@@ zig corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the city judge Sim@@ one Wen@@ del made a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do vill@@ agers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting somehow , but in their c@@ all@@ stad@@ ter style they are not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has made an am@@ using documentary about the town and its famous children , including Tr@@ ump also the ket@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks at &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - according to the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is already a bit a mo@@ ck@@ ish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name that K@@ all@@ stadt has in the circle was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - zu Hoch@@ deutsch : the don@@ ors , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of the sen@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
first real estate sales in New York were the corner@@ stone of the real estate group .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pfalz belonged to that time .
the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and People &apos;s Do@@ gs , Roland Paul , declared the start of the movie .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border dam to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the Polish , this is not so pleasant , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; Die O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the retired bishop thinks the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so lo@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
do he think Tr@@ ump arrives ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine it , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pension plan Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated a visit to the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine this by Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they would find it better if he didn &apos;t get the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had the sa@@ vag@@ ery at the time of his grandfather in the U.S. would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12 000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , even in the US the interest is awakening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper Bavarian Community of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for Sustainable Tourism in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in neighbouring countries the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise focuses on the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the today show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son hur@@ ry to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there are no big shifts in today &apos;s assessments .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t &apos;s fall .
the rival sunrise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since sunrise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 viewers in the five capitals compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the previous Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 from Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 went .
in September , sunrise with an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 viewers is expected to be 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning people more than parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently swe@@ at@@ y father who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics had wonder@@ ed whether Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e , showed an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour full 7@@ 20,000 .
hot Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20.000 .
the decline of the second evening &apos;s quot@@ as from The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot Se@@ at will eventually prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
secret revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have possibly un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly obviously who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor , was envel@@ op@@ ed in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before coming from three , you may accidentally have given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
all three women have chosen to be ly@@ rical about why wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; her answers could become a ruin , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed Sarah &apos;s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows said .
Sarah is standing on Earth with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ o@@ ki added .
I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks that they and Sam Wood as a couple would be well suited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from their point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now totally tuned to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood had to choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said .
I love the remaining girls in the same way - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on Ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the United States - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a scra@@ m@@ ble as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ se on Tuesday &apos;s 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly strengthened Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Vi@@ kings of Minn@@ es@@ ota
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for for their N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ dream 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a pass took place in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

the Free voters demanded the setting of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
party leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W Aut@@ umn Conference in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get gra@@ dations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Sunday fraction of the Free voters conven@@ es until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
in fact , completely different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugosla@@ vian wars in the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to post@@ p@@ one the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum Ju@@ dges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need uniform standards of federal states throughout Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria moves away , others don &apos;t . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt shall not fall below the table .
a long @-@ standing favourite remains on the agenda : the education policy .
for the new school year , Minister of Education and Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus , &quot; which will be extended from three to four years with an extension of secondary high @-@ level secondary school from three to four years .
but that doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;

hard Wall Street helps D@@ ax jump on the jumps
the German stock market has closed smoothly and nerv@@ ously with profits over long distances .
it was only in the afternoon that a strong start to the US stock markets provided a clear direction that ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards .
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
Tec@@ D@@ ax technology @-@ based Tec@@ D@@ ax grew by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
Euro@@ St@@ ox@@ x 50 as the lead index of the euro area decreased by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points .
the retail outlets in London and Paris also recorded solid profits .
in the United States , the D@@ ow Jones Index recently noted around 1 percent in its sales .
many stock markets anticipate that markets will appear on the market until after the interest rate decision in the US and the large waste on the stock exchanges .
the debate about the burdens arising from nuclear ph@@ asing broke down the RW@@ E shares in a record @-@ depth record and also left its mark on E@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mirrors &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the German energy companies are missing 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government denied the figures mentioned in the press .
as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost always 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) .
Infin@@ eon shares rose by another 3.@@ 22 percent at the D@@ ax head .
according to a dealer , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend .
so investors therefore gave too little attention to the German chip maker .
investment in future @-@ based wafer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out .

4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rub@@ bers on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after rub@@ bing rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that prot@@ ested against the proposed new constitution , said an official on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i district , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , some of whom threw stones and fire@@ bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before res@@ or@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber shells used , which are known to be able to kill but are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , obviously produced such a high mortality rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ers say that new provinces that are formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution will dimin@@ ish their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal from the ethnic group of Th@@ ose who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces , an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been ruled centrally for centuries .
the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators have voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu this week , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be built again .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meters area .
a mixture of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4,000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mixture of trade , commerce and living .
wait for appropriate offers , that is , the city .
which investor would be questioned is not yet clear .
accordingly , no contracts had been concluded .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property that is located at Ring@@ straße / corner Great Street , bought some months ago and the building will be torn down .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday house at the Small Sea near Em@@ den is taking shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several residents are still worried - they fear the sale of their leisure agent
for months behind closed doors were negotiated , clou@@ ded , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now there are plans for a new holiday house at the little sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the prospective customer , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; publicly presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ de Council urban development committee .
originally this point had stood on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP faction , which accused the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive from the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors right now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro project has been in discussion for months .
violent reactions among the Meer@@ bus@@ den land@@ owners who had come to the meeting called out the images and new details about the desired hotel construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , Marine owner and member of the Executive Board at the reconciliation of interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a huge block that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , like many other project critics , he fears that traffic would increase greatly due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus charging so that it pays off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well @-@ known area of the former inn , however , is still open .
nor is there any operator .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we need to have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the development plans were still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( C@@ f . O ) announced a dou@@ bling campaign to raise € 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ rolled the European nations , as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announc@@ ing the donations call on his blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
the donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally clu@@ stered donations tot@@ aled $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / ent@@ el@@ low to $ 11 million .
Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which exp@@ elled more than 4 million people this year .
many also fled from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .

weight loss can be helpful for obes@@ e people .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last for at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to say whether obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss sur@@ geri@@ es or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been conducted in people who are obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or above .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ an Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they have collected since 2007 in a study , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c tu@@ bing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent surgery sank from 31 to 24@@ ,5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus dis@@ integrated totally and at 28 % .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes in comparison with diabetes was completely reduced by only one percent and partly with only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally improved in the &apos; surgical group &apos; , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the patient &apos;s blood levels of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this improved &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , leading researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results of the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ pe@@ x Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 2.1 % ) and had a more complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study does not show survival benefit after five years , there are indications from a study of heavy people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery were about 29 percent less likely to die within 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study did not show an advantage for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for persons with a BM@@ I below 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient is with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long to take people seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that once they have accumulated the genetic make @-@ up that their bodies have linked with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is becoming increasingly popular in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school hours , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the love story , the novel is particularly interesting for Hun@@ sr@@ ück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the main professional writer grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is glad that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it &apos;s impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama , and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader encouraged to end violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which is devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be put before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that anyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite the efforts of the Dalai Lama in Germany and Austria to meet the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of 11 September and found that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
4 @-@ fold increase in the intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centers in the USA report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swal@@ low the strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , cases of in@@ comes of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years reported to report toxic control centers , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are landing in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children d@@ rank disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers can only drink infection products for a cheap experience .
teenagers have re@@ port@@ edly mixed dis@@ infection products with non @-@ alcoholic beverages in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; Lop@@ ez said .
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison control centre in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 transmitter in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t leave a si@@ p whis@@ key around , but people leave this hand dis@@ infection agent within reach of children , and when children come to it , it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry du@@ st@@ ening disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was taken to an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is regarded as drunk by an adult as drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor , who treated them in the W@@ inn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ul@@ ed her words and was not able to go as she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and hit her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos; mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and store hand dis@@ infection agents beyond the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed after swal@@ lowing suspended disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a le@@ thal solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York State decided to poison their &quot; gem@@ s &quot; teacher by applying anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to hand disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished her from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police considered the s@@ worn @-@ out plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bab@@ bling &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and pointed out disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the round@@ about towards the industrial area and took too late to realize that two preceding cars had stopped at the round@@ about .
as a result , he colli@@ ded with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ tor and pushed this vehicle to a preceding Ford Fi@@ esta .
damage to the vehicles involved in the accident occurred about 10 000 euros , noti@@ fying the police .

the lack of title competition in the Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they show no more highlights of Cel@@ tic games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the ran@@ gers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they talk about Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian director s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat of Malm@@ ö and the following exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had previously had bad times and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel this exactly the way - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
to stand together now is so important .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost a year since Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
drunk interfer@@ ed the process
as the security staff could not satisfy the situation , the staff called the police .
only with the use of pepper spray the officials were able to take the stor@@ ks into custody .
a respir@@ ation @-@ alcohol test resulted in a 16 @-@ year @-@ old 0,@@ 89 per mil@@ le .
the adolescents were picked up by his mother .
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and remained in custody .
why I &apos;m witness@@ ing an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except in late legal action , I will see how a man is brought to death .
when it happens and I hope it doesn &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the po@@ ison@@ ous sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed I agreed .
when the day drew near , I began to fear .
so , why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available as places , mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected .
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
those who are selected will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship with phone calls over the months and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I &apos;m not allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of aband@@ oning my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained about her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have formulated it better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he was doing it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against capital punishment .
Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go into all details again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe there is a strong possibility that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters that you can turn to .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die of unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale Poli@@ z@@ ist remained dry when he persu@@ aded the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to hang down the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
C@@ anning V@@ ale &apos;s police were called on Tuesday to a break @-@ in incident in Becken@@ ried .
when they discovered the susp@@ ects , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t get too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
landscape football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , cous@@ ins drove his car in the tren@@ ches to escape alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired natives to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria have tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria , claiming that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive cob@@ alt test sample at Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age repro@@ aches and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too much hanging grapes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
tonight I will go home and sleep well .
I want to walk around my head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a coach anymore .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , M@@ oo@@ dy had sent the bomb in an interview with rac@@ use to spy on the integrity section trying to spy out his stall .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on rac@@ ing.com .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to hold me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ ami , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today .
should this lead me to believe that it is going to be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly attitude and perhaps make people outside trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say now lets them think about it .
but I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s frustr@@ ations level was built up with the long @-@ lasting Li@@ dar@@ i cob@@ alt examination , and the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching added that he said he could &quot; cast his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the beaten master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , called the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s deb@@ auch , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mistakenly put mud on my leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day that was so .
but it had it on the race day as well .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested by driver flight
the police arrested a man on the weekend after a clas@@ h with a cycli@@ st and a subsequent driver flight in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured rider .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals because of alleg@@ ations about ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees had allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm triumph in Sydney &apos;s qualifying lap on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a scar@@ c@@ ely disgu@@ ised comment about the storm team after his team had achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in singing .
Bell@@ amy advoc@@ ated the fli@@ ck@@ ering lim@@ b of his team and said that at Tac@@ kl@@ ing they were focused only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being hit by the storm team .
&quot; it &apos;s time and time again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday .
I can guarantee that we did not change anything in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has done the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now and obviously he has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is funny how this is appearing again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy attacked the idea of &quot; thrilling soccer , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting soccer .
he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday night and how exciting it was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy .
I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and which we see exciting , especially his young players at their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t so they can play as they can .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game bron@@ cos vs. cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is this an exciting game ?
or are breaks and no points a bit exciting ?
for me it is the game boards .
if they mention us , it means that in a phase we will still meet them .
the storm team was free this weekend as they won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 Guarant@@ ee on Drug Ad@@ diction
a man who could possibly face a life penalty for his attempt to get possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants at the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
in spite of a potentially life sentence for an attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the attorney of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire amount and that in the café might have been a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of the criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security coll@@ ectively to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ stain@@ s from his Australian and his Ser@@ b passport , reports to the police every day and is holding a cur@@ few at 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s house tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the Motor@@ way 5 at Karlsruhe a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three trucks involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left at the last moment , as the police announced .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing manufacturer was completely apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked for six hours until 2 am .
there was a loss of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a P@@ äd@@ op@@ hil@@ er used the phone of an 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ woke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the dor@@ man@@ t Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web research that used terms for the search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg said to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the internet &quot; and then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are them . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said to Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked after his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computers and Pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he was .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty on the basis of the In@@ dict@@ ment to have in@@ decent images taken by children on June 14 last year , viol@@ ating the requirements and not appearing in court for a hearing on 24 March of this year .
defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im asked that Hos@@ gg did not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ mes , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael sp@@ ends the verdict until October to obtain background reports on social work .
in this case , Ho@@ gg was given a security deposit but was rem@@ anded in custody due to hear@@ ings on other pending cases .
he was added to the list of sexual offen@@ ders before the date of the ruling .
tra@@ ilers switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points at the German @-@ Austrian border .
many s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers left the people increasingly on smaller border cross@@ ings due to fear of discovery and arrest .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
along the river river inn , more than 1000 refugees have been picked up in the Land@@ kreise of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday .
they were on foot over bridges and du@@ mps on the German side .
there they are received by federal police and forwarded to the registry .
in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday , the Munich Central Station again clearly met more refugees .
some 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8.@@ 00 am , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city .
Stuttgart : foo@@ th@@ ills of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; await in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm ra@@ fts in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) announced in Stuttgart for a low pressure area covering Western Europe .
the powerful low is the bo@@ unc@@ er of the &quot; Henry &quot; tropical storm , which has been dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in recent days .
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are mainly expected in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , even up to Thursday early also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and the Lake Con@@ se@@ au with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday , the sun can be seen again longer .
the crowd makes it happen : every two years , the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , it is especially noticeable that the compact cars are particularly well @-@ selling .
cars from the compact class are currently in great demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of the new registr@@ ations were accounted for by the Federal Labor Authority ( KBA ) alone in August in this segment .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be introduced this year between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars and luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in the autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model is also well sold , the new Astra should not be much more expensive .
Opel makes a entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in view , starting at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the H@@ esse also offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time to include three @-@ cylinder petrol engines .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially just a fifth @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which is also visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA in new compact cars ?
Renault Meri@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra rival to the race .
at the trade fair , the Mé@@ go@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and an accentu@@ ated sporty GT version .
he will be trading in the stores at the beginning of next year , and then as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan install@@ ers want to find its position in the strongly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines perfectly fits into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ litre tur@@ bo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s instructions .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not entirely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger put their hand on the front part : the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , a series of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI , were added at the IAA in the compact class .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy of human dignity
the Federal Constitutional Court gave a right to an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee of the bai@@ li@@ ff of the bai@@ li@@ ff , which was housed in a small cell for months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners generally have the right to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
as a result , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was housed in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally not separated .
after that , the man , who , according to the information of his lawyer , is now on the open foot , was transferred to a larger cell .
his public liability claim because of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ examination .
they see man &apos;s dignity hurt .
court ruling now decides on the amount of compensation
even if , for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were eligible for compensation from the question@@ able period , it was said that it was a matter of reconciliation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ als must now clarify the amount of compensation for money .
in the past , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
in April they only spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee because he was naked in a cell .
according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ worthy .
in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which , in a parallel case in a parallel case , had reached a decent housing in a parallel case in November 2009 .
the then plain@@ ti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell , as in the case of Car@@ ls@@ bad .
in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons in Berlin have also hit the head@@ lines due to lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness asc@@ ends , even massac@@ res should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of a young lack of talent , 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and refugee policy : &quot; we are creating that &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany ?
about 800@@ ,000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year according to forecasts made by the Federal Ministry of the Interior , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what comes to Germany gives the following overview .
according to a number of progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Building ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) , they are used every year for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has been built so far ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of housing is dramatic , above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing fall out of the rental price , and in order to find these particularly favorable housing , refugees will also apply .
Federal Minister for Agriculture , Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) , wants to double the funding from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
this is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to be created and the federal government would have to invest a grant of 6.@@ 4 billion per year .
the researchers and the Federal Minister of Agriculture agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , refugees in Germany were not systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees it is crucial if they find work in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ um@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hold , there has been a political shift : from the prohibition of labour to refugees for recognition of work .
whereas previously there was a ban on working for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the residen@@ cy light restric@@ ting asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society , even because of the shortage of skilled personnel , it has mostly been realised that refugees should be allowed to access the labour market more quickly .
the lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
so far there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often im@@ par@@ ted through personal contacts .
therefore , according to th@@ ron@@ d@@ hardt , the construction of networks is the Royal Road to work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few fled @-@ wing parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , estimated at least ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ sche@@ del , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nonetheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators increase significantly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase educational capacity - for example by allowing more vocational training schools .
in the countries , students without knowledge of German are prepared in the class of welcome classes .
however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ immer from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle no federal land asylum seek@@ ers or tolerated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned his stance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; student @-@ willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for refugees with a refund or salary no longer receive services according to the asylum seek@@ er performance law if they start a study .
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to death .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tolerated refugees have had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for af@@ ö@@ g , from January 1 , 2016 , this gap will be shortened to 15 months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but this financing gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
the students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should succ@@ essively abandon the same rights as they have the churches , and continue to develop the existing state churches law into a new state of religion .
the founding of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association would also be of great importance , taking care of the newcom@@ ers in a professional manner .
the rights are also duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact partners and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant them certain control options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also involves the willingness to take heed to religious fundament@@ alism .
the chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to stra@@ y such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately gave their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed transl@@ ating the Basic Law to Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the majority society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and rac@@ ism is urgent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany , as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade now . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U assass@@ ination series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white German are demanding for a long time and for what international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention commit Germany must become reality in the coming years when the country should remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
generally speaking , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees that have been expected so far , &quot; says Dr. Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , President of the Association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as far as man@@ - power and capacities are concerned , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery ur@@ ges all of the newcom@@ ers to hand over health cards immediately .
rendered services could later be settled with the federal states .
and in the long term it is highly question@@ able to withdraw so many people with the limited power catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er performance law fores@@ ees .
apart from that , the doctors first of all make the language barrier possible .
as far as so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are getting worse about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in doctor &apos;s sur@@ geri@@ es , translation costs would have to be taken over , she demands .
it would have helped many refugees but also with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
there are clearly more un@@ treated disabilities in refugee children , and in young people it is about HIV enligh@@ tenment .
in some cases German doctors come from their training but clear , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; par@@ asi@@ tism or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so hard to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and what concerns the doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doctors &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may even be allevi@@ ated by the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syri@@ ans would have developed a highly developed educational system ; some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ically ill according to estimates by the Federal Ro@@ of @-@ Ro@@ of therapy ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most of them suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
particularly vulnerable are refugee children , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
those suffering from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beats and fear of death .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , Mun@@ z explained .
up to now only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
although mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers can apply for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , the treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices , cler@@ ics or doctors , who are not trained for mental illness , would decide whether therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to captiv@@ ate every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst in the Man@@ ege on the brick invites to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Tibetan teacher and junior chef .
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto of the current man@@ e@@ gen@@ esis .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
the gift for fan@@ atics is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to us to take people away from their daily routine and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with a cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst in his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to pick up easily .
ease and mobility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
apart from numerous sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst is fascinating with a feeling of dex@@ ter@@ ity and jo@@ in@@ iness .
balance on a ball with the un@@ ic@@ ycle ?
for He Yuan is not a problem .
sn@@ ak@@ y people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics just as little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephen &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal protection organisations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst takes a stand : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if our animals are not good , we are not doing well . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read off by the eyes of every wish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the arena .
the upper@@ most commandment : ensure good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra stu@@ d@@ ded , the family Pro@@ bst is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but suddenly , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the cir@@ cus yet , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of the cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or one 200 spectators , we always do our best and with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst starting from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 : 00 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program ki@@ cks off at 11 am and 4 pm .
Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are reduced .

Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , desc@@ ended from a platform at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread across the social media .
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to follow Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s response with peti@@ tions .
last month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the affected Parliament members that the immunity in parliament will end and as soon as they leave parliament its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard will de@@ construct up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing business hardware and service business activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who is supposed to lead the unit after the separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and expanded portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ parall@@ eled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; explains the company .
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard in order to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one called &quot; the birth@@ place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring in order to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the belief that tightly focused businesses produce a better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and insofar as his rehabilitation is proceeding according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play back before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England , and in view of his story his participation in the next summer is certainly still uncertain .
the great dis@@ grace with this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had strongly finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not end@@ anger the career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not related to his an@@ kl@@ es or the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries whenever a player tries to return right in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has listed 23 different types of Wil@@ sh@@ ere disease since its debut six years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 League matches in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of ar@@ senal is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs , which recorded the most infrin@@ gement stage .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a long period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ ses , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind he deserves .
ar@@ senal begins his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur , next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are allowed to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need it to take a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Ar@@ senal &apos;s clear favorite are to pass through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir @-@ Stadion in Zagreb belongs to the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dating effect in Europe .
after 41 games , Dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten after the inv@@ inci@@ ble campaign has been launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday night , measured at the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 .
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has raised the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains motivated by the far hope of leading the association to its first European Cup victory .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked out at Ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show , which gives us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
the absence of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to the need for men to open up , now more desperate than ever before , as self @-@ murder of young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more common in men than women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) was announced in 2015 as the year of the man to question the culture that hin@@ ders men from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is the heart of the battle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms established that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
in the age of communication guided through social media , with emphasis on style on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship which affects our mental health much deeper .
and like a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the great thing about friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ ed through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the y@@ earning of Ross to Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even though they often hold back to explore their feelings completely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of telep@@ hon@@ y care I explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ mitting suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
the old saying &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , such as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one talks about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer longer @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it presents clearly the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest this weekend with the scenery completely re@@ designed to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you bring your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
Maria meets at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met in less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the way , but thereafter they missed a number of occasions before they finally got their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head@@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as they do not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown @-@ team and against the association with whom he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and look back relaxed even if there are certain things we have to perfect over the season , &quot; Blanc comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury in one of three changes , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 Draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was exp@@ elled by Di Maria in the fourth minute .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing @-@ storm was called the man who could take PS@@ G to the next level in Europe , when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why , when he passed in Marco Ver@@ ra@@ tis Pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before completing Johan Wil@@ ay in the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to reach that level , joined in with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went by far to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ si@@ les and bad degrees , last but not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who scrat@@ ched in the first half in no less than five trials and then abandoned after he had used it after the re@@ boot .
nevertheless he showed a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who transformed the Di Maria into a spin , which was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an was the sixth of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c caught a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent score of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been recognized at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champion league game was last year in December .
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying games don &apos;t suff@@ ice . &quot;
hat@@ s off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through share sales
the mining Ri@@ ese Gl@@ en@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , is affected by falling commodity prices , collected 2.5 billion dollars by a share sale as part of its huge debt collection plan on Wednesday .
the Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth approximately € 1.6 billion to pay off its own debt .
the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , struggles with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic decline expresses demand and has a devastating effect on markets .
the issue of subscription rights granted a rapid increase to the core of the London Stock Exchange when trading in the early Wednesday morning .
the share j@@ umped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher .
Gl@@ en@@ core last week announced the $ 2.5 billion of share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its $ 30 billion debt .
the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 P@@ ence per share , which represents a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday .
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent .
refugees arrive in Weimar

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change to FC Bayern 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times winner Champion , four times champion league winners , two times champion champi@@ ons , two times champion champi@@ ons , one time world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking .
in the summer the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i reveals that he was already standing before the European Championship in 2008 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I told me that Bar@@ ça wants to sell me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid did everything at that time , we don &apos;t know , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the FC Bayern was also registered .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rum@@ bl@@ ings wanted me to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern .
guar@@ ola was the reason why X@@ av@@ i didn &apos;t change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this work today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted guar@@ ola and I have played a great EM . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the team without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he has got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s playing time in 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter final of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the lawn , out@@ dated the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s triumph at the end .
matt Dam@@ on to Play Di@@ versity in Movie Mak@@ ing
matt Dam@@ on confronted the African film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown while discussing the diversity and said that she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a succession of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives on behalf of a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen scenario .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then you do it with the occupation of the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
&quot; &quot; &quot; brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ l brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to invite people to think about - whoever will be the director - how they handle the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nun , who is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p .
the producer of Dear White People set up for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on responded that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Mr Po@@ oni &apos;s Twitter user expressed anger over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 likes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ age teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a nation @-@ wide effect and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against farmers .
in February , the singer Prince launched an all@@ usion to the movement while introducing the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album sil@@ ently matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums always have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
more recently , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and user help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 Million .
the competition show , which completed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman , Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was to climb on a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge in three seconds quicker , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never deser@@ ved or had more than $ 10,000 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his pile of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so all of a sudden ... as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and the life changes , he gets the great ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting any gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt as if they had sw@@ apped the rolls .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit &apos;s Tig@@ ers passes by Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint AP@@ O@@ L@@ ISH --@@ the second half of the season was not very funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb inside a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card .
for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all victories make fun no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad Aus@@ mus .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three races .
it was only his third successful start in his final nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bul@@ l@@ bar any game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated in the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit @-@ game since he had four hits against the Seattle Navy on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the wood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better at the Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in am@@ bush at the end of the seventh inning , T@@ wins had their best chance to get back into the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks accomplished a Bun@@ t , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ yle to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before it was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy sur@@ passed the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who had a two @-@ run indign@@ ant at the righ@@ th@@ and Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run on the second , Ver@@ hagen delivered the third bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the Major League &apos;s leading 27 times this season that pl@@ ou@@ ging hit a double play
after adding an insurance @-@ run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , Wall created a RB@@ I double against the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed ban@@ quet ho@@ ist@@ ed S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit prof@@ ited at the start of the game by an even not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been removed from the injury list before the game , after he had been missing more than a month due to a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
when they got the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter first , Hus@@ ky delivered a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into the game who created a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right , managed to run another run but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers ranked second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE on the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he did not beat very well , but he got the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever righ@@ th@@ et A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three hits with six hits and a walk with four stro@@ kes .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throw lessons .
he is examined by Dr James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , which has been on the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , is scheduled to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the vulner@@ ability list to launch against T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the tiger , since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30th July
he has been missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three playing in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to come to Wiesbaden

the people who travelled there should then be accommod@@ ated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden communicated on Tuesday evening .
it reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .

they should then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days alone , according to the pres@@ idency of the governing party , Gie@@ ßen 7@@ 500 people arrived in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sport halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe that decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective direction &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of military participation in Germany passed .
&quot; now the conflict ends at our door@@ step , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk .
the former German ambassador in Washington also demanded a massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced checks at its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Minister for the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in Austrian television broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , no one will be sent back to Hungary .
Germany too did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , that &apos;s how it was agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to an agreement in which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , Mr Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the Director General for Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives of Germany .
she did not call concrete numbers and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary .
their destination is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann , together with several other EU heads of state and government , requested a special summit for next week .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not yet been able to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the strong refugee tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory in Germany , the Federal Government wants to strengthen the countries with the initial up@@ take and distribution of the people .
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four hours of deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who needed protection would get this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a pencil perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either .
this view had been unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 km long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania was also tied down with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungary wants to prevent tu@@ gs from looking for ev@@ asive transport across Romania , &quot; said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to witnesses reports in Turkey , thousands of other migrants started their way to the Greek border .

researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
therefore the moon easily stag@@ gers on its orbit around the ring planet .
this exchange of arms is only small , but nevertheless too great for a permanently fixed heavenly body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the specialist journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it has been known for some time that it has to give liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2006 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of the Satur@@ n@@ monds that sp@@ it water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; e @-@ ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of Saturn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time .
but the extent of the hidden ocean has not been clari@@ fied .

according to the Munich @-@ based Lion , the diagnosis &quot; is expected to take four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , with a view of the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive one as training guest .

no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because man@@ goes contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
nevertheless , the exotic fruits are healthy : in them are B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. How@@ ever , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene pre@@ amplifier .
the person who eats the fruits supports vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when you buy , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and eaten within a few days .
then they taste pure or in sweet dishes .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to hear@@ ty dishes .
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .

Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park was christ@@ ened on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Re@@ former .
at &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as the &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often live their faith only in disgu@@ ise for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) beha@@ ved as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 several months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a rotten man of sin .
according to histori@@ ans his negative impressions will probably have strengthened him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his theses about the after@@ no@@ ons .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms - but which is by no means equivalent to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , this can be quite glo@@ omy .
Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for about three years , for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles which dev@@ ote subjects such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or fa@@ therhood .
he has immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his focus on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he interpre@@ ts the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into today into the present context .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ert &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to have a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict prot@@ est@@ ant ruler of Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter .
&quot; the education had already happened with the cane , &quot; rec@@ alls Ot@@ mar Alt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work out this , perhaps to bring me back with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second aim is to re @-@ emp@@ ower art in a faster time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today marked by advertisement , and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; fall &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and sense what force they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; always &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
old did not pay attention to fully compreh@@ ending the Bible , but also selected the topics that are important to him , including mysterious subjects .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text only explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on November 15 at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt Foundation .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans made , place found , companies commissioned , earth hill for a circuit model@@ ed : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already over again .
failures in politics and administration ensured dr@@ ink@@ ness , especially among the residents who did not want to tolerate the run@@ way .
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the permission will go down in October , the first public coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now share in the Child and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be begun without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further remembrance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the work of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees in 2019 , with the Bundes@@ li@@ ga a clear sign on the weekend .
football is re@@ acting to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures politics its help in tackl@@ ing the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge in our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone is interested in getting this issue under control , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he intends to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the minister Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football could and want to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
for this reason , the German Football Association has extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on this weekend the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will carry the printing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wir - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the left edge sleeve instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler from the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is all about , nobody can see it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can help football feder@@ ates , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director , Peter Ret@@ tig , spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
the national team of women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication Game against Hungary on this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that all 36 license associations have started their own projects in their locations is great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and next year , the association , together with the DF@@ B and the Federal Government , will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief executive officer loses an eye on accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye by a fall in early July .
in the case of the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s almost ble@@ ed , was power@@ less , then threw himself out on the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; SAP Co @-@ Fo@@ under Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his work .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said Platt@@ ner .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and is &quot; full working . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to run the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is important to wake up once you have fallen . &quot;

Bv@@ B without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ der@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us have finally broken down in the first group game of the Europa League .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga in du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot resort to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Re@@ us will be present in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the BV@@ B coach said openly : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
given the high intensity of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its 11th position on the Re@@ us position .
thus he announced a change to the goal jumping position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of family @-@ keepers Roman bür@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the world champion .
however , Tu@@ ch@@ el opened up whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe @-@ league games in the future .
with high probability he will also dispute the second game .
the for@@ en@@ sic statement by fellow players Re@@ us that the final decision for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has to be the goal , mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l holds for understandable : &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership role for Germany
according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany should be technological van@@ guard in the course of changing the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on a strategy paper from the house of Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , anticip@@ ates investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the IAA in Frankfurt on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase road safety and provide less traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ part from the G@@ 7 states coming together with industry representatives at the IAA .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a fast upgrade to digital radio communication .
a test track is currently being tested on the 9 motorway in Bavaria for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; assume no additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Germany wants to use internationally for example , that the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
in addition , the Federal Government intends to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passengers .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only far to 2020 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the Germany site appreci@@ ates the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD traffic politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability in cases of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clari@@ fied .
however , the Germans still look skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent only reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all .
in France , 21 per cent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed expect autonomous driving cars up to 20@@ 25 , and 33 per cent in the USA .
in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
according to a survey by the digital association Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads .
on the motorway , this could show 15 percent in flowing traffic , 45 percent in traffic jams .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every fourth person would not leave control under any circumstances . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ oll says team and double start at table tennis EM
according to the current status of the title fight , the Düsseldorf @-@ Düsseldorf wants only to hit the single individual from the 25th of September to the 4th of October .
the final decision shall be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys learned it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ meister Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European semester in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German Master is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite , &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov .
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also remembered the 2013 European Championships in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; explained the World Ran@@ king Fi@@ fth .
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an enf@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ fying human@@ ly thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show on his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a little bit of death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when one dies , one enters the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the barely survi@@ ving oeu@@ vre of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort has been done : to freeze the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list has been specifically hired .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tons of material .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , timi@@ d fashion experiments by the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , Gau@@ l@@ tier said .
to play with a doll his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself how to design fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t afford the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
Je@@ wel@@ ry instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze as a fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and lace were created in large quantities for customers who , for example , worked on ceilings and curtains .
that alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en gran@@ aries .
instead , fashion is again important .
in the beginning times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role and was then displaced by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories like bags and in regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styles , bil@@ de an increasing contractor &apos;s potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
with us , they account for half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery industry association with nine other companies .
only they must wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there is almost no more private business and wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
exports are also weak@@ ening , up to now to Russia and the United States .
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score points with respect to environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the Stick@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have been running a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally friendly and socially compatible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the University of Applied Sciences of the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
to counter competition from the Asian region , you need to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
it takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a conflict between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the companies that must think above all economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historical snow@@ ball point .
the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith masters Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball point for her jewelry .
in a complex process , she shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in le@@ eches and surroundings and who want to have a mem@@ ento .
with it I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
legends are not to be touched , but Disney vent@@ ures into a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot;
according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not a new movie but a kind of sequ@@ el that plays with the magic n@@ anny for 20 years after the first film .
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
but the director is already standing : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema .
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy needs to open wider and wider to foster growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group that was tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investments and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Command Council for the deep@@ ening of comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote start @-@ ups and promote reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , X@@ i said .
the Leadership Group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the local reporting system .
after the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified which are not eligible for investments .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is important since it as@@ signs the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , guarantees a right @-@ wing business environment and makes the market open , the statement said .
the government will also l@@ ure control over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border regions to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; moreover , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optimizing the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;

EU wants to double mercury limit value in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to limit the consumption to consumers with a significantly higher dose of the nervous system .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who has a corresponding EU work paper , sharply critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failing industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant and small children , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be increased from one milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram of fish to two milli@@ grams of mercury .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that around 50 percent of the cat@@ ches may not be sold on the basis of the still valid limits .
after dou@@ bling the threshold values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ able .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; trick &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries , such as car@@ p , are generally so low that they already comply with the planned maximum values .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of cl@@ ones is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dy distra@@ ction manoeu@@ vre that helps the economy alone &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which accum@@ ulates in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish above all in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause damage to the nervous system particularly in case of un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected .
mercury enters the environment primarily through coal combustion .
according to a written reference from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants exp@@ ire more than six tonnes of mercury per year , two thirds of the total amount issued in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; long @-@ lasting and nationwide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings about mercury in fish have already been among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
