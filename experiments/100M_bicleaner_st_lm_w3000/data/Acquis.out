any claim that the community or state is asser@@ ted against the organization or organisation vis @-@ à @-@ vis the association or a state for damages - except for damages arising from a nuclear incident - which have ar@@ isen from carrying out the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , will be governed in accordance with international law .
after examining the relevant information submitted by the General Director , the Council shall ensure that the Organization shall not be able to verify that no nuclear material , which must be subject to security measures pursuant to this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II , Section C of the Statutes and , if necessary , take the other measures fores@@ een there .
in such steps , the Council takes into account the degree in which weight has been acquired by the applied security measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security .
on request of the Organization , Community or State , consultations take place on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention .
the Community and the States are entitled to request that any questions arising out of the interpretation or application of such an agreement must be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in discussing such questions by the Council .
except for disputes referring to the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any measure adopted by the Council , disputes arising out of the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be accompanied by proceedings that are not agreed in the negotiation process or by another by the Organization , Community and States , to submit to an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal , consisting of five arbit@@ rators .
the community and the states appoint two arbit@@ rators , the organization also ren@@ ames two arbit@@ rators , and the four arbit@@ rators , named so , elect a fifth , which leads the pres@@ idency .
if the Community and States or the Organization have not named two arbit@@ rators in thirty days after the application for an Ar@@ bit@@ ration , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint those refer@@ ees .
the same procedure is applicable if the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not been elected within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator .
a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators .
the decisions of the Court of Ar@@ bit@@ ration are binding for the organization , the community and the states concerned .
a ) This Convention enters into force for non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the association ( in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organisation notes that its procedures for the entry into force of this convention are completed and

&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this Agreement comprises the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable to implement the provisions of part I on securing measures .
the aim of the safety measures laid down in this Convention is the timely detection of the diver@@ gence of significant quantities of nuclear power for nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of early detection .
in order to obtain the target set out in Article 28 , material book@@ keeping shall be used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verbal integration and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the tests carried out by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the quantity of material that is not proven for a specified period is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified ranges .
in carrying out their check @-@ ups , the organisation makes full use of the Community &apos;s security system in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown of material balance zones .
in applying their preventive measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following manner and , as far as necessary , anticipate how they are determined in the supplementary agreements and are functional :
a ) a measurement system for determining the amounts of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise removed core material and stock quantities ;
B ) ass@@ essing the reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measurement uncertainty ;
C ) procedures for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sen@@ ders and recipients ;
e ) procedures for the valuation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a log and report system that indicates the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone for each material balance zone ;
g ) provisions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Procedure for reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
B ) If ur@@ an@@ ium or th@@ orium containing the phase of the core fuel cycle described in the letter c ) is not yet reached , the association of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) Le@@ ave the material that is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment by composition and purity , or if this core material or other core material produced in a later phase of the core fuel cycle is introduced into states , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . however , if the provisions stated in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the Community is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues , so the organization and community consult each other about the application of suitable securing measures .
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 13 provided that the Organization and the Community agree that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on the request of the Community the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the security measures in accordance with this Convention :
a ) special spl@@ itting material when used in grams - or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
( B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on the request of the Community , the Organization &apos;s core material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures in accordance with this Convention , exemp@@ ts from these security measures , provided that the total material quantity delivered in the States at no time is at any time more than
a ) a total of one kilogram of extra foldable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
( II ) Ur@@ an with an accumulation of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with the enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an with enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying his weight with the five @-@ fold square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) Tw@@ enty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if the core material is to be processed or stored together with the core material , which is subject to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for the re@@ application of the securing measures to that material .
the Community meets with the Organization of supplementary agreements necessary to determine the extent necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organisation pursuant to this Convention , in detail how the procedures specified in the Convention shall apply .
the supplementary agreements can be extended or modified without alter@@ ing the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort so that these agreements may enter into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period shall require the agreement between the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the Organization provides a summari@@ zed inventory of all the core material underlying the securing measures of this convention in the States , regardless of its origin , and carries on this inventory list as a result of the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EW@@ G decided to contribute to the special action programme defined at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imped@@ ed by universal resource transfer problems .
C ) It is the goal of the EEC and the Member States that the total contribution made by Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement is bound and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bin@@ dings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is pur@@ pos@@ ely determined by the intended use of the criteria set out in this agreement -
the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the term &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement ; this account is referred to and used by the Organization as Administrator ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Managing Director &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the special transaction account is separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the dues are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ comparable bonds issued by the Member State to pay upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organisation as administrator of the transaction account and to deposit at the organisation in question in the country concerned .
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , and the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker at the agreed time ;
II ) the second in the amount of the rest of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may , upon request , make payments before the above dates .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the ste@@ ward takes about proportional moves to the cash or the school j@@ owl to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and to balance the transaction in a reasonable manner .
in granting this loan , the ste@@ ward can be governed by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
( VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ qualification ; and
VII ) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and quickly payable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is considered , approved , approved and managed in accordance with the methods and practices used for the organisation financed by ordinary funding of the organization , taking into account the objective of the ass@@ ump@@ tions mentioned under letter b ) of this agreement .
the funds of the transaction may not be used instead of ord@@ able funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organisation , which is tied to a programme or project in the context of a loan or loan that has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s Directors or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions , which generally apply to the development loans granted by the organization ; therefore , they are ref@@ und@@ able in ten free years each in 50 years .
transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this tari@@ ff are directly to the organization that it reserves .
each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in particular the source of the funds is stated .
the proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or used ( ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction loan based on what the administrator has set at the time of the loan guarantee .
capital re@@ payments of transaction loans are made to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State concerned .
until full assignment of all special loans , the Administrator informs the EEC of the intentions and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors .
during the time of withdrawal of the transaction loan , the Administrator obli@@ ges the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this purpose .
the Administrator obli@@ ges the EEC soon as possible after the end of the business year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization at this account end .
after full payment of the transaction loan , the Administrator of the EEC soon conve@@ ys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes suitable records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid from the account recei@@ pts , the amounts paid to the account and deposits received from the account and the re@@ payments to the Member States are obvious .
the EEC and the ste@@ wards work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ ward up to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by the transaction , and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this Agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the EEC and the Organisation may not enter into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be due immediately .
if the total amount of capital paid by the bene@@ fici@@ aries is withdrawn in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement and transferred back to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States note the exclusion of the proceedings concerned to the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ retariat for@@ wards these noti@@ fications along with a notification about the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the named noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . each wording is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter of exchange to am@@ end the Annex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be ruled out - HA@@ T en@@ acted the following issue :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled fusion and plasma physics
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN Atom@@ ic Community , herein@@ after called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Eur@@ atom &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the consent of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on Mobili@@ zation of the recei@@ v@@ ables of the Member States within the medium term financial support
the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by credit tables with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks present a corresponding request .
the agreement could be concluded up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the Mechan@@ ism Mechan@@ ism , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ icing units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery terms for the member countries .
already now , however , some conditions have been called , for which the BI@@ S would be prepared .
with each stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without it being exceeded a total of five years .
in the case of the opening of the credit as well as for the extension of the credit , the BI@@ S would charge a credit issu@@ er commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first drawing should not be made before the exp@@ iry of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be taking into account the means of the bank , probably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those employed by the BI@@ S at the time specified under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to proc@@ ure the necessary funds on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to the margin increased by the corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could include stand@@ by credit tables with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks present a corresponding request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would give me the consent of the Council of the European Communities to do so . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic concerning the trade with amm@@ el and lamb
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- Fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the Community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) .
in order to ensure an un@@ objec@@ tion@@ able functioning of the agreement Argentina is obliged to ensure that the actual amount of the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out ( frozen or cooled ) in accordance with the conventional offer forms .
should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community is entitled to the protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the common market regulated by this agreement is not affected .
in the event that imports from Argentina within a year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the remainder of the year .
the Community is obliged to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of articles collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .

the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; here , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ inction of the exhaus@@ tion referred to under number 5 is taken into account .
the total amount known as number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the Community on 23@@ ,000 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the commerci@@ alization of Argent@@ ine amm@@ el and lamb meat in the collective market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions in order for the sale of frozen meat to be under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the regulation in the sales of Argent@@ ine amm@@ el and lamb . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other promotion measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb meat as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs will only be given at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ dependence and Trade Agreement .
Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by granting licenses for the products mentioned under the number 1 within the agreement specified in this Agreement .
the Community , on its part , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the above @-@ mentioned products is made dependent on the presentation of an export licence , which is given by the responsible body designated by the Argent@@ ine government .
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way that a ref@@ und@@ able deposit may be wai@@ ved for the issuing of the import license for the products in question .
it also stipul@@ ates that the responsible Argent@@ ine authority is informed of the quantities given to the competent authority of the Community at regular intervals for which export lic@@ ences have been granted ; this information may be en@@ forced upon country of destination if necessary .
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is du@@ ly applied and functioning smoothly .
he regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions in these markets , including the conditions set for the purpose mentioned under number 7 .
the Committee shall ensure that the proper use of this agreement is not affected by the fact that products made of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out according to the agreement not mentioned in the agreement .
the Committee disc@@ usses all questions arising from this agreement and recommends suitable solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount specified under number 2 applies to the period from 1 January to 31 December .
the amount applicable from the entry into force of this agreement until January 1 of the following year is determined in proportion to the total annual amount and takes account of the seasonal character of trade .
this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied and , on the one hand , the agreement on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at this point , it remains in force , subject to the right of each party to termin@@ ate it in writing within a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with you the consent of your government .
I honor you to confirm the receipt of your current letter with the following wording :

new Zealand guarantees compliance with the amounts specified in clause 2 in particular by giving no export lic@@ ences beyond these amounts .
the Community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the above @-@ mentioned products is made dependent on the presentation of an export license which is given by the notified body notified by the New Zealand Government .
the details of the application of this system are specified in such a way that a ref@@ und@@ able deposit may be wai@@ ved for the issuing of the import license for the products in question .

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Republic of Ö@@ st@@ lich of Uruguay concerning the trade with amm@@ el and lamb
I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are agreed as follows :
- Fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( collective bar@@ gaining rate 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ;
- Fro@@ zen H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat ( collective bar@@ gaining rate 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined by the Community on the following annual amount :
in order to ensure a perfect functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is obliged to ensure that the agreed quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and is carried out according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before introducing such a change in the Committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community adop@@ ts the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the Community market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the remainder of the year .
the Community is committed to limiting the exhaus@@ tion to imports of articles collected by this agreement to a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay will change the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of the Urugu@@ ay@@ an trade with each new Member State .
the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; here , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ inction of the exhaus@@ tion referred to under number 5 is taken into account .
the total amount known as number 2 is determined by the date of the accession of Greece to the Community on 5 800 tonnes of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an amm@@ el and lamb meat in the collective market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of prisoners of intervention on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed because of the implementation of the regulation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ sement or other promotion measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb meat as well as from slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs will only be given at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T , and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention concerning the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General In@@ dependence and Trade Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Uruguay ensures compliance with this agreement in particular by granting licenses for the products mentioned under the number 1 within this agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Community , in its turn , comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the above @-@ mentioned products is made dependent on the presentation of an export licence , which is given by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
it is also stipulated that the responsible ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ ic authority of the competent authority of the Community has notified the amounts in regular intervals for which export lic@@ ences have been granted ; this information may be en@@ forced upon country of destination if necessary .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand the agreement on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Ö@@ st@@ lich of Uruguay on the other .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; at this point , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing within a period of one year .
in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government with this letter .

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples which contain the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or other substance specified on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) har@@ mol@@ y@@ tic properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be investigated in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated solely by the volume of the blood vessel flus@@ hing in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object carriers , activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the determination of blood groups , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being elabor@@ ated .
according to definition , an international standard supplement contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the tit@@ ans observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most speci@@ fi@@ cities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the ti@@ ter specifies the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series , in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , available for the international standard preparations ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of unknown re@@ agent in international units ( See Bulletin who O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain according to definition 256 International units per ml .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory of Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of a comparison of the international standard serum anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should be maintained for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is closed in such a way that no moisture can penetrate .
a dry re@@ agent may not lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by additional drying via phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0,@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic is added to the agent ( or the solvents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) , provided that the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re @-@ dissolved serum .
re@@ agents , regardless of whether in fluid form or after re@@ opening , must be transparent and may not contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles .
the re@@ agents destined for the international exchange of blood groups should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement on a uniform system has come about .
re@@ agents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent located in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents provided are to be kept from the laboratory for a long time , until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
re@@ agents used for the determination of blood groups can contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to increase the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the agent .
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are classified according to the origin of their effective share in three groups .
this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or plant re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin .
on each container is a black and white printed label in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ circulation ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the amount or , in the case of dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ circulation ,
each con@@ sign@@ ment must be attached to this protocol according to Article 4 of the Convention .
