<seg id="725">The Community meets with the Organization of supplementary agreements necessary to determine the extent necessary for the successful and effective implementation of the tasks of the Organisation pursuant to this Convention, in detail how the procedures specified in the Convention shall apply.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be extended or modified without altering the agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously or as soon as possible after the entry into force of the Convention into force. the organization, the community and the states undertake every effort so that these agreements may enter into force within ninety days of the entry into force of the Convention; an extension of this period shall require the agreement between the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62, the Organization provides a summarized inventory of all the core material underlying the securing measures of this convention in the States, regardless of its origin, and carries on this inventory list as a result of the following reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organization (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG decided to contribute to the special action programme defined at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by universal resource transfer problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the goal of the EEC and the Member States that the total contribution made by Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement is bound and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bindings in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table which is purposely determined by the intended use of the criteria set out in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organization arranges a special account under the term "Special Account" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special transaction account in accordance with this Agreement; this account is referred to and used by the Organization as Administrator (hereinafter referred to as "Managing Director"), and only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The dues are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or incomparable bonds issued by the Member State to pay upon request in the currency of the relevant state to order the organisation as administrator of the transaction account and to deposit at the organisation in question in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment shall be made in two installments, and the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the caretaker at the agreed time;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the rest of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the Administrator taking into account the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may, upon request, make payments before the above dates.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the steward takes about proportional moves to the cash or the school jowl to cover the expenses for the transaction loan and to balance the transaction in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In granting this loan, the steward can be governed by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent that international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">(VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without disqualification; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) The extent to which the problems of the countries concerned are regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and quickly payable development program or project (including a sectoral project), regardless of whether it is considered, approved, approved and managed in accordance with the methods and practices used for the organisation financed by ordinary funding of the organization, taking into account the objective of the assumptions mentioned under letter b) of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the transaction may not be used instead of ordable funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organisation, which is tied to a programme or project in the context of a loan or loan that has already been approved by the Bank's Directors or the Organization on the day of entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same payback conditions, which generally apply to the development loans granted by the organization; therefore, they are refundable in ten free years each in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Transaction loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this tariff are directly to the organization that it reserves.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each transaction loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator, in particular the source of the funds is stated.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or used (ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a special transaction loan based on what the administrator has set at the time of the loan guarantee.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of transaction loans are made to the special transaction account, and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state shall be transferred back as soon as possible from the caretaker to the Member State concerned.</seg>
<seg id="753">Until full assignment of all special loans, the Administrator informs the EEC of the intentions and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of withdrawal of the transaction loan, the Administrator obliges the EEC quarterly on the development of the transaction loan and the expenses incurred for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="755">The Administrator obliges the EEC soon as possible after the end of the business year of the organization a detailed account of the transaction account with an opinion of the external auditor of the organization at this account end.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loan, the Administrator of the EEC soon conveys a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the transaction.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes suitable records and invoices from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid from the account receipts, the amounts paid to the account and deposits received from the account and the repayments to the Member States are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the stewards work closely together to achieve the aims of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the steward up to the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by the transaction, and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, the EEC and the Organisation may not enter into force, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting therefrom shall be due immediately.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of capital paid by the beneficiaries is withdrawn in accordance with Article II section 8 of this agreement and transferred back to the Member States, this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting therefrom shall be terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC according to the procedural provisions of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States note the exclusion of the proceedings concerned to the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities.</seg>
<seg id="764">The Secretariat forwards these notifications along with a notification about the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="765">This agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the named notifications in the organization.</seg>
