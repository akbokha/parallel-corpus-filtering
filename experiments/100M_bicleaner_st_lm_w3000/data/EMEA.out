it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. Zip thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and for the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
this affects signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to communicate with each other .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent , acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing its recur@@ r@@ ence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms was examined in three studies for up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar disorders that suffered from increased rest@@ lessness , over a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo .
in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and plac@@ ebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder caused by increased rest@@ lessness with the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in the patient &apos;s symptoms using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to inhal@@ e it .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness than the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than plac@@ ebo .
abili@@ fy also prevented more effective than 74 weeks as plac@@ ebo the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms of increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for inhal@@ ation ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disturbances ( un@@ controll@@ able tick ) , vom@@ iting , nausea , vom@@ iting , nausea , nausea , nausea , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes relate to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , compared to the risks .
in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the transport of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly had man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages of a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
taking into account the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results from an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that there was no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk in patients with bi@@ polar disorder compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be prescribed cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy are signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be removed .
therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased risk of death compared to plac@@ ebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic agents , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs that allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ or@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia as a result of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect , and may result in severe complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with over@@ bearing side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensive metabolism .
considering the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should be out@@ weigh@@ ed for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made .
after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram , or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , together with A@@ bili@@ fy , can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ or@@ phi@@ c / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( Var@@ min@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to insufficient data security for humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies in animals , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned that dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , should be operated until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of over 52 weeks , a total lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS , including par@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ ath@@ aller@@ ism , d@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % was plac@@ ebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was reported in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ ur@@ ap@@ ine therapy .
in a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
although no information on the efficacy of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis occurs in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma transmission .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic action on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in vitro , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 and 5@@ HT@@ A receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
with dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks on healthy subjects , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography revealed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ co@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on put@@ ty .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial , 52 percent of respon@@ der patients en@@ during a response to the study were similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than for hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole significantly reduced the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an Oscar @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superi@@ ority to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in two plac@@ ebo and actively controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy comparable to plac@@ ebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
furthermore , in week 12 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable share of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term exp@@ ul@@ sion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ path@@ y of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean el@@ min@@ ating age is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in extensive met@@ ab@@ ol@@ li@@ zation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and at approximately 146 hours at &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) met@@ ab@@ ol@@ li@@ zation via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy subjects , as did pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with no gender @-@ dependent effects .
a review @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal clin@@ ically significant differences regarding eth@@ ni@@ city eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy subjects .
one single dose survey in subjects with various liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the det@@ ri@@ ment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety and toxic@@ ity , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or expos@@ ures , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( which is 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in bile after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ x of the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the G@@ alle of apes in the study and are well below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ solu@@ bility .
these effects were observed in rab@@ bits after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ average steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic action on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
22 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term exp@@ ul@@ sion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .

the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia as a result of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may result in severe complications .

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a superi@@ ority to plac@@ ebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance is medi@@ ated via the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic action on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an Oscar @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 In a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against plac@@ ebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was compared to intake with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ max mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ gra@@ vation and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and start with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
in order to increase the absorption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if further oral treatment is indicated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy melting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for inclusion .
there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ gra@@ vation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were otherwise caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescri@@ bing or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be prescribed cau@@ ti@@ ously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease , con@@ ges@@ tion , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including active and malign@@ ant form ) .
L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ y and weakness should be observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteri@@ or@@ ating glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia as a result of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may result in severe complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was larger compared to that after a dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study where healthy subjects were administered intraven@@ ously in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) and who received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular at the same time .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid block@@ ers , decreases the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; met@@ abo@@ lic@@ ers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as i@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be made .
after placing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be increased to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were received intra@@ muscular , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after some administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % was plac@@ ebo .
in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trial , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % was for patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Plac@@ ebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include the malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution with statisti@@ cally significant increased improvement of ag@@ gra@@ vation / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gregation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of ag@@ gra@@ vation and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to plac@@ ebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference poor .
the observed mean improvement from the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for plac@@ ebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gregation , a similar activity was observed regarding the total population , but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients .
in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to plac@@ ebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients with a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) .
current values from measuring scales , which were defined as secondary objectives , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ as@@ berg @-@ depression rate scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than for hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decrease in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % under plac@@ ebo .
in an Oscar @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia for 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic features , which in part did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy for therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study program in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole prior to random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was superior to plac@@ ebo with regard to the prevention of bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , predominantly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger than the dosage of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the mean time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application .
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dose during systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times higher than the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following intraven@@ ous application there were no safety @-@ related concerns following mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the can@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data showed no particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans ; therefore , they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pigment @-@ accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at 60 mg / kg / day ( which is 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans ) .
in addition , ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was diagnosed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in bile after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1 to 3 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 @-@ fold of the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the middle steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dosage .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ anes was studied in a study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in any dose or as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
if one considers only those patients who have been treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the drugs in terms of the efficacy indicators , such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
in contrast , patients who previously had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
it may also not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients receiving the first treatment more effectively than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and that in contrast to other medicines containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Bio@@ Science Limited Company a permit for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine containing treatment is not indicated ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sens@@ orial neu@@ rop@@ athy during Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 during subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 , the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is reached to grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles , the dose must be reduced .
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were performed and there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of the kidney function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ artic@@ el formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el which could have much other pharmac@@ ological features than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately be removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el again .
in patients no repeated Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ l number has increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity has not been proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac events in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea occur in the patients after the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti @-@ eme@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ g@@ ating agents .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
women in child@@ bearing age should apply a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not produce a child during and up to six months after treatment .
male patients should be advised before the treatment via a sperm con@@ serving as the therapy with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible bar@@ r@@ enness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to serve machines .
the following are the most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , which were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported at 71 % of patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy for each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) .
occasional : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :
dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , blo@@ ating , tongue burns , dry mouth , painful g@@ ums , o@@ om@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract :
pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , sore muscles , discomfort in limbs , muscle weakness , very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an an@@ tim@@ icro@@ bial agent that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ bul@@ es and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ u@@ bar network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in im@@ parts the trans@@ ac@@ y@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ receptor and is a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumor due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( cream secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ anes for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm , non @-@ fa@@ un@@ al studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III comparative study .
in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , given an in@@ fusion of 175 mg / m2 in an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma over 30 minutes .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medication for prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study 64 % of patients had impaired general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received no chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % due to metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are outlined below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral Neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ie grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay on bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
the exposure to active substances ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous injection of Abra@@ x@@ anes to patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase manner .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular disper@@ sion and / or soft tissue binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study involving patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el &apos;s pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 m@@ g. / m2 of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration ( 43 % ) as after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is metaboli@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ anes in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ination of unchanged compounds was 4 % of the given total dose of less than 1 % of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clear@@ ance .
however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected against light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic an@@ tic@@ ar@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and , as in other potentially toxic substances , should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , it is inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle .
after complete addition of the solution , the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle should rest at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle should be slowly and carefully swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete res@@ us@@ sion@@ board of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itation or sp@@ ines are visible , the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle must be inver@@ ted gently to obtain a complete res@@ us@@ sion@@ board prior to application .
the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and the corresponding quantity of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market prior to the market launch will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging instructions . • Provi@@ de clear visual representation of the correct use of the product provided by patients .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same drug ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is used in patients with normal blood vessels , in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion if a blood donation is not possible prior to the procedure and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is to be expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make an own blood donation , Ab@@ sen@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to make sure there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ inal lack or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the effects of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that enables it to educ@@ ate epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference medicinal product when administered as an injection into a v@@ ein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected into a v@@ ein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to stre@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of stre@@ amed suction amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ at@@ amed were maintained to the same extent as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , the patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine @-@ like head@@ aches and confusion .
stre@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
fl@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that it does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for ab@@ se@@ amed in accordance with the European Union regulations it has been proven that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile , such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that manufactures ab@@ et@@ amed will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the marketing of ab@@ et@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tum@@ ours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ oma or multi@@ pl@@ ous my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general state ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ emia at the on@@ set of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , with planned larger operating procedures that require large blood volume ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
in order to reduce foreign blood , ab@@ se@@ amed may be applied before a major elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic procedure in adults without lack of iron in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 m@@ l. can not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / d@@ L ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and disease may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the doctor requires an assessment of the individual clinical course and disease status .
an increase in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in a patient above or below the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
in view of this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should try to reach the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the durable h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest permissible dose , which is required for control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low ho@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in whom initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
these clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low ho@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in whom initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
initial dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ emia and sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease . therefore , the doctor requires an assessment of the individual clinical course and disease status .
in view of this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should try to reach the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest permissible dose , which is required for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the cell count &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be sustained by 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week .
if the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled .
patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 @-@ 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood cann@@ ed foods is required , should receive ab@@ y@@ amed at a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the stre@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( Day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively be given 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients suffering from the treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin on er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive stre@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before treatment , inst@@ able ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ lies ) .
in patients fores@@ een for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , es@@ cor@@ t or underlying disease : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial disease , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported via the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased demand for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for a failure ( iron , fol@@ ate or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes ) , is lower ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ k@@ oc@@ yte numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an action loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be weigh@@ ed .
data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of stre@@ amed in patients with a risk of an antibody @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration , recommended in Section 4.2 .
in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ tile @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines when the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased over the concentration required for controlling the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should be around 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ dently cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart disease , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration , recommended in Section 4.2 .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia associated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 - 3 @-@ week lag between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ funded ) .
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ a@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
in patients who are intended for greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , before beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients who undergo greater elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive appropriate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it cannot be excluded that for treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic / vascular events can exist .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ chs did not prove that tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia will improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned when a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differences or prolifer@@ ation .
about th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral isch@@ em@@ ic attacks , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , ret@@ inas , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , including patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the wor@@ sen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ tic events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients treated with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically modified epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ zed and the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content are identical to the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
using cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa has specifically stimulated the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin demonstrated an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate than in the controls due to various common malign@@ an@@ cies .
overall survival in the studies could not be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results were transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of approximately 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after SC inj@@ ections , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved following intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first offering or 24 hours after the last administration .
bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with al@@ fa .

prior to the market launch and agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the holder of the marketing authorization must provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail pharmac@@ ies with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packaging instructions .
the holder of the authorization for the placing on the market must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and introduced in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application is functional before the drug is brought into circulation and as long as the drug is used in the traffic .
the holder of the authorization for the placing on the market under@@ takes to carry out the studies and additional measures for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , as outlined in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the application for authorisation , as well as the update of the Risk Management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
according to the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use , &quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • upon receipt of new information , which could have an impact on the safety specifications ( safety specification ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or the measures for risk reduction • within 60 days of reaching an important milestone ( the pharmaceutical vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • upon request by the E@@ MEA
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or enhanced chest pain ) , the risk of drop@@ let formation in the veins ( deep v@@ ein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) exists - for example , if such a blood @-@ crop has occurred before you , for example .
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral vascular disease ) , the neck vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ et@@ amed , there may be a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ e@@ ets within the normal range , which will reg@@ ain further treatment .
your doctor may , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets regularly during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 , or lack of fo@@ lic acid , should be taken into account and treated with stre@@ amed before starting therapy .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antibody @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ ema after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sting , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with ab@@ et@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , Ab@@ sen@@ amed must be given by injection into a v@@ ein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increases the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor may take into consideration an interruption of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney disease and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion through insufficient heart rate , your doctor will make sure that your ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency is not accelerated by the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet to be di@@ aly@@ sis .
a 2 - 3 week lag between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and the desired effect should be taken into consideration when ass@@ essing the efficacy of ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ es ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your dose of your dose to keep the risk of drop@@ let formation ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic event ) as low as possible .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully against the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are a cancer patient , remember that ab@@ se@@ amed acts as a growth factor for blood cells and , under certain circumstances , may have a negative impact on the tumour .
if you have a major orthop@@ edic surgery , ab@@ se@@ amed should examine the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia and treat it accordingly .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ es ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of bleeding after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicines .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means for supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice weekly , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg may be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after the operation .
however , if your doctor considers this appropriate , you can also learn how to spray ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , brain hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular extensions ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment .
ey@@ eli@@ ds and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke @-@ Ö@@ dem ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see the section called &quot; Special caution in the use of ab@@ et@@ amed &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can occur - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood @-@ graf@@ ting ( th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ) .
the treatment with ab@@ et@@ amed may be associated with an increased risk of blood c@@ logging after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic vascular events ) when your initial ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is too high

Ac@@ up@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who have recently suffered a low @-@ trau@@ matic stroke like the heart attack ; • Disease Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of the bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ last@@ a can reduce the symptoms of fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache during the three days after the in@@ fusion .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ span@@ a can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
since the active ingredient in Ac@@ span@@ a is the same as in z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate the ac@@ last@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved in oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , who had recently suffered a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ cu@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood normal@@ ised or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline value .
in the study with older women , the risk of spinal fluid frac@@ tures was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the plac@@ ebo patients .
the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % compared to patients with hyper@@ opor@@ osis ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment ) .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of the patients under Ac@@ up@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) versus 13 % of the patients under plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side effects of Ac@@ span@@ a occur within the first three days after the in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
it may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with acet@@ amin@@ osis are subject to the risk of kidney complaints , reactions to the in@@ fusion and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
the manufacturer of Ac@@ span@@ a provides clari@@ fication material for physicians who prescri@@ be ac@@ last@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis which contains information about how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited for the distribution of Ac@@ span@@ a throughout the European Union .

the Patient Information Package is to be provided and the following core messages include : • Comp@@ ensation in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D , adequate physical activity , non smoking and healthy eating • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When treating to medical or nursing aid
treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the ac@@ last@@ a in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ span@@ a should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Pa@@ get disease with ac@@ last@@ a , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first ac@@ up@@ a in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ span@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this patient group .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) It is not necessary to adjust the dosage as the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 , since data on safety and effectiveness are missing .
Ac@@ up@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ c@@ aly@@ sis is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of the treatment ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron lei@@ c acid on bone reconstruction , temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ thal@@ mia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ up@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient intake of calcium , corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of ac@@ last@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients who require dental interventions , no data is available , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the application of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of cases reported as severe side effects of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1,3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving plac@@ ebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ up@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
kidney function disorder Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which were referred to as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the change in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with acet@@ amin@@ A compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium levels below the normal range of fluctu@@ ation ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ span@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with acet@@ ab@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study , in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures following a recently frac@@ tured hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of acet@@ one ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions after the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been used , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) that were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ es .
7 study involving 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients showed oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with plac@@ ebo .
in the event of an over@@ dose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , a compensation can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ span@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density sword ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ Score for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ dog ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures of ac@@ last@@ a decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see table 2 ) .
patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ span@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ up@@ a increased bone density at lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the scar@@ let neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
oste@@ o@@ hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with acet@@ one ( N = 82 ) or plac@@ ebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the basin comb .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , a micro@@ comp@@ uted tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume compared to plac@@ ebo and the preservation of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture .
bone replacement markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pon@@ ti@@ d of the type @-@ I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients at intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Ac@@ up@@ a reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was maintained at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the BM@@ D increased the BM@@ D at all points of time compared to plac@@ ebo treatment .
compared to plac@@ ebo treatment , the ac@@ last@@ a treatment led to an increase in BM@@ D by 5.4 % compared to plac@@ ebo treatment and 4.3 % at the threshold .
clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients BM@@ D was assessed after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in acet@@ one @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of acet@@ one in comparison to the once weekly dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
clinical efficacy of the treatment in the disease of the bone Ac@@ last@@ a has been studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radi@@ ologically confirmed , above all light to moder@@ ately heavy disease Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase corresponding to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value when included in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months has been demonstrated in two six @-@ month comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison with the initial value for ac@@ last@@ a and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate after 6 months .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
of the 143 patients treated with acet@@ one and the 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , the therapeutic response was achieved in 141 patients treated with acet@@ yl@@ a compared to 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at during an average follow @-@ up of 18 months after the treatment .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of persistent in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma level rose rapidly to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a very low concentration of very low concentrations , no more than 0.1 % of the peak value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearance from the large circul@@ atory cycle with half @-@ life t ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β @-@ 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long el@@ min@@ ating phase with a terminal eli@@ oration period t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) presum@@ ably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption into the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion via the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clear@@ ance amounts to 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentrations against time ) .
a reduced Clear@@ ance of Met@@ ra@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , material @-@ alter@@ ing inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of C@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron A@@ ci@@ d cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction right down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the ci@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
since only limited data is available for severe kidney Dys@@ function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population .
the highest non @-@ Latvian intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C would be 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al tolerance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in rats was administered by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulative expos@@ ures exceeding the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects of other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection .
the most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hysi@@ se of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a findings that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , antioxidant action of the substance .
rats showed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was marked by 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and conditions before application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .

Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid is a substance of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens which are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , the bone structure is too fast , and new bone material is structured un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ up@@ a works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure again , ensuring normal bone formation and thus restoring strength to the bone .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with ac@@ last@@ a .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicines .
it is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ last@@ a together with food and drinks , be sure that you take sufficient fluids according to your doctor &apos;s instructions before and after the treatment with ac@@ last@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a v@@ ein .
since Ac@@ up@@ a works for a long time , you may need to take another dose after a year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood during the time after the in@@ fusion .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ last@@ a can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration is missed , contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before stopping the treatment with Ac@@ span@@ a Falls you are considering the completion of the treatment with Ac@@ span@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion frequently occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequent after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache appear within the first three days of the administration of Ac@@ last@@ a .
currently , it is unclear whether Ac@@ up@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received ac@@ last@@ a .

please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects significantly imp@@ airs or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this manual .
if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for storage time and conditions until application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are recommended to carry out the in@@ fusion of ac@@ last@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of acet@@ one , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid insertion of the effect of ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on bone structure a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ up@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of el@@ em@@ ental calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of ac@@ last@@ a .
patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture recommended an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D prior to the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one .

in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a suppor@@ tive agent in comparison to a plac@@ ebo .
on the other hand , the studies on the setting of smoking did not show consistent results , so that the effect of compli@@ a on this area of application was difficult to assess .

summary of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated . • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine ( dual therapy ) .
it can be used in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily set with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ p or insulin , the existing dosage of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops , enabling type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy and the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ p , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced when applying doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of an additional dosage of Ac@@ tos for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ p decreased by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional placement of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , patients with Ac@@ tos added to insulin , reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values from 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took plac@@ ebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thesia ( decreased sensitivity to irrit@@ ation ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other ingredients , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission granted the Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to appro@@ ve the transport of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is in@@ adequately adjusted with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
this study showed an increase in reports on heart failure , but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with elevated liver enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one cannot be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , tor@@ ch@@ iness , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been detected that can ag@@ itate from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention .
as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution a minor reduction of the mean ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction of 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients with met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3.1 % ) and insulin ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral two or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic res@@ p or as a dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
after the market launch , a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a .
it is unclear whether between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a there is a direct connection , but killing physicians should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological investigation should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .

patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is to be dis@@ continued ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % reduction in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T en@@ grav@@ ings of the three times the upper limit of the normal range appeared as frequently as under plac@@ ebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under plac@@ ebo if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the treated groups .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred .
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) ) , which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it was shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ stom@@ a versus mon@@ otherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time of two years after the treatment , a blood glucose control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar had been in@@ sufficiently dis@@ continued despite three months of optimization were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo .
in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decline of alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was tested in a small study of type 2 di@@ ab@@ etic patients in 18 weeks .
in most clinical studies , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol and a slight but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol level were observed in comparison to plac@@ ebo .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total plasma matri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ lin@@ ci@@ dal .
in comparison to plac@@ ebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was found under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while under met@@ form@@ in and g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide values decreased .
in a study of over 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride concentrations and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or plac@@ ebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the three @-@ fold effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in the barrels ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma el@@ min@@ ating age of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and that of the entire active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced ren@@ al function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar .
toxic@@ ological studies performed in mice , rats , dogs and apes following repeated dosing of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in- and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder was induced .
in an animal model of the famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a led to an increased frequency of col@@ onic tum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in were investigated with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in clinical trials more than 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decline in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine qu@@ oti@@ ents showed a statisti@@ cally significant decline in the output .
in a study of 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study was lacking in its primary end@@ point , a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation up@@ stream of the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not ent@@ ail cardiovascular long @-@ term risks .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin .
in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin .
ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package inserts ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane to the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a fast initial action is desired together with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
for example , patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by an intensified insulin therapy can change the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA in relation to insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in the dosage .
if a dosage adjustment is necessary when changing to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore consider potential interactions at the treatment and ask his patients for other medications taken from them .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es , and may end with temporary or permanent disturbances of brain function and even death .
nervous System Diseases - Periph@@ er@@ als neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement in blood sugar control can be associated with complaints which are called acute painful Neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 An intensi@@ fication of insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar setting can , however , be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of di@@ ab@@ etic retin@@ opathy .
skin and skin tissue diseases - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy On the injection site a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may arise when failed to replace the punc@@ ture points within the injection area .
general diseases and complaints at the site of surgery : local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma on the injection site ) .
diseases of the immune system Jel@@ ly - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions Sympt@@ oms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal upset , angi@@ onic e@@ dem@@ a , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can however develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
di@@ abe@@ tics should always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits , or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated by an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a reported aid or administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active time is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The res@@ or@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) localities on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety issues , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .
it is recommended - after the Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane gas bottle is removed from the refrigerator - increase the temperature of the insulin to room temperature ( not above 25 ° C ) before it is res@@ us@@ cit@@ ated in accordance with the manual for the first use .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from previous insulin .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of fast acting insulin must be raised , then the amount of the long acting insulin .
3 In case of change to Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient a dosage adjustment is required , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General diseases and complaints at the site of surgery : local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site during insulin therapy can occur local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( red@@ dening , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma on the injection site ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 di@@ ab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ di@@ ab@@ etic patients ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the effective maximum is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration amounts to approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was examined at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) of di@@ ab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
data is limited but suggests that pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : if you inj@@ ure too much insulin , if you eat too little or have a meal , if you are more physically demanding
always put the closing cap of your Nov@@ o@@ let ready p@@ ens always set up if it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Remove the sealing cap with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • always use a new injection needle for each injection to avoid contamination . • Remove the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ let ( figure A ) • Remove the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure a correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ let with the injection needle upwards • kno@@ ck lightly with your finger against the cartridge a couple of times .
if air bubbles are present , they will accum@@ ulate in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • Whi@@ le you continue to hold the injection needle further up , turn the cartridge in the direction of the arrow ( figure B ) • Whi@@ le the injection needle continues pointing upwards , press the push button in the whole ( Figure C ) • Now you have to squee@@ ze a drop of insulin from the head of the injection needle .
• Set the cap again on the ready @-@ made pen to indicate that the digit 0 is in relation to the dosing brand ( Figure D ) • Check if the push button is completely pressed .
if the push button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle . the scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the pus@@ h@@ button moves outside while you rotate the cap • The scale under the push button ( pus@@ h@@ button dial ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Note the highest number you can see on the pus@@ h@@ button scale • add the two numbers to get the set dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or reverse until you have set the correct number of units .
rotate it until the push button is completely down and you feel a resistance . then remove the cap and reset it so that the 0 of the dosing stamp is opposite .
make sure to press the pus@@ h@@ button only while inj@@ ecting , holding the button after injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin .
it may not be accurate • You can not set a dose higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual quantity scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you can not use it to stop or choose your dose .

aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already signs of de@@ bris , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or gi@@ g@@ ings ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger urine fragments which can lead to damage to joints and bones ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months , there may still be rheum@@ atism , which is why it is recommended that patients with Aden@@ ur@@ ic use other medicines for prevention of rheum@@ atism at least during the first six months .
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not examined for these groups .
in the first study , in which 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients participated , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the plac@@ ebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and by Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered 300 mg once a day in a dose ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the blood during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily had 120 mg of ur@@ ic acid in the last three measurements , a level of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver values .
particularly in patients with heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also harbor a higher risk of side effects related to heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine retention ( including one from the medical history of known or currently available rheum@@ atism and / or arthritis ) .
if the serv@@ om@@ ur@@ ic acid levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be considered on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents Sin@@ ce there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
organ transplan@@ t recipients Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , the treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other har@@ n@@ eli@@ an drugs , there may be acute emergency attacks during the course of treatment , because of the reduction of serum levels of serum urine acid deposits can first be mobili@@ zed in the tissues .
B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in the urine in rare cases may increase so far that there is a shift in the ur@@ inary tract .
during Phase 3 clinical studies slight changes in liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test before starting the bas@@ eline treatment and , depending on the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ ine did not carry out any interaction studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ ll level ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in the non @-@ static exposition ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without the need for a dose adjustment for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient applied at the same time .
in a study involving subjects , 120 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily treated an average 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an an@@ ta@@ zi@@ one containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminium hydro@@ xi@@ de delayed the absorption of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a reduction in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not cause side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not allow for direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be determined .
the risk factors identified in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could occur in the treatment arms of 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once were listed below .

ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and is produced in the context of the hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin reaction chain . → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) with a K@@ i @-@ value for the in vitro inhibit@@ or located below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX trial and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in each study where the last three monthly dosing levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with serum cre@@ atine lam@@ ination at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX @-@ study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared with the conventional dose Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cancer values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were group@@ ed together for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
lowering serum levels to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained permanently throughout the treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl were given 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( h . ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences regarding the percentage decrease of serum har@@ n@@ ac@@ ic acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum suppl@@ em@@ entation levels ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data from the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of serum urine was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a gi@@ ra@@ pp@@ ings in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against ra@@ pp@@ ings ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the poison , which results in 54 % of patients a complete dis@@ appearance of the top marks by month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose are propor@@ tionally proportional .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max amounts approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage decrease of serum har@@ n@@ aci@@ fication concentration was observed , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma protein binding of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ Glu@@ cur@@ on@@ oid is produced mainly by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , about 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , about 45 % of the dose was found in the chair as an unchanged F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ oid of the active substance ( 1 % ) , the well known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gates ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
after taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by around the 1.8 @-@ fold of 7.5 μ of the h / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ ( h / ml ) in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver @-@ function restriction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- u@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( child @-@ pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function .
age No significant changes were observed regarding the AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects .
carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase of ur@@ inary bladder tum@@ ours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , at about 11 times the exposure to humans .
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metaboli@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on the fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
at high doses , which were about 4.3 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity rose , which was accompanied by a reduction in breeding performance and a delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in bearing rats with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in bearing rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which amounted to about 13 times of the human therapeutic exposure , have no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in at the same time . * * In clinical trials , severe skin ras@@ hes or serious hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
in the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years were treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in each study where the last three monthly dosing levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data from the open extension study in phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum levels of serum urine was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients needed treatment against a gi@@ ra@@ pp@@ ings in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against ra@@ pp@@ ings ) .

in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble .
if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the crystal formation will be prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort can be achieved .
AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may not be taken , if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other components of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine , if you have a heart weakness or suffer from any other heart problem . • If you are treated with a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a row of cancer or the Les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare con@@ genital disorder where too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) .
if you have a po@@ ison@@ ous attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the attack is cleared before you start treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
this does not have to be the case with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , when you take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC .
your doctor will prescri@@ be you other medicines if necessary to treat a po@@ ison@@ ous attack or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicines .
it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking pharmaceuticals / using one of the following substances since interactions with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC may occur and your doctor may wish to consider necessary measures . • Mer@@ cap@@ top@@ urine ( for treating the immune system ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for blood di@@ lution in case of heart disease )
there were no studies on the effects of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC on traffic efficiency and the ability to operate machinery .
therefore , take AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from a intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not lie down until the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data derived from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) compared to those who exclusively received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are headache , muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal pain ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of es@@ oph@@ agus , dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , nas@@ al abdom@@ en ( b@@ lower abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic impact .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used in diseases of o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot sit or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd. for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; capsule @-@ shaped , white to broken white tablets , marked by the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot; &quot; &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal ble@@ ed@@ ings or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ la@@ sty ( see section 4.3 ) .
o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , el@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stro@@ kes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ ital@@ isation ) .
the doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malign@@ an@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to take out the medicine in the occurrence of symptoms of op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ie , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ red pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of serious bad @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
although there was no increased risk in large @-@ scale clinical studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and complications , were rarely reported ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men mainly administered intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available to give clu@@ es whether the use of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients with a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning for each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet the next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day .
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the absorption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
patients should therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at in clinical trials was taken together with a large number of commonly prescribed drugs without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for the use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by nursing women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at do not indicate directly damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports stem from cancer patients , but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , det@@ en@@ tions of serum @-@ calcium up to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with a similar incidence .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at &apos;s sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ om@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .
col@@ ec@@ al@@ ci@@ fer@@ ol ( vitamin D3 ) Vitamin D3 is produced in the skin by UV light via the transformation of 7 @-@ Deh@@ y@@ dro@@ ck to vitamin D3 .
the main effect of D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D3 is the increase in intestinal absorption of calcium and phosph@@ ate as well as regulating serum calcium , ren@@ al ex@@ cre@@ tion of calcium and phosph@@ ate , bone formation and bone res@@ or@@ ption .
in severe cases , a deficiency can lead to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia , weakness of the proxim@@ al muscul@@ ature and oste@@ om@@ al@@ acia and thus to a further increased risk of falls and frac@@ tures in oste@@ opor@@ otic individuals .

after 15 weeks of treatment , the mean serum levels of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D were significantly higher ( 26 % ) in the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) ( 56 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 23 ng / ml &#93; ) than in the group under Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at alone ( 46 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; 18,@@ 2 ng / ml &#93; ) .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 70 mg / 2,@@ 800 I.@@ U. ) significantly lowered the proportion of patients with vitamin D in@@ suffici@@ ency ( serum value of 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ pro@@ vitamin D &lt; 37@@ ,5 n@@ mo@@ l / l &#91; &lt; 15 ng / ml &#93; ) by 6@@ 2.5 % compared to Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 12 % vs ) .
the therapeutic balance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at once a week 70 mg ( n = 5@@ 19 ) and Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate 10 m@@ g. daily ( n = 370 ) was demonstrated in a one @-@ year multic@@ enter study in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis .
the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
in the phase III studies , the average asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 10 mg / day compared to plac@@ ebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % at fem@@ ur and 7.@@ 8 % at the Tro@@ chan@@ ter .
in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus plac@@ ebo 6.2 % ) was achieved in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D from the verteb@@ ral column and the Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials in which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new frac@@ ture rate by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus plac@@ ebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption Conc@@ ern@@ ing an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0,@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before accepting a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day .
in healthy subjects , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily for five days ) showed no clin@@ ically meaningful change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies on rats revealed that after IV dose of 1 mg / kg , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily spread in soft tissue , but then rapidly re@@ distributed to the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate about 50 % of the radio@@ actively tagged substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the barrels .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent the transplan@@ ted organ from being ej@@ ected by the immune system .
since Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already being used in the EU , the company presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was abor@@ ted after a year of treatment ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with adv@@ agra@@ ph , as the dose or the dose of the medication consumed at the same time has to be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clinical relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and daily dosage ; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after conversion .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure was comparable to both both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ Clear@@ ance substance , it can take several days to adjust the adv@@ agra@@ f dosage schedule until the steady state is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition is not permitted in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate to produce an in@@ fusion fluid ) with a dose of ca .
the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression has to be maintained to supp@@ ress the gra@@ ft rejection ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
recommended Dos@@ age - K@@ id@@ ney Transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later because the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should begin with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted a transplan@@ t recipients from twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of adv@@ agra@@ f , so this change@@ over has to be done in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
after switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t In adult patients who are switched to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily once in the morning .
in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for transplan@@ t recipients .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood @-@ tal@@ c@@ als in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function Sin@@ ce the kidney function does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine inspection , calculation of cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ in and monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f At the conversion from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the aid of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ mirrors @-@ checks .
it is recommended to carry out frequent monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood @-@ Tal@@ ks of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose @-@ adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the whole blood @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f is a drug with a low clearance , adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has entered .
the data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of the blood is not exceeding 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood is usually present in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and transplan@@ ted and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that may occur in a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus maintenance or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formula and daily dosage ; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ hed control of an experienced physician ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and gra@@ ft recipients , no clinical data is yet available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to potential interactions leading to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood and weak@@ ening the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies is avoided during a treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases pro@@ gra@@ f was a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy referred to as aqu@@ eous or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid excess and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malign@@ ant skin l@@ esi@@ ons by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective agent with a high protection factor .
if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disorders , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
as Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption are recommended .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , raise or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A &apos;s metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dosage accordingly ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly pronounced interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ co@@ tics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , i@@ ra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the macro@@ li@@ de antibiotic er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of Ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase the hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious in decisions regarding contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any det@@ ri@@ mental effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ kal@@ emia of new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not exactly determined because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
subsequently , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .

cases of B@@ Cs @-@ Virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant tum@@ ours including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
active mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be conveyed through its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus inhi@@ bits the activation of T cells and the prolifer@@ ation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ k@@ ines ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .
12 confirmed acute re@@ pul@@ sion was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks of the Adv@@ agra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and 29.@@ 3 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) .
patient survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 males ) and 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) were killed in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm .
kidney transplantation The effectiveness and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared in combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ olate mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients .
patient survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 7.5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 males ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f @-@ Arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were killed .

the incidence of treatment failure after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft rejection , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Adv@@ agra@@ f group ( N = 212 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( N = 212 ) .
the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.@@ 2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .

published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ tations Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant for pancre@@ atic , pul@@ mon@@ ary and intestinal transplan@@ tations .
175 lung transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplantation and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f revealed in these published studies the observations in the large studies where pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent , multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after a year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the case of patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the incidence of a Bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans occurred in 21.@@ 7 % compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients being converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute gra@@ ft rejection was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi @-@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out in 205 patients undergoing a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ised Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) procedure .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on the 5th .
in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver and intest@@ ine and 25 mul@@ tiv@@ is@@ zer@@ al gra@@ fts ) under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one , the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric clinical trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .
methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlargement , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist dac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , leading to seb@@ um mirr@@ oring between 10 and 15 ng / ml and recent transplantation ( An@@ n Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 4@@ 04 ) .
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound faction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation .
this can be concluded that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs across the bile .
in stable patients , which were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once daily ) in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to carry out frequent monitoring of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data available for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid excess and o@@ e@@ dem@@ a .
28 confirmed acu@@ ities in the first 24 weeks of the Adv@@ agra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) were 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

Adv@@ oc@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( one caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II related , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether it is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced into the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but it is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages in 86 % of 510 new blood grades with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common adverse events of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VI@@ II .
advoc@@ ates may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the placing on the market of Adv@@ oc@@ ates throughout the European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of treatment , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections are advised to determine the factor VI@@ II plasma level in order to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to Factor VI@@ II , achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value periods .
3 pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. by factor VI@@ II per kg body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be performed to detect an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the Factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the transfer speed should depend on the patient &apos;s condition , where a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against Factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity by factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma by means of modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of Factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
the A@@ DR@@ s performed in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors of Factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of whom were previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rarely &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - and the Clear@@ ance rate demonstrated adequate levels again on the 15 day postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , none of the 53 pedi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate Hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) was observed after prior exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or .
in previously untreated patients undergoing ongoing clinical study , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend and an ongoing peak of the antibody @-@ antibody against anti @-@ CH@@ O @-@ cell proteins , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred that were indic@@ ative of an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a co@@ op@@ actor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated factor X by factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( base value of Factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters stem from a cross @-@ over study with A@@ DV@@ ATE in 100 previously treated patients equal or &gt; 10 years and are listed in table 3 below .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , based on the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided that the authorisation holder must apply for another extension procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ drew its application for approval for the application of Adv@@ enti@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , breast , brain , bones or soft tissues ( tissues that connect , surround and support other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus , genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ enti@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ection would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ours and thus enable cancer cells to reg@@ ain the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the p@@ 53 gene that is not defective in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can grow and share .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer stood in the abdominal area , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP examined the answers of the company to the questions he asked , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP created a list of questions sent to the company by day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ enti@@ in inj@@ ections in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore bring benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company has not adequately proven that adv@@ ection can be established in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not inform CH@@ MP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programmes with Adv@@ enti@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; modified active ingredients &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to poll@@ en ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and young people from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ ol is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) are cl@@ oned .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy dimensions were the changes in the sever@@ ity of ha@@ y fever , reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all ha@@ y fever symptoms other than the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , the patients reported that the a@@ ero received a decrease in the symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who took pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % versus 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who lost Des@@ cent &apos;s adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart hunting ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ os@@ ol may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for treating allergies ) .
aer@@ os@@ ol may also not be used in patients suffering from narrow angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular diseases including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension of the thy@@ roid ) or have a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the placing on the market of aer@@ os@@ ins across the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without t@@ ear@@ ing it , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) , Aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy if necessary .
since aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ con@@ junc@@ tiv@@ a , which can be performed per@@ oral or nas@@ ally as ab@@ ov@@ els of r@@ hin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ ol@@ olin etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data do not suff@@ ice to address the appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ os@@ ins were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that the treatment must be reduced in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , caution is advised : • Pati@@ ents with heart rhythm disorders • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests because anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce it to their extent .
in the course of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
in the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test , no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with plac@@ ebo and plac@@ ebo , regardless of whether or not that lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 does not inhi@@ bit Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , resulted in no increase in the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
because reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness , which may imp@@ air traffic imper@@ me@@ ability or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , reduced mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory failure , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ menstru@@ al pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as atro@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in a single dose survey with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage may cause other sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S exc@@ itation .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , 4@@ 14 patients received aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets in terms of the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets did not show significant differences with regard to patient sub@@ sets defined by gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of an individual dose survey on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ os@@ ol , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can be detected within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ os@@ ins in healthy subjects over 14 days , the body weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ Hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study , which was conducted using the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were badly metaboli@@ sed of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional safety studies , toxic@@ ity of repeated doses , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with deser@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n however does not reveal any particular danger to humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application for authorisation , Pharma@@ ko@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines help allevi@@ ate the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , to un@@ fold its effect .
aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever ) , such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and so@@ othing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cous membrane of the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine .
( diabetes ) , a sten@@ o@@ zing stomach ul@@ cer ( which leads to nar@@ rowing of the stomach , the small intest@@ ine or the es@@ oph@@ agus ) , a closure of the stomach outlet or the du@@ oden@@ um ( intestinal ob@@ struction ) , a pro@@ static enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder .
tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or illnesses under the use of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze : • Blood pressure • Hear@@ ts , pal@@ pit@@ ations • Car@@ di@@ ac disease • nausea and head@@ aches , or a strengthening of existing head@@ aches .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription medicines .

after the launch of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes were reported .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart @-@ hunting , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , in@@ som@@ nia with increased physical activity , over cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml @-@ solution for intake .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or 5 mg .
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ rats , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to inhal@@ e and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is harmless .
in case of an allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average reduction of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a plac@@ ebo .
in the two studies with ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared with 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union .
one tablet daily , with one or without a meal , to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical studies on efficacy in the use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the current clinical course and can be terminated following the sever@@ ity of the symptoms and resum@@ ing their recovery .
pers@@ ist allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in di@@ zz@@ iness , which may imp@@ air traffic imper@@ me@@ ability or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the most commonly reported adverse events reported as reported in plac@@ ebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and at 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose survey of up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
this includes in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as inhibit@@ ing the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ Selec@@ tin to endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
in the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was observed .
in a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on duration of symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown by the World Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire on Quality of Life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria has been investigated in the form of other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of eti@@ ology , is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be random@@ ly recru@@ ited .
as hist@@ amine irrit@@ ation is a cause of all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that , apart from chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria may lead to an improvement in the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rats at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the study excluded the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines .
improving it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced sleep and w@@ aking distur@@ b@@ ance , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded .
in vivo did not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dosage of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ ory rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with deser@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on conventional studies on safety issues , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with deser@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data that support a treatment of an infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ se des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience a higher endurance strain ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are metabolic .
this drug contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol has not increased the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup group as in the plac@@ ebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than those treated with plac@@ ebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose survey of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dosage ) .
children between 1 and 11 years of age who came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ am@@ therapy were given a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in@@ dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the progression of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
in a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study involving adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval appeared .
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
with an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials showed no impair@@ ment of psych@@ om@@ otor functions .
in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of the alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor an increase in som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively reducing the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ rats at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restricted metabolism phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater than black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose survey with the sy@@ rup formulation of children aged 2 to 11 with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications for clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 Sever@@ al single dose studies showed that AU@@ C and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us Si@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ in@@ bottles with child @-@ proof polypropylene closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

take a dose of A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate once a day to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
immediately before applying , the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate must be removed without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with plac@@ ebo .
in a multi @-@ dose survey , where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine times clinical dose ) were applied , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed .
in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data .
in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval appeared .
in controlled clinical studies , there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
in a 17 single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as s@@ ne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal flow and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as shown by the World Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire on Quality of Life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

there is limited experience in clinical studies on efficacy in the use of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
before applying , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the tablet is removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the plac@@ ebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us M@@ elt tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate as a nar@@ co@@ sis of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in single dose @-@ crossover trials of A@@ eri@@ us M@@ elt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for intake , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients , but in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets supports the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which are fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are metabolic .
this drug contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ ch@@ ase is@@ om@@ alt@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the plac@@ ebo group in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group .
in infants aged 6 to 23 months , the most commonly reported adverse events reported as reported in plac@@ ebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.7 % ) , fever ( 2.3 % ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( 2,3 % ) .
in an additional study , no side effects were observed in patients aged 6 to 11 at a one @-@ time dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
in the recommended dos@@ ages , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in the children &apos;s and adult population .
in controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively be present in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of symptoms .
as shown on the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively reducing the strain caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .

in June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. announced the approval of the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company with@@ drew its application for approval for the distribution of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new trunk of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person because people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the parts of the flu virus in the vaccine as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and makes antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the immune system will later be able to produce antibodies in contact with a flu virus .
subsequently , the membrane of the virus was cleaned up with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a foreign body ) , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a survey of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good clinical practice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( G@@ CP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for ass@@ essing the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
should you take part in a clinical trial and require further information regarding your treatment , please contact your attending physician .
if you would like further information regarding the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken along with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines the patient had previously taken and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines .
for children from 4 to 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
aids cannot cure AIDS , but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other an@@ tivi@@ ral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug as@@ gener@@ ase enhanced with low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( virus load ) or the viral load alteration after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml as under plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few to the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase reinforced the viral load after 16 @-@ weeks treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the viral load combined with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r decreased after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gro@@ asis ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase can also not be used in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are broken down just like as@@ gener@@ a and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( alterations in body fat distribution ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the self @-@ healing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase prevailed in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children aged over four years compared to the risks .
as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the use of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally registered under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited Company for marketing authorisation in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
typically A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
2 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules are used without the enhancing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ a in combination with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on the safety and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use should be noted in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) .
as@@ gener@@ ase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and may also represent substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ therapy 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
plant preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r during the intake of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ a or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gro@@ asis does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver damage with potentially fatal outcome .
in case of simultaneous an@@ tivi@@ ral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with previously reduced liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased incidence of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of as@@ gener@@ ase and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ag@@ ro@@ atin with lov@@ ast@@ atin and simp@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under Monitoring the International Reg@@ ent R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
in patients taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ate content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be treated with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the incidence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exac@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases which were required for therapy that were associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis are reported .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections , leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although a multi@@ fac@@ torial eti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also present substrates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ therapy 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs whose active substances are mainly metaboli@@ sed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , undesi@@ rable effects on the liver were observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be brought low by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ x mirror and , if possible , check the virus load and susp@@ end the St. John &apos;s wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand , reduced by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , doses of 600 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were twice daily and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme .
52 % lower if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study on the use of asthma in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but because of the an@@ ta@@ d component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that the in@@ comes of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and as@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , dosage adjustment is not necessary .
treatment with ov@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeu@@ tical plasma level .
when used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
simultaneous injection of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in side effects associated with Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in doses of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin in combination with er@@ y@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin have not been performed , but the plasma levels of both pharmaceuticals may be increased in case of simultaneous administration .
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole with 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may , if used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , may lead to interactions .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines when used in combination with A@@ gro@@ asis .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids should not be taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ a as it may result in absorption problems .
simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ des is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is highly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected with simultaneous administration of A@@ gro@@ asis .
since plasma levels of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these drugs with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended .
it is recommended that the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous application of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used along with or@@ ally recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while the use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution is advisable .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ kin@@ ase inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3 to 4 @-@ fa@@ che .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for op@@ pi@@ ate symptoms , especially if low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the am@@ on@@ avi@@ r dose if amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r is given at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gro@@ asis , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ent R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of a@@ gener@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ t@@ ating rats , amp@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ on@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding .
further development of seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of amp@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
the side effects associated with as@@ gener@@ ase treatment were mild to moderate , appeared early and rarely lead to treatment failure .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ a or another drug used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1,@@ 200 m@@ g. of as@@ gener@@ a twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ ther@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ cal fat accumulation ( bull racks ) .
113 anti @-@ vir@@ ally non @-@ treated individuals who had been treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks was only observed one case ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the Pro@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s presented 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 eyes ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients with in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
rash usually were mild to moder@@ ately pronounced , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or macro@@ por@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually disappeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be abor@@ ted with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) may develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of patients receiving 600 mg of as@@ gener@@ a twice a day together with low dose rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable to those observed under some gener@@ at@@ ase treatment ; one exception was the increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride and CP@@ K values , which were very common in patients who received ast@@ er@@ ase along with low doses of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe indications of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the 50 % inhi@@ bin concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is found in the range of 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0,@@ 08 µ@@ M in the case of acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the relationship between the activity of amp@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as in other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ kin@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations were rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral non @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to 48 weeks , with 14 isol@@ ates being gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within 59 patients who had not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day : n = 107 ) of patients treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors occurred over 96 weeks following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based analyses of gen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ A / C / F / M , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M .
conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended that the current interpretation systems are always used to analyze the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four , with reduced sensitivity to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ us@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not @-@ treated patients , in whom a suscep@@ ti@@ bility to suscep@@ ti@@ bility failed ( one of which showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the beginning of treatment and another against Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits , which can have a det@@ ri@@ mental effect on subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study where PI pre@@ treated with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ lined shaft of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of oo@@ ster@@ oid drugs is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was examined twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients en@@ rolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the therapy optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the average duration ( T@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand , reduced by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decline of the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosing ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous dietary intake influenced the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active agent in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing interval dependent on the total drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , medicines that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered with caution when given with caution when given at the same time ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , results in a similar daily amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those in healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneously minist@@ ering Rit@@ on avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ omas used in male animals occurred in dos@@ ages which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ at@@ oc@@ ell@@ ular Aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application , there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of in vitro and in @-@ vitro gene toxic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , was not mut@@ agen@@ ic or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical trials , either during administration or after treatment .
toxic@@ ity studies of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and with the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
systemic plasma @-@ exposure , significantly below ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus @-@ prolon@@ gation and minor skel@@ etal changes that indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ a capsules are used without the enhancing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 20 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be noted with caution in patients with mild or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under Monitoring the International Reg@@ ent R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be de@@ activated in the course of 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand , reduced by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved with the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with cal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ et@@ ra may not be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with ov@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
when used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as accurate predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult for Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in doses of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this purpose .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , may increase the activity and toxic@@ ity of these drugs .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days to subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
with simultaneous application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants together with A@@ gro@@ asis , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ent R@@ atio ) is recommended due to the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bo@@ tic effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to an acceptance of the AU@@ C and C@@ min of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r by 22 % or respectively .
this medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the potential benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , which was given am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the em@@ bedding in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in body weight during breast@@ feeding .
the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in case of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe indications of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the an@@ tivi@@ ral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was examined both on acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % inhi@@ bin concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is found in the range between 0.0@@ 12 and 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in the case of acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
conver@@ sely , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant insul@@ ates ; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on these data , the expected benefits of &quot; untreated &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the therapy optimisation of children treated with PI .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active component fluctu@@ ates during dosing interval dependent on the total drug concentration in the ste@@ ady state via the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .

toxic@@ ity studies of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and with the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the met@@ ab@@ norm@@ alities are not yet fully mature , so that amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years of age .
the benefit of using k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution was neither treated in patients treated with PI nor treated with PI .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % lower than the capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es and solution are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should , once they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , stop taking the solution to intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase Solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution to intake and low dos@@ ed rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dose adjustment for am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in patients with ren@@ al failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col@@ ate , A@@ gener@@ ase is a solution to take in infants and children under the age of 4 , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .

patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ at@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gro@@ asis does not prevent risk of 47 any transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under Monitoring the International Reg@@ ent R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration .

in hem@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports about an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ rho@@ sis are reported .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max on the other hand , reduced by 30 % if rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is unknown . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , A@@ gener@@ ase can not be used during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) .

the harm@@ lessness of A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs .
in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are associated with taking A@@ gener@@ a or another drug used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease .

application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated . • In case of case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is administered three times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment courses .
before bed@@ time , apply the cream to the affected skin areas , so that they remain on the skin sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) before they are washed off .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a plac@@ ebo ( the same cream , but without the drug ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the plac@@ ebo were treated either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the plac@@ ebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the complete recovery rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with plac@@ ebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete recovery rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the plac@@ ebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

apply Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues to continue until all visible tendencies in the genital or peri@@ anal area have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
interruption in the treatment course described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated l@@ esi@@ ons are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan .
apply i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed skin area infected with pasta until the cream is fully covered .
it should take place in these patients between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction .
in other studies where no daily occurrence was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with a s@@ nar@@ ration leading to circumcision .
when applying i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ation was observed , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or caused temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , necess@@ it@@ ating emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has been applied to the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream directly after treatment with other cut@@ an@@ ally applied methods for the treatment of external suitability in the genital and peri@@ anal areas .
although limited data indicate an increased rate of bias in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the residual ni@@ p@@ ples .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line has not been studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions atro@@ phy after treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or the sever@@ ity of the local skin reactions , a treatment period of several days may be made .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment are currently available , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered for super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and untreated BC@@ Cs . therefore , the application of previously untreated tum@@ ors is not recommended .
data from an open clinical study suggest that large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7,@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) are less likely to respond to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip .
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions tend to decrease in intensity during the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong in the patient , the treatment may be suspended for a few days .
the data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 acc@@ esi@@ ons reported lower recovery rates than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) were not quanti@@ fied either once or after several times of top@@ ical use , no recommendation can be given to the application during breast@@ feeding .
the most frequently communicated and possibly linked to the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection with side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of the ap@@ titude ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and prob@@ able or possibly related side effects associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream are complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by Phase III of the Phase III plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream are shown below .
the most common , prob@@ able or possibly associated side effects associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical studies with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream were listed below .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided by the test plan shows that in these plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream frequently to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / di@@ pping / sli@@ pping ( 23 % ) and Ö@@ dem ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) .
the evaluation of clinical signs provided by the study suggests that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine @-@ cream , severe erosion ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe sh@@ edding and ru@@ sting ( 19 % ) occurred .
in clinical trials investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine for the treatment of ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental oral admission of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically most severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg was hyp@@ ot@@ onic that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluids .
according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigations .
3 efficacy studies were shown in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the efficacy is significantly superior to a complete recovery of the suitability in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine treatment over 16 weeks of a plac@@ ebo treatment .
in 60 % of the patients who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od the F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen cured completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo ( 95 % CI ) :
complete healing was achieved at 23 % of 157 male patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od versus 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data obtained from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically healed and that remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine at three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic nude l@@ esi@@ ons within a coher@@ ent 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications External F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma generally do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages examined there ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal systemic intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three times weekly application for 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 p@@ ou@@ ches ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 p@@ ou@@ ches ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study , which indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low after top@@ ical application on MC @-@ sick skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rats , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study on the der@@ mal application carried out for four months did not show any similar effects .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours in the application .
the appropriate mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for the human being to look very low due to systemic exposure .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following are not neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I : enlarged liver , stiff joints which complic@@ ate movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye disease .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be administered in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction .

in the study , the safety of the drug was investigated , but its effectiveness was measured ( by examining its effect in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , pain , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion .
very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measure of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and shi@@ vers .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergic ) to the lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review every year all new information that may be known , and where necessary update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in terms of the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. authorization to transport Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA @-@ technology using CH@@ O M@@ amm@@ am@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Eg@@ g of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should be done by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effects occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ alization devices are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that nearly all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a prolonged period of interruption , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions must be cau@@ ti@@ ously avoided following an interruption of treatment .
60 minutes before starting in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the event of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment should be considered with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or reduce the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
in case of a single severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction has occurred .
3 ) ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies are not attributable to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ born babies exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during treatment .
adverse events in clinical trials were primarily classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions also occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing down@@ time and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ desirable Drug Inter@@ action in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe trial form and duration of treatment up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a serum @-@ version was performed within 3 months of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of 5 years with a more severe exp@@ ir@@ ation form usually came into a serum @-@ version within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older ) .
by the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no evidence of radio@@ immun@@ op@@ lec@@ turing ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients with whom it had never been released .
patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG @-@ mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined .
four patients ( three in the Phase III study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
the presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even if adverse drug reactions were typically associated with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for enz@@ ym@@ atic replacement therapy lies in one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ ata and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of enzyme activity .
following intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were investigated in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 @-@ 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of the patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week .
after 26 weeks of therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and mobility compared to the plac@@ ebo group , which is shown in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as highlighted in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the growing size of children .
of the 26 patients with H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease in the G@@ AG mirrors in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
there was general improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe trial form and 4 with the middle course of the course ) .
in four patients the dosage increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 .
in several patients a growth rate ( n = 7 ) and weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe trial form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the middle course form had a normal mental development speed whereas only limited or no progress was observed in the cognitive development in older patients .
in a phase 4 study , investigations were carried out on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms dosing schemes on the G@@ AG @-@ level in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be a substitute alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information available annually , and if required , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of patients suffering from older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety issues , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans .
since no compatibility studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines except those listed below .
if the ready @-@ to @-@ use preparation is not immediately used , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8@@ º C , provided th@@ inning was done under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .

the holder of the authorization for the placing on the market has completed the following program of studies within the given time , whose results are the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme named α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in small amounts , or this enzyme is completely absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you are taking pharmaceuticals that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a reduced effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have taken it recently , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion fluid must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for the intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical specialists ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , gradually increase every 15 minutes to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions oc@@ cured , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing down@@ time and facial oils .
very common ( occurrence in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • Head@@ ache , nausea , abdominal pain • rash • Joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Elev@@ ated fever • Elev@@ ated pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action to the in@@ fusion

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Det@@ er@@ mining the number of bottles to be dil@@ uted according to the body weight of the individual patient .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body ) . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer that does not attack the plate epitheli@@ al cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , the patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid and fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is given together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent fluid deficiency ) should be given before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood count changes , or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , de@@ posed or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed slow@@ s down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells .
for the treatment of malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study involving 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months with the exclusive administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell count significantly longer than with the comparison drug during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. to promote the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union .
each bottle must be dissolved with a supplement of 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predominantly PC@@ O epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with either a lo@@ at@@ ally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer except for predomin@@ ant re@@ ticle epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completing the tel@@ emet@@ ric in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle .
in order to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of tel@@ emet@@ ry , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last dose of tel@@ emet@@ ry .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) a week before the first dose of tel@@ emet@@ ry and after each third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving tel@@ emet@@ ry , a full blood count should be created before every application , including a differentiation of leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and plat@@ el@@ et counting .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose @-@ examination must take place taking into account the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood @-@ picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the anticipated therapeutic cycles .
after recovery patients have to be further treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that are applicable to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria are the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment .
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be stopped if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- an ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above , in comparison with patients at the age of 65 , there is an increased side effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose @-@ adjustment was necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; to the 3,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( with metast@@ ases of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored with respect to bone mar@@ gar@@ n@@ esis and can not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ l count exceeds a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ l number , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous cycles of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in the degree of 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was ignored if pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to moderate ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous use of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients with a tel@@ emet@@ ric therapy need to avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs at least 5 days prior to the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the incidence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
for patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid retention in the trans@@ cellular space a drainage of the eff@@ usion before the P@@ emet@@ ric Mi@@ xed Treatment is to be considered .
5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with P@@ emet@@ rit@@ ters if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability by means of p@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised before the treatment man@@ t to seek advice regarding the sperm con@@ serving .
in patients with normal kidney function ( kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ is@@ tika ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) lead to a reduced breakdown of side effects .
caution is advisable when high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function ( kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ ticle should be avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data concerning the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs are available with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with P@@ emet@@ rit@@ ters must be avoided at least 5 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with P@@ emet@@ re@@ - mixed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ent R@@ atio ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of tel@@ emet@@ ry mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - acid an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy .
it should not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to p@@ emet@@ ry , men should be advised before the treatment begins to seek advice regarding the sperm con@@ served .
it is not known whether P@@ emet@@ ry mixed into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
common side effects : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontaneous reports not inv@@ alu@@ able ) .

in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti @-@ fol@@ ate with several targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ at@@ re@@ duk@@ t@@ ase ( DH@@ FR ) and gly@@ c@@ ami@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ d@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ ul@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin at chem@@ on@@ ai@@ al patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural lam@@ ide showed that patients with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically meaningful advantage over medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month @-@ long survival compared to those patients who were treated only with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) in relation to the common c@@ is@@ pl@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the difference between the two arms was improved by improving lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ized , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic N@@ SC@@ LC was treated with patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with N@@ SC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1,@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separately random@@ ized , controlled Phase 3 study showed that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for tel@@ emet@@ ry between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination opposite gem@@ cit@@ abine , c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( matched HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 94 - 1.@@ 15 ) , the overall response rate was 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1.4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine , c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of N@@ SC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy , with an overall confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ under@@ age limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ ins ( p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3,@@ 1 % versus 6.2 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tum@@ ours in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed as a mono@@ therapeu@@ tical agent were evaluated in doses of 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fu@@ sions .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose is found in the urine within 24 hours after application .
a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs that had received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ im@@ ular changes were observed ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ al epitheli@@ al tissue ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with a low @-@ calorie , fat @-@ reduced diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are ham@@ mer@@ ed , they cannot break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats led by food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed in the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with plac@@ ebo .
in both studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg , compared to 2.3 kg when taking plac@@ ebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss for patients could be observed .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stage finish , stu@@ d@@ iness , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it should not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines like war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( which does not contain enough nutrients from the digestive tract ) or suffer from cholesterol ( liver disease ) , and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited Company for placing or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight ( body mass index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since or@@ list@@ at is only reduced to a minimum , it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pri@@ mary child@@ birth ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich individual meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , as the dosage of the anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic should be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
when using War@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally standardised ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K , as well as beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ins , remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement prior to sleeping to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a minor decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological properties of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) .
the incidence of adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown , as these events were reported voluntarily by a population of in@@ definite magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to di@@ lem@@ mas with regard to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
in the majority of cases reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosing , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on research on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by the lip@@ id properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect begins in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ atic li@@ pi@@ a .
clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the food fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ oric , fat @-@ reduced diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to bas@@ eline ( at the time of random@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies , the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline : 5,@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average am@@ per@@ age of LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and plac@@ ebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference , the average am@@ per@@ age was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.7 cm ) and plac@@ ebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measured 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
in general , no @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adic@@ ally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study with adi@@ p@@ ous patients whose minimal systemic res@@ or@@ ted dose was administered , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ shaped leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing nearly 42 % of total plasma concentrations .
based on conventional studies on safety issues , toxic@@ ity with repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any special danger to humans .

the most common side effects are related to the mode of action of the capsules and are caused by the fact that more fat is ex@@ cre@@ ted from the body .
these side effects generally occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may have not reduced the fat percentage of your diet consequently .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional benefits : • Beg@@ in for a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a reduced fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended amount of fat evenly on daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take per meal , not to take it in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a rich supplementary table as you might have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in whom these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of the reach of children in@@ accessible . • Do not use any more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box . • Store firmly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two sealed sealed tanks with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

al@@ oh@@ xi is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) and chem@@ o@@ therapies , the excessive trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti @-@ eme@@ tics ) .
the use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the drug inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the gut .
in three main studies Alo@@ xi was examined on 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chemotherapy regi@@ mens , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Aloe showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chemotherapy regi@@ mens , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with al@@ chem@@ a showed no vom@@ iting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 out of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Bio@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
al@@ op@@ ia is indicated for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in case of strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of al@@ op@@ ia for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
because pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or that tend to be an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , al@@ oh@@ xi is not intended to be used to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in the days after chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics tested against tum@@ ors ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a steady @-@ st@@ ate@@ - concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( an@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , cervi@@ cal , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience on the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micro@@ grams were reported side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with al@@ op@@ ia , headache ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing experiences .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effects to observe .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were performed because of the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for al@@ op@@ ic over@@ dosing .
in two random@@ ised double blind studies a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given that was given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and dac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients given intraven@@ ously at Day 1 .
results of trials with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the capacity to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential .
the objective of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in individual doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average temporal half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ / kg in both healthy and cancer patients .
according to IV administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration between day 1 and day 5 was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron reached 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was equivalent to a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured value ; however , the C@@ max was higher after the entry of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites which , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in @-@ vitro studies on the metabolism demonstrated that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the enzyme enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 mc@@ g / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as unchanged compound made about 40 % of the given dose .
in 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min , the total body size was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination diet and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient for the maximum human@@ istic exposure , indicating low relevance for clinical use .
10 From prec@@ lin@@ ical studies indications are indications that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ions in very high concentrations which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization , and can pro@@ long the amount of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , resulted in increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine Ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al glands ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans .
the holder of this authorization for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing on the market of the medicine approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon is to resem@@ ble a biological medicinal product called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has suffered damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ normally increased .
a yeast is produced in which a gene ( DNA ) has been introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( drug structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : email @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int / / or distribution of this document is Auth@@ or@@ ised for non business purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed do not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients responding to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in the clinical trial .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference medicinal product ; Al@@ ph@@ eon also had more side effects .
apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug causes an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not adequately vali@@ dated .
it can be used for the treatment of Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected fir@@ ings ( crack or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ched wounds .
al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections caused or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ t @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not work against these kinds of infections .
al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients less than 18 years , the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients with Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients under plac@@ ebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin patients , al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in skin patients , about 90 % of patients from both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( cold @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation to the surface of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the advantages of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weigh@@ ed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small hospitals , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . , a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of a sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of res@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment the treatment should be broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies of secondary infected open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ ol in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was inadequate .
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs .
the effect of simultaneous use of retina and other top@@ ical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in humans after top@@ ical use on sc@@ ant skin or infected surface wounds ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin E@@ AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max according to top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin s@@ int@@ ment increased by 81 % on sk@@ ated skin of healthy adult men .
due to the low systemic exposure to top@@ ical use in patients , dosage adjustment is not required if top@@ ical retin@@ os@@ in@@ ulin is used during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast feeding should continue / stop or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , the benefit of breast@@ feeding should be weigh@@ ed for the baby and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for women .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections applied to Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effects of irrit@@ ation at the site , which concerned about 1 % of patients .
mode of effect Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly P@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective in@@ hibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by inter@@ acting on a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer @-@ Center .
binding to this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , blocks P @-@ binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some infection forms appears question@@ able , consultation by experts should be sought .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ am@@ ul@@ as against S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ response to the treatment in S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of stra@@ ins with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and on sc@@ aled skin for up to 7 days .
of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ in- o@@ int@@ ment twice daily for 5 days of top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
samples were taken on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and with the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after top@@ ical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 S@@ cra@@ cked skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng / h / ml ) 6@@ 60 @-@ times lower than the retina IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP escap@@ ement .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ opathy in human liver micro@@ som@@ ea was medi@@ ated primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies for oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive stroke of the liver and thy@@ roid .
in @-@ vitro examination on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo examination of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ) :
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study in rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to ≥ 3 @-@ times of estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were determined .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between one and 15 years of age , who are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immun@@ isation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be completed .
if a suscep@@ ti@@ bility to hepatitis A or B is desirable , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given .
vacc@@ ines act as they &quot; teach &quot; the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can fight against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vacc@@ ination that has been approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination that has been approved since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , however , in the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses , the three vacc@@ ines are administered .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six @-@ month and a 12 month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to six months and a 12 month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 vacc@@ ines ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain on the injection site , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ation ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may react sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als to the company s.@@ a. a permit for the placing on the market of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the Stand@@ ardis@@ ation plan for pri@@ ori@@ tization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two doses of vacc@@ ination , with the first dose being administered at the date of choice and the second dose ranges from six to twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster shot is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or a combination vaccine .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ H@@ V ) antibody levels are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured that immun@@ o@@ competent persons who responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a booster shots as protection , as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the injection of the vaccine .
if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s @-@ antibody @-@ value is reached after the pri@@ mer @-@ muni@@ zation , so that in these cases the administration of further doses of vacc@@ ines may be required .
since intra@@ orbit@@ al injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal result in intra@@ muscular injection , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disturbances , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected as an exception , as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration .
if Ambi@@ rix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ isation and preservatives @-@ containing vaccine form@@ ulations .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 doses of vacc@@ ines were given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and mat@@ edness on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the placement of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects received Ambi@@ rix administered about pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who received Ambi@@ rix in comparison with 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and mat@@ ur@@ ation was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year @-@ old in@@ oc@@ ulations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
statisti@@ cally , the proportion of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose immun@@ isation scheme with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose immun@@ isation scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical studies carried out in V@@ acc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the anti @-@ HB@@ s Ser@@ o@@ conversion rates were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted between 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was evalu@@ able , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3 @-@ tin vaccine than with Ambi@@ rix .
the responses , which were obtained in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after the completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ ines received either a 2 @-@ dose immun@@ isation scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ming , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to those detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of a total of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study in 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after im@@ muni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine scheme compared to the in the 0 @-@ 12 months vaccine .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix was given at the same time with the booster set of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ e- , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza vaccine ( D@@ T@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les m@@ um@@ ps @-@ rub@@ ella vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults demonstrated the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates as for earlier formulation .
the vaccine is subject to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes , both before and after the conclusion of the procedure .
pursuant to Article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral food@@ stuff and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in waters contaminated by wastewater .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix may not fully protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses of Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child feel uncomfortable or feel ill at the time of vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to that of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction may result from it@@ ching skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you / your child has a severe infection with fever .
• If you would like to have a hepatitis B protection quickly ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually planned administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at the potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) .
the second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection before the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened by illness or treatment in your body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child is undergoing ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take more medicine ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have been given / has or is planned in the near future .
however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as different limbs as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be sufficient .
usually , Ambi@@ rix will not be given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 vacc@@ inated cans ) : • pain or discomfort on the punc@@ ture or redness • Mat@@ ter • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 vacc@@ inated cans ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Har@@ ness@@ ing • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
further side effects reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B are very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 vacc@@ inated cans ) are :
these include locally limited or extensive ras@@ hes that may itch or ves@@ ic@@ le , swelling of the eye area and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop in blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .
flu @-@ like ail@@ ments , including ch@@ ills , muscle and joint pain sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , sens@@ ations like ting@@ ling and &quot; ant @-@ run , &quot; multiple sclerosis , diseases of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or movement of some parts of the body , severe head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , interruption of normal brain functions

23 Check your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects you / your child significantly imp@@ airs or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which has been known since the initial approval for the placing on the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
however , since Ambi@@ rix was brought into circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicinal product is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mo@@ sis can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme failure or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mo@@ sis is - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ intestinal lamp ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading hose ) .
it was not a comparative study since am@@ mo@@ sis could not be compared with any other treatment or plac@@ ebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , i.e. without active agent ) .
am@@ mo@@ sis may also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disorders or flavor sa@@ unas , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that am@@ mo@@ sis was effectively prevented in patients suffering from disorders of the ure@@ a cycle to high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Am@@ mon@@ ola was admitted under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because , due to the r@@ arity of the disease , only limited information about this drug was available at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzyme already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication exists when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy is in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ amide @-@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thread@@ ed scar@@ pets .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders because there is a risk of the formation of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium chlori@@ de rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS therefore should only be used with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ a formation .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate occurs via the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
with sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) there was a slow@@ down in neur@@ onal reproduction and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least an undesi@@ rable event ( AE ) and 78 % of those adverse events were assumed to be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ too dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
one case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old inf@@ ant with an un@@ inten@@ tional single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous dosage of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound , con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate taken from 0.@@ 12 to 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine @-@ nitrogen can be produced for each gram .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ born was almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease even led to death in the treatment of per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues throughout the first year of life .
by means of ha@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium chlori@@ de , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ um ( however within the first life month ) to 80 % .
in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ite en@@ cephal@@ opathy , survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many intellectual disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late mani@@ f@@ al form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ thread@@ ed scar@@ let deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzymes with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and with repeated doses of oral doses up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous sodium yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after intake .
after varying doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in the next morning after fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) , the mean Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts on the third day .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate was not treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children who do not take tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or a gastro@@ drome or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carb@@ amide @-@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ thread@@ ed scar@@ pets .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , l@@ esi@@ ons occurred in the pyramid cells of the cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , who developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ too dosis , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , cur@@ b top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
sto@@ ich@@ i@@ ri@@ cally , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess fats
based on studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that , for each gram , sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible even in the treatment , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ule form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were detected 15 minutes after intake .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon weighing 8.@@ 6 g sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription medicines .
during breast@@ feeding you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the drug may move into mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , suppl@@ em@@ entation of hearing , dis@@ ori@@ enting , memory problems and deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were also observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or the emergency department of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment .
if you miss the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .
changes in the blood count ( red blood cells , white blood cells , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , unpleasant sm@@ ells , skin rash , kidney dys@@ functions , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects significantly imp@@ airs or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this user information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ iry date specified on the box and the container &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; User until &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and contents of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval form , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot;
30 When laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as sodium @-@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have taken it recently even if it is not prescription medicines .
you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS directly on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c th@@ ist@@ le ( tube that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( tube that is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ules . • P@@ ut a straight edge , e.g. a knife edge over the edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess pel@@ let . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon .
An@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood flow to the heart ) , for example in cases of unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different thickness ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stopping &quot; ( abnormal measurement value for electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if an@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox in the case of some administration or in connection with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient was often used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery in order to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ritu@@ xi@@ mab und A@@ spir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without GP@@ I - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks , or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox in terms of all indicators was just as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , other hi@@ rel@@ a , or any of the other ingredients .
it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as in people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the launch of angi@@ ox@@ in across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ) ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in emergency interven@@ ing or early intervention .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is performed in another row , an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
following clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dose can be taken from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
before surgery a bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox@@ in in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous bol@@ us of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of any bol@@ us administration from An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be achieved .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted pharmaceuticals need to be carefully mixed prior to the application and the bol@@ us dose should be given quickly intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subject to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din for ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dosage dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again .
in patients with moderate ren@@ al impair@@ ment , which were included in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , the ACT was 5 minutes after the administration of the Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients an@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of Low @-@ Molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to mal@@ functioning of the ha@@ emo@@ st@@ asy system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe un@@ controll@@ able hyper@@ tension and acute bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in patients with di@@ aly@@ sis
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with respect to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
although most ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages of arter@@ ial punc@@ tu@@ ation occur in PCI patients under Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can generally perform bleeding throughout the treatment .
in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , supervision of the IN@@ R @-@ Value ( International Reg@@ ent R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din reaches the prior treatment level once again .
based on the knowledge of the effective mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) , it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ asis parameters are regularly monitored .
the experimental studies are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , more than 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe ble@@ ed@@ ings were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe ble@@ ed@@ ings such as in the foot@@ notes of Table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings performed significantly less frequently under Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din than in the groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following occur@@ ren@@ ces : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular bleeding or bleeding in the punc@@ ture area , reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 4 g / dl with a known bleeding area , reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding locations which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ ture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with a bi@@ vali@@ dat@@ ine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group and in the comparison groups treated with he@@ par@@ in , more than 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less common among the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed into table 6 according to system organ classes .
in case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ine is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ hed with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and in the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of thro@@ mb@@ ine , regardless of whether the thro@@ mb@@ in is in the liquid phase or cl@@ ot@@ ting .
binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , a plat@@ el@@ et @-@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was not in@@ duci@@ ble to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te ag@@ gregation .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ omet@@ ru@@ din shows a dose @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proved by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was performed in the patients below , an additional bol@@ us of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the procedure should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting the angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly across the 3 arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

the 30 @-@ day results , based on four @-@ fold and triple @-@ outcomes of a random@@ ised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , are shown in Table 10 .
clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox@@ ic@@ in in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .
it is expected that Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din as Pep@@ tide has a cat@@ aboli@@ sm in its amino acid constitu@@ ents with subsequent re@@ utilization of the amino acids in the body pool .
the primary metabolism resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ ine is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ ine .
the elimination takes place in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a terminal half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
based on conventional studies on safety issues , toxic@@ ity in repeated doses , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans .
toxic@@ ity in animals after repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks during exposure up to 10 @-@ fa@@ ec@@ es of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was restricted to excessive pharmac@@ ological effects .
adverse events as a result of long @-@ term physiological stress in response to non @-@ home@@ opathic co@@ ag@@ ulation were not observed after short exposure comparable to that in clinical application , even at very much higher dosage .
if the manufacturing of the ready @-@ to @-@ use solution 17 is not controlled under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions , it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
An@@ gi@@ ox is a freeze @-@ dried powder in single @-@ dosing bottles of type 1 @-@ glass to 10 ml , which is sealed with a but@@ yl rubber stopper and sealed a cap made of pressed aluminum .
5 ml sterile water for injection purposes are given into a water bottle of An@@ gi@@ ox and easily swi@@ v@@ elled until everything has been completely dissolved and the solution is clear .
5 m@@ l. are taken from the pi@@ erc@@ ing bottle and dil@@ uted with 5 % glucose solution for injection or with 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de solution for injection in a total volume of 50 ml to obtain a final concentration of 5@@ mg / ml Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes who need a insulin treatment .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or which cannot effectively process insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ lip@@ sin differs very slightly from insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter active life than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in a study of 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied for type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed in comparison with a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin lip@@ o .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % with human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission granted San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH approval for the distribution of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall .
due to the reduced glucose tolerance and the reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of activity , the brand ( producers ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the need for insulin .
3 An insufficient dosage or termination of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and di@@ ab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life threatening .
the change@@ over of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the course of change in the treatment scheme .
the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia belong to oral anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , Dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate and Sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotic .
in addition , under the effect of sy@@ mp@@ a@@ the@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reserve , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c antagon@@ isms may be atten@@ u@@ ated or missing .
experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no difference between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ s@@ ine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin delivery exceeds human breast milk , but generally insulin is not absorbed into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed to oral application .
listed below are listed the adverse events known from clinical trials , group@@ ed by system organ@@ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 1,000 ; not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) .
cold sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive dogs , changes in vision , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy may occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , given by an appropriately trained person , or by intraven@@ ous doses of glucose by a doctor .
after an injection of glucose , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster with sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ lip@@ sin and the active life is shorter than in the normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin delivery in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose @-@ proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more than a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose @-@ lowering effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ lip@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves a complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
the data showed that a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached in an application of insulin @-@ lu@@ lip@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal as with the human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ lip@@ sin was applied 2 minutes before the meal , a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ al control than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal , was reached .
if insulin @-@ lu@@ lip@@ sin is turned around 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as in the human normal insulin , which is given 2 million before the meal ( see figure 1 ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ lip@@ sin in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ lip@@ sin in 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( N@@ OR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) .
