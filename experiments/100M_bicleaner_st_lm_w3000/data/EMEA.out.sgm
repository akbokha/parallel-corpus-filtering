<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the packing instructions (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like further information regarding the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. Zip thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I-disturbance, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and for the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbance if the oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be applied to the intake or the melting tablets in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This affects signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that allow neurotransmitters to communicate with each other.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl is believed to be a "partial agony" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole, such as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent, acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing its recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent the recurrence of symptoms was examined in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders that suffered from increased restlessness, over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder caused by increased restlessness with the Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in the patient's symptoms using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to inhale it.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg were significantly stronger in the symptoms of increased restlessness than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented more effective than 74 weeks as placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for inhalation (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disturbances (uncontrollable tick), vomiting, nausea, vomiting, nausea, nausea, nausea, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and in which the manic episodes relate to the treatment with Aripiprazl, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of injection solution in rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the transport of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly had manic episodes and their manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages of a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although individual patients could benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Taking into account the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results from an epidemiological study showed that there was no increased suicidal risk in patients with bipolar disorder compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazl should be prescribed cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, congestion, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If patients treated with Abilify are signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or break down the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore, Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had patients treated with Aripiprazole, an increased risk of death compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycaemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania as a result of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect, and may result in severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with overbearing side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and Paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as iraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram, or CYP2D6, together with Abilify, can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg of Aripiprazl per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometorphic / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (Varminin), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextrometorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are planning pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to insufficient data security for humans and due to the concerns raised in the reproductive studies in animals, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefit justifies clearly the potential risk for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned that dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, should be operated until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of over 52 weeks, a total lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS, including parsonism, acathallerism, dystonia and dyskinesia, compared to patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 13.1% was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% was reported in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients under Ourapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">In a controlled study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients treated with haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazl treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients treated with Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and Placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional acute overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although no information on the efficacy of haemodialysis occurs in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that haemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose because Aripiprazole has a high plasma transmission.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disturbance is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic action on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">In vitro, Aripiprazole showed a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and serotonin 5HT1 and 5HTA receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">With dosage of Aripiprazole in doses of 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks on healthy subjects, positron emission tomography revealed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Raccoprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, on Nucleus caudatus and on putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled trial, 52 percent of responder patients enduring a response to the study were similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and Haloperdol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg- depression rate scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than for haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole significantly reduced the rate of relapse, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Oscar-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed a superiority to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial lasting 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and actively controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy comparable to placebo in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">Furthermore, in week 12 Aripiprazole showed a comparable share of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expulsion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazole showed superiority to the prevention of bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxylopathy of Aripiprazl, the N-dealkylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elminating age is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole in extensive metabollization via CYP2D6 and at approximately 146 hours at 'poor' (= 'poor') metabollization via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy subjects, as did pharmacokinetic investigation of schizophrenic patients with no gender-dependent effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A review-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics did not reveal clinically significant differences regarding ethnicity ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy subjects.</seg>
<seg id="93">One single dose survey in subjects with various liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the detriment of liver function on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is insufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety and toxicity, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and canogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or exposures, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (which is 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, cholelithiasis was determined as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites in Aripiprazole in bile after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or 16- to 81x of the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugates of Hydroxy- Aripiprazol at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were not more than 6% of the concentrations found in the Galle of apes in the study and are well below the limit values (6%) of in vitro-solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">These effects were observed in rabbits after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3 and 11 times the mid-average steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="102">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disturbance is mediated via the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic action on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="103">22 In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks followed by a long-term expulsion phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole during a stabilization phase, Aripiprazole was superior to the prevention of bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended under circumvention of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines already used for maintenance or acute therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If further oral treatment is indicated with Aripiprazl, see the summary of the characteristics of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution for inclusion.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution in patients with aggravation and behavioural disorders, which were otherwise caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazol injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazl injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribing or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazl should be prescribed cautiously in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischaemic heart disease, congestion, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including active and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and arrhythmia).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagy and weakness should be observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of deteriorating glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania as a result of comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as a side effect and may result in severe complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was larger compared to that after a dose of Aripiprazole, in a study where healthy subjects were administered intravenously in the healthy volunteers Aripiprazole (15 mg dose) and who received Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, decreases the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' metabolicers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as iraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, should have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After placing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be increased to the dose level before the start of the accompanying therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were received intramuscular, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that after some administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazl injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% was placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study over 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled trial, the incidence of EPS 18.2% was for patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazole and Placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">The side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy and their incidence also reported in the treatment with Aripiprazol include the malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazole injection solution with statistically significant increased improvement of aggravation / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggregation and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of aggravation and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference poor.</seg>
<seg id="173">The observed mean improvement from the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe aggregation, a similar activity was observed regarding the total population, but a statistical significance could be determined on the basis of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) at 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of responder patients with a response to study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol (73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measuring scales, which were defined as secondary objectives, including PANSS and the Montgomery-asberg-depression rate scale, showed a significantly stronger improvement than for haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of over 26 weeks in stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a significantly higher decrease in the rate of relapse, which was at 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Oscar-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia for 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in part did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy for therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole resulted in superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study program in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazole prior to randomization, Aripiprazole was superior to placebo with regard to the prevention of bipolar relapse, predominantly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger than the dosage of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy subjects, the mean time to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="184">The gift of Aripiprazl injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated dose during systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- and 5 times higher than the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscular.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following intravenous application there were no safety-related concerns following maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29-times (rabbits) above the maximum human-therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazl (oral) for safety macology, toxicity in repeated doses, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the canogenic potential, preclinical data showed no particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure of humans; therefore, they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin-pigment-accumulation and / or parenchycell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at 60 mg / kg / day (which is 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, cholelithiasis was diagnosed as a result of the precipitation of sulphate conjugates of the hydroxy- metabolites in Aripiprazole in bile after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (the 1 to 3 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81-fold of the recommended maximum dosage in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of the 3- and 11-fold of the middle steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dosage.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxanes was studied in a study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, three quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in any dose or as a monotherapy) was compared with the drug containing conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of the 229 patients treated with Abraxane responded to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only those patients who have been treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time, there was no difference between the drugs in terms of the efficacy indicators, such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast, patients who previously had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may also not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients receiving the first treatment more effectively than conventional paclitaxel and that in contrast to other medicines containing paclitaxel it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the BioScience Limited Company a permit for the placing of Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="292">The following are the most common and major incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, which were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported at 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anaemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the dose of Abraxane as monotherapy for each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>

<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, sore muscles, discomfort in limbs, muscle weakness, very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrobial agent that promotes the accumulation of microtubules from the tubules and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtububar network, which is essential for the vital interphase and mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin imparts the transacytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in the course of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through the endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albumreceptor and is a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumor due to the albuminous protein SPARC (cream secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The use of Abraxanes for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single-arm, non-faunal studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In one study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, given an infusion of 175 mg / m2 in an infusion of more than 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma over 30 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premedication for prevention of an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study 64% of patients had impaired general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received no chemotherapy, 27% had only one adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% due to metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First-Line therapy are outlined below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by improving one degree for patients who experienced a peripheral Neuropathie grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for decay on baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">Pharmacokinetics of the overall paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="316">The exposure to active substances (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous injection of Abraxanes to patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in a multiphase manner.</seg>
<seg id="318">The mean distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular dispersion and / or soft tissue binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study involving patients with advanced solid tumours, paclitaxel's pharmacokinetic properties were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 Abraxane with values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg. / m2 of solvent containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane administration (43%) as after a solvent containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers it is reported that paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxanes in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value for cumulative urination of unchanged compounds was 4% of the given total dose of less than 1% of the metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates a far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>

<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with illnesses for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who wish to make an own blood donation, Absenamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the haemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to make sure there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by erythropoietinal lack or that the body does not adequately respond to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the effects of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that enables it to educate epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference medicinal product when administered as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected into a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to streamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of streamed suction amed with those of Eprex / Erypo were studied in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from anaemia caused by kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abatamed were maintained to the same extent as in those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, the patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the output value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelling migraine-like headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Streamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>

<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiplous myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general state (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anemia at the onset of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-saving measures are not available or insufficient, with planned larger operating procedures that require large blood volume (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>

<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for paediatric patients, where the haemoglobin concentration should be between 9.5 and 11 g / dL (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anemia and disease may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease. therefore, the doctor requires an assessment of the individual clinical course and disease status.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual haemoglobin values can be observed in a patient above or below the haemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should try to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the hemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the durable hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin-alfa dose is reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest permissible dose, which is required for control of anaemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low hob value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in whom initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">These clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low hob value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than patients in whom initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Initial dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week using intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anemia and sequelae may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease. therefore, the doctor requires an assessment of the individual clinical course and disease status.</seg>
<seg id="396">In view of this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should try to reach the haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest permissible dose, which is required for the control of the anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If the haemoglobin value of at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulocytes has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.U. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the cell count &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.U. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value of ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of reticulocytes has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose should be sustained by 300 I.U. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value of &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the number of reticulocytes increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, a response to epoetin-alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canceled.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematokrit 33-39%), where the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood canned foods is required, should receive abyamed at a dose of 600 I.U. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should begin as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the beginning of the autologous blood donation program, so that large iron reserves are available prior to the beginning of the streamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg of epoetin alfa, which should be given once weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (Day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should preoperatively be given 300 I.U. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery and 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>

<seg id="409">In patients foreseen for greater elective orthopaedic surgery and which cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the use of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, escort or underlying disease: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial disease, vascular disease of the carotides or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastomenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported via the occurrence of an antibody-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased demand for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes for a failure (iron, folate or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminescence, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticulocytes), is lower (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 0.5%), thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an action loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow for the diagnosis of a PRCA should be weighed.</seg>
<seg id="413">Data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of streamed in patients with a risk of an antibody-induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration, recommended in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropotile-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the gift of epoetines when the haemoglobin concentration is increased over the concentration required for controlling the anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should be around 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evidently coronary heart disease or congestive heart disease, maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of haemoglobin target concentration, recommended in Section 4.2.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia associated with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet to be dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2 - 3-week lag between epoetin-alfa-Gabe and erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients who may need to be transfunded).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is higher than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 in order to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapic anaemia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the haemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the participation of the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">In patients who are intended for greater elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, before beginning of epoetin-alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients who undergo greater elective orthopaedic surgery should receive appropriate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it cannot be excluded that for treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial haemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl a higher risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events can exist.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epochs did not prove that tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia will improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy were returned when a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was aspired</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the increasing hematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues there are no indications of interactions between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differences or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">About thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral ischemic attacks, deep venous thromboses, arterial thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, retinas, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin treatment, including patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during the treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the worsening of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascultic events (see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients treated with erythropoetines.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin treatment, it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="578">The risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41% compared to patients with hyperoporosis (with or without osteoporosis treatment).</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture 9% of the patients under Acupa had a fracture (92 of 1 065) versus 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of the side effects of Acspana occur within the first three days after the infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">It may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to cioledron acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with acetaminosis are subject to the risk of kidney complaints, reactions to the infusion and osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">The manufacturer of Acspana provides clarification material for physicians who prescribe aclasta for the treatment of osteoporosis which contains information about how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and indicated when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited for the distribution of Acspana throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The Patient Information Package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • Compensation in pregnancy and lactating women • Required for adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, adequate physical activity, non smoking and healthy eating • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When treating to medical or nursing aid</seg>
<seg id="588">Treatment of osteoporosis • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including in patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">Intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the aclasta infusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Acspana should be prescribed only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Paget disease with aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first acupa infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Acspana is not recommended as limited clinical experience exists for this patient group.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) It is not necessary to adjust the dosage as the bioavailability, distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18, since data on safety and effectiveness are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Acupa is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypocalysis is to be treated with an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the beginning of the treatment (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of Zoledron leic acid on bone reconstruction, temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypothalmia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Acupa (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget a sufficient intake of calcium, corresponding twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be considered before an application of bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental interventions, no data is available, whether the interruption of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the application of acetamol (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The frequency of cases reported as severe side effects of atrial fibrillation was increased (1,3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 of 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Acupa (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very frequent (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Kidney function disorder Zoledron acid was associated with kidney dysfunctions, which were referred to as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The change in the creatinin Clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the occurrence of kidney failure as well as impaired renal function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years compared to the Aclasta- and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with acetaminA compared to 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium levels below the normal range of fluctuation (less than 2,10 mmol / l) occurred in 2.3% of patients treated with Acspana in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with acetaba in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study, in the study to avoid clinical fractures following a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures following a recently fractured hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of acetone (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions after the administration of Zoledron acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been used, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primarily in the jaw area) that were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental intervenes.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study involving 7,736 patients showed osteoarthritis in the jaw area in a patient treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of an overdose that leads to a clinically relevant hypoglycemia, a compensation can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Acspana 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was indicated in postmenopausal women (7,736 females aged 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density sword (BMD) -T-Score for the Schenkeldog ≤ - 2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spine fractures of aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients aged 75 years and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Acspana showed a consistent effect over three years, resulting in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%) reduced risk of hip fractures.</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Acupa increased bone density at lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the scarlet neck by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Osteohistology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with acetone (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the basin comb.</seg>
<seg id="628">In comparison to placebo, a microcomputed tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume compared to placebo and the preservation of the trabecular bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone replacement markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminale propontid of the type-I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C-Telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients at intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of Acupa reduced significantly by 30% compared to baseline and was maintained at 28% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U.) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the treated group compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, compared to placebo treatment, the BMD increased the BMD at all points of time compared to placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="636">Compared to placebo treatment, the aclasta treatment led to an increase in BMD by 5.4% compared to placebo treatment and 4.3% at the threshold.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in men In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients BMD was assessed after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in the clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in acetone-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once yearly administration of acetone in comparison to the once weekly dose of Alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change in the lumbar vertebra BMD after 24 months compared to baseline.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment in the disease of the bone Aclasta has been studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 with radiologically confirmed, above all light to moderately heavy disease Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase corresponding to the 2,6fold to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value when included in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of Zoledron acid compared to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months has been demonstrated in two six-month comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed in comparison with the initial value for aclasta and risedronate after 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study (responded to the therapy) could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">Of the 143 patients treated with acetone and the 107 patients treated with Risedronat, the therapeutic response was achieved in 141 patients treated with acetyla compared to 71 of the patients treated with Risedronat during an average follow-up of 18 months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of persistent infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg Zoledron acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level rose rapidly to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h, followed by a very low concentration of very low concentrations, no more than 0.1% of the peak value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large circulatory cycle with half-life t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β-1,87 hours followed by a long elminating phase with a terminal elioration period t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β with the above t ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid resorption into the bones and excretion via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose is found in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance amounts to 5,04 ± 2.5 l / h independent of the dose and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentrations against time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced Clearance of Metrachrom-P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because Zoledron acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, material-altering inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see Section 4.2) The renal Clearance of Coledron Acid correlated with the Kreatinin Clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinin Clearance, and in the 64 examined patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and a moderate renal dysfunction right down to a creatinin-clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the cioledron acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since only limited data is available for severe kidney Dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min), no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">The highest non-Latvian intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">In studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC would be 6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure), administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerance of zoledron acid in rats was administered by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dosage that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulative exposures exceeding the maximum of the intended human exposure, toxicological effects of other organs, including gastrointestinal tract and liver, and intravenous injection.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most common finding in studies with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphysise of long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a findings that reflects the pharmacological, antioxidant action of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">Rats showed teratogenicity at doses of 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although maternal toxicity was marked by 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the low serum calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledron acid is a substance of a substance called bisphosphonate and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens which are made from androgens, play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">At the Morbus Paget, the bone structure is too fast, and new bone material is structured unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Acupa works by normalizing the bone structure again, ensuring normal bone formation and thus restoring strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been taken / used recently, even if it is not prescription medicines.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is particularly important for your doctor to know if you are taking pharmaceuticals that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drinks, be sure that you take sufficient fluids according to your doctor's instructions before and after the treatment with aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="679">Osteoporosis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year, which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an infusion in a vein.</seg>

<seg id="681">The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as an infusion in a vein.</seg>
<seg id="682">Since Acupa works for a long time, you may need to take another dose after a year or longer.</seg>
<seg id="683">It is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in your blood during the time after the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="684">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta can work for more than a year, and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment.</seg>
<seg id="685">If the administration is missed, contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment.</seg>
<seg id="686">Before stopping the treatment with Acspana Falls you are considering the completion of the treatment with Acspana, please take your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion frequently occur (in more than 30% of patients), but less frequent after the subsequent infusion.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache appear within the first three days of the administration of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="689">Currently, it is unclear whether Acupa causes this irregular heartbeat, but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="690">Physical symptoms because of too low calcium concentration in the blood, such as muscle cramps or tingling or numbness, especially in the area around the mouth.</seg>

<seg id="696">Patients with a recently suffered low-traumatic hip fracture are recommended to carry out the infusion of aclasta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="697">Before and after the administration of acetone, patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid; this is particularly important in patients receiving diuretic therapy.</seg>
<seg id="698">Due to the rapid insertion of the effect of oledron acid on bone structure a temporary, sometimes symptomatic, hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the infusion of Acupa.</seg>
<seg id="699">In addition, it is highly advisable to ensure sufficient intake of calcium in patients with Morbus Paget, according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially obese patients) in which metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated. • It can be used together with another diabetes medicine (dual therapy).</seg>
<seg id="751">It can be used in addition to metformin in patients (especially obese patients), which cannot be satisfactorily set with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylic resp or insulin, the existing dosage of the sulfonylic resin or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here the dose of the sulfonylic resin or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level drops, enabling type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy and the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylic resp, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced when applying doses of 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of an additional dosage of Actos for existing treatment with metformin and sulfonylic resp decreased by 0.94% while the additional placement of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, patients with Actos added to insulin, reduced HbA1c values from 0.69% after 6 months compared to 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypoesthesia (decreased sensitivity to irritation).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other ingredients, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone level - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission granted the Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to approve the transport of Actos throughout the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus whose blood sugar is inadequately adjusted with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">This study showed an increase in reports on heart failure, but this did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with elevated liver enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone cannot be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme levels are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, torchiness, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme levels must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with pioglitazone should be guided by clinical assessment until the laboratory parameters are present.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with pioglitazone a dose-dependent weight gain has been detected that can agitate from fatty deposits and in some cases is associated with fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution a minor reduction of the mean haemoglobin values (relative reduction of 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction of 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients with metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and haematocrits by 3.1%) and insulin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 1-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two or triple-combination therapy with a sulfonylic resp or as a dual combination therapy with insulin are the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, a reduction of visual acuity was reported under the treatment with thiazolidindia, including pioglitazone, an occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema there is a direct connection, but killing physicians should be aware of the possibility of a macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological investigation should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in the women treated with Pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is to be discontinued (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazon has no relevant effects on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA-reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase in the AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazon with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a 54% reduction in the AUC from Pioglitazon.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreased and thus the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; often &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, single cases: unknown (not estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical trials with pioglitazone, ALT engravings of the three times the upper limit of the normal range appeared as frequently as under placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonylic resin.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure under Pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under placebo if Pioglitazone bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often if pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events concerning fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with Pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the treated groups.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures at 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with Pioglitazone were compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazon seems to have an activation of specific receptors (Peroxisome Proliferator activated Receptor-γ) (PPAR-γ)), which results in an increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It was shown that Pioglitazone reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose level in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclastoma versus monotherapy has been continued for over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time of two years after the treatment, a blood glucose control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by Pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar had been insufficiently discontinued despite three months of optimization were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients under Pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decline in albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decline of albumin / Kreatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small study of type 2 diabetic patients in 18 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol and a slight but clinically not significantly increased LDL cholesterol level were observed in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the total plasma matriglycerides and free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol level compared to placebo, metformin or gliclincidal.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was found under Pioglitazone, while under metformin and gliclacide values decreased.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of over 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on triglyceride concentrations and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, whereby the peak concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone in plasma are usually reached 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the three-fold effectiveness of Pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, pioglitazone has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics or pharmacokinetics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans, the marker was found mainly in the barrels (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elminating age of unaltered pioglitazone amounts to 5-6 hours in humans, and that of the entire active metabolites is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced renal function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">Toxicological studies performed in mice, rats, dogs and apes following repeated dosing of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible eccentric heart hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperinsulin- and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal is reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased incidence of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary bladder was induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindia led to an increased frequency of colonic tumours.</seg>

<seg id="825">In another study over two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin were investigated with each pioglitazone or gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials more than 1 year, a statistically significant decline in albumin / creatinine quotients showed a statistically significant decline in the output.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, this has an effect on the tryglyceride absorption and the hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study was lacking in its primary endpoint, a combination of total mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation upstream of the ankle, coronary revascularisation and revascularisation of the leg arteries, the results suggest that the intake of pioglitazone does not entail cardiovascular long-term risks.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane was studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes, in which the body is unable to effectively use insulin.</seg>
<seg id="865">In the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were similar to another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">In addition, the doses of actraphane need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package inserts).</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of actraphane were outweighed in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">In October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the transport of actraphane to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily if a fast initial action is desired together with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">For example, patients whose blood sugar level has improved significantly by an intensified insulin therapy can change the hypoglycaemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change in terms of strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA in relation to insulin of animal origin) may cause a change in the dosage.</seg>

<seg id="1192">In clinical studies, the use of naproxen or other NSAR / cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / Hydrochlorthiazide / Warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without the need for a dose adjustment for Febuxostat or the other active ingredient applied at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study involving subjects, 120 mg of ADENURIC 1 x daily treated an average 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, which indicates a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous consumption of an antazione containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminium hydroxide delayed the absorption of Febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a reduction in the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not cause side effects of Febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>

<seg id="1225">In healthy subjects, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose are proportionally proportional.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, a rise in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is larger than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the Cmax amounts approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>

<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the esophagus, the patient must not lie down until the first food intake of the day, which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronat and vitamin D3 are already used separately from each other in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data derived from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (11%) compared to those who exclusively received alendronate (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendronate contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are headache, musculoskeletal pain (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), constipation, diarrhea (ulcera) of esophagus, dysphagie (swallowing disorders), nasal abdomen (blower abdomen) as well as acidic impact.</seg>

<seg id="1291">Oesophageal reactions, such as oesophagitis, elophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strokes, were reported in patients taking Alendronate (partially these were severe and required hospitalisation).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore pay attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malignanhageal reactions, and patients should be advised to take out the medicine in the occurrence of symptoms of ophageal irritation such as dysphagie, pain in swallowing or retrostarred pain or new or worsening heartburn (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of serious bad-hageal side effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine properly and / or continue to take it after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions be passed on to the patient and understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>

<seg id="1402">Since Tacrolimus and Prograf / Prograft are already being used in the EU, the company presented the results of previously conducted studies with Prograf / Prograft as well as data from published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1403">In addition, the results of a clinical study were submitted to 668 patients with kidney transplant, whereby the application was compared with Prograf / Prograft or Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="1404">The main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplant was aborted after a year of treatment (by examining how often a renewed organ transplant or resumption of dialysis was necessary).</seg>
<seg id="1405">In addition, shorter studies were conducted on 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplantation and examined how Advagraf is absorbed by the body compared to Prograf / Prograft.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes in immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinical relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this may lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and daily dosage; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of an experienced physician (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">As a result of switching to an alternative formulation, a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of Advagraf should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus-Talks should be controlled before the changeover and over two weeks after conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure was comparable to both both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated checks of tacrolimus-tallow levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under Advagraf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Since tacrolimus is a low-Clearance substance, it can take several days to adjust the advagraf dosage schedule until the steady state is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1420">The immunosuppression has to be maintained to suppress the graft rejection; consequently, a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified.</seg>
<seg id="1421">Recommended Dosage - Kidney Transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.20 - 0.30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1422">Further dosage adjustments may be necessary later because the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus can change during the course of stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1423">Dosage recommendations - liver transplant prophylaxis of graft rejection The oral Advagraf therapy should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a daily dose in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advagraf must be converted a transplant recipients from twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of advagraf, so this changeover has to be done in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">After switching from other immunosuppressants to advagraph once a day, the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplant must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant In adult patients who are switched to Advagraf, an oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is to be taken daily once in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">In an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day for transplant recipients.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood-talcals in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose may be necessary in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced renal function Since the kidney function does not affect pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus, it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatine inspection, calculation of creatininin and monitoring of urinary volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf At the conversion from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations to the level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rejection and tolerability in the individual case with the aid of full blood Tacrolimus-Talmirrors-checks.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to carry out frequent monitoring of the tacrolimus test levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood-Talks of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after conversion from Prograf to Advagraf, dose-adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances that could change the whole blood-blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">As Advagraf is a drug with a low clearance, adjustments to the dose may require several days until the steady state has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">The data in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the level of the blood is not exceeding 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the level of tacrolimus in full blood is usually present in the area of 5 - 20 ng / ml and transplanted and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects that may occur in a result of tacrolimus maintenance or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formula and daily dosage; changes of formulation or regime should only be carried out under close-meshed control of an experienced physician (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data available for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">For prophylaxis of graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and graft recipients, no clinical data is yet available for the retarded formulation Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to potential interactions leading to a reduction of the tacrolimus in the blood and weakening the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies is avoided during a treatment with Advagraf (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered, since the Tacrolimus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases prograf was a cardiomyopathy referred to as aqueous or septum hypertrophy, which can therefore also occur under Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid excess and oedema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions by appropriate clothing or use of a sun protective agent with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take tacrolimus, show symptoms for PRES such as headaches, altered states of consciousness, convulsions and vision disorders, should be a radiological examination (e.g.</seg>
<seg id="1449">As Advagraf contains hard capsules, retarded, lactose, patients with rare hereditary galactose intolerance, lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and, consequently, raise or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can change the CYP3A's metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dosage accordingly (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A strongly pronounced interaction was associated with antimycotics such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, iraconazole and Voriconazole as well as with the macrolide antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z.</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the rise in blood levels is mainly due to the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">High-dose prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other Tacrolimus patients is known as CYP3A4 inhibitors; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Since tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of Steroid contraceptives and thus increase the hormone exposure, it is particularly cautious in decisions regarding contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal studies have shown that tacrolimus can potentially reduce the Clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of studies on transplant patients do not indicate that under tacrolimus, compared to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Active mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be conveyed through its binding to a cytosol protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for enriching the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calciumdependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell and thus prevents the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Tacrolimus inhibits the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T-helper cells, further the formation of lymphokines (such as interleukin-2, interleukin-3 and γ-interferon) as well as the expression of the interleukin-2 receptor.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral prograf revealed in these published studies the observations in the large studies where prograf was used in liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients for primary immunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recent, multicentre study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported who received either tacrolimus or Ciclosporin as part of a 1: 1 randomization.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was less frequently observed in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after a year was 80.8% in the Tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin Group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the case of patients treated with tacrolimus, the incidence of a Bronchiolitis obliterans occurred in 21.7% compared to 38.0% under Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases where Ciclosporin had to be converted to tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients being converted from tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which there was no acute graft rejection was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in lung transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung Transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In one study, the frequency of the emergence of a bronchiolitis obliterate syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multi-center trial with oral prograf was carried out in 205 patients undergoing a pancreatic and kidney transplantation following a randomised Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102) procedure.</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the target level of 8 to 15 ng / ml on the 5th.</seg>
<seg id="1492">In 155 patients (65 only intestines, 75 liver and intestine and 25 multiviszeral grafts) under tacrolimus and prednisone, the published clinical results of a monocentric clinical trial with oral prograf showed an up-to-date survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the unbound faction of tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with corticosteroids, should be responsible for the higher clearing rates observed after transplantation.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This can be concluded that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion mainly occurs across the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients, which were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraf (once daily) in relation 1: 1 (mg: mg), systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advocate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (one caused by the lack of factor VIII related, congenital blood clotting disorder).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether it is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>

<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced into the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advocate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Recombinate, but it is produced differently so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was studied to prevent bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of advate in the prevention of haemorrhages in 86% of 510 new blood grades with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common adverse events of Advate (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against Factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advocates may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Baxter AG for the placing on the market of Advocates throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, on the place and the extent of bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following hemorrhages, factor VIII activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels (in% of the standard or in I.U. / dl).</seg>

<seg id="1544">Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of treatment, the dose and frequency of injections are advised to determine the factor VIII plasma level in order to control the dose to be administered and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to Factor VIII, achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value periods.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be doses between 20 and 40 I.U. by factor VIII per kg body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose, a test must be performed to detect an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the Factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The transfer speed should depend on the patient's condition, where a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) against Factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against procoagulatory activity by factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml of plasma by means of modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to Factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure-days and anamnestically known inhibitors development, after conversion from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (lowest) inhibitors was observed.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefits risk assessment as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, based on the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided that the authorisation holder must apply for another extension procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008, Gendux Molecular Limited announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdrew its application for approval for the application of Adventiin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, breast, brain, bones or soft tissues (tissues that connect, surround and support other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus, genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Adventiin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of themselves and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advection would have been injected directly into the tumours and thus enable cancer cells to regain the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the p53 gene that is not defective in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">At Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can grow and share.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient, in which Li-Fraumeni Cancer stood in the abdominal area, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP examined the answers of the company to the questions he asked, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP created a list of questions sent to the company by day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP opinion, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that Adventiin injections in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore bring benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company has not adequately proven that advection can be established in a reliable way and that it is harmful neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not inform CHMP about whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently taking part in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programmes with Adventiin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "modified active ingredients" "" "means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerosaze is used to treat symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and young people from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerosol is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and be terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose) are cloned.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy dimensions were the changes in the severity of hay fever, reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were during the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms other than the constipation of the nose, the patients reported that the aero received a decrease in the symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients who took pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aeropaze showed a reduction of the symptoms by 37.4% versus 26.7% in the patients who lost Descent's adin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerosaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart hunting), dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerosol may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) against desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or loratadin (another medicine for treating allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerosol may also not be used in patients suffering from narrow angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), cardiac or vascular diseases including hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension of the thyroid) or have a hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the placing on the market of aerosins across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing it, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and effectiveness (see Section 5.1), Aerosaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is to be kept as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days as long-term application can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine over time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, the treatment can be continued as a monotherapy if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerosaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deconjunctiva, which can be performed peroral or nasally as abovels of rhinology (phenylpropanolamine, phenymetazoline, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, napololin etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient population and the data do not suffice to address the appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerosins were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data do not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that the treatment must be reduced in case of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches).</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, caution is advised: • Patients with heart rhythm disorders • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerosaze is at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests because antihistamines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions or reduce it to their extent.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical trials with desloratadin in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentrations of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">In the results of the psychomotor test, no significant differences could be found between the patients treated with placebo and placebo, regardless of whether or not that loratadin was alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In vivo CYP3A4 does not inhibit Desloratadin, and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the use of aerosaze during pregnancy is not secured, experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies, however, resulted in no increase in the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Because reproductive studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerosaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a dizziness, which may impair traffic impermeability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, reduced mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with possible sequential processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, respiratory failure, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, premenstrual pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atroin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil starre and - dilatation, redness, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose survey with adults, Desloratadin showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies, there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage may cause other sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS excitation.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged 12 and 78 years participated with seasonal allergic rhinitis, 414 patients received aerosaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerosaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerosaze tablets in terms of the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerosaze tablets did not show significant differences with regard to patient subsets defined by gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of an individual dose survey on the pharmacokinetics of aerosol, desloratadin can be detected within 30 minutes after administration of the plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerosins in healthy subjects over 14 days, the body weight of Desloratadin, 3-Hydroxydesloratadin and Pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multiple dose study, which was conducted using the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were badly metabolised of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine is bioequivalent to exposure to an aerosaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional safety studies, toxicity of repeated doses, toxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with deserloratadin however does not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of lauatadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in module 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation, Pharmakovigilance is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines help alleviate the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, to unfold its effect.</seg>
<seg id="1706">Aerosaze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever), such as sneezing, running or itching nose and soothing or itching eyes while constipation of the nose.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the launch of loratadin, very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rashes were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart-hunting, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, insomnia with increased physical activity, over cases of inflammation of the liver and about cases of conspicuous liver values has also been reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and 0.5 mg / ml-solution for intake.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was studied in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies with seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness has been measured by identifying the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadrats, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution to inhale and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use of children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of an allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of Aerius resulted in an average reduction of the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies with urticaria, the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared with 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadin, lauatadin or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a licence to the company SP Europe for the marketing of Aerius throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet daily, with one or without a meal, to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience in clinical studies on efficacy in the use of loratadin in young people aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the current clinical course and can be terminated following the severity of the symptoms and resuming their recovery.</seg>
<seg id="1732">Persist allergic rhinitis (appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks) may be recommended to patients during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical trials with desloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical-pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in dizziness, which may impair traffic impermeability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most commonly reported adverse events reported as reported in placebo were fatigue (1.2%), mouth dryness (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study involving 578 young patients from 12 to 17 years, the most common side effect was headaches, which occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and at 6.9% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">In a multi-dose survey of up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose), no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as inhibiting the expression of the adhesion molecules P-Selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">In the course of a clinical trial with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persistent allergic rhinitis depending on duration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown by the World Questionnaire on Quality of Life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria has been investigated in the form of other forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology, regardless of etiology, is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be randomly recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">As histamine irritation is a cause of all age-related diseases, it is expected that, apart from chronic idiopathic urticaria, other forms of urticaria may lead to an improvement in the symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrats at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistaminika in chronically idiopathic urticaria, the study excluded the minority of patients who did not react to antihistamines.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improving itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius significantly reduced sleep and waking disturbance, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, in which patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications for clinically relevant cumulation after a daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not entirely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">In vivo did not inhibit CYP3A4 and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1759">In a single dose study with desloratadin in a dosage of 7.5 mg, meals (fatty, calory rich breakfast) did not affect the availability of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1760">The preclinical studies conducted with deserloratadin and lauatadin showed no qualitative or quantitative differences regarding the toxicity profile of Desloratadin and Loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Based on conventional studies on safety issues, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with deserloratadin do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken independently from meals to relieve symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years of age are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data that support a treatment of an infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin tests should play a role in the diagnosis.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metabolise desloratadin and experience a higher endurance strain (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup in children between 2 and 11 years, which are fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who are metabolic.</seg>
<seg id="1768">This drug contains sucrose and sorbitol; therefore, patients with hereditary problems of fructose intolerance, glucose-galactose absorption or sucrose-isomaltase- insufficiency should not take this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1769">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1770">In a clinical-pharmacological study, taking Aerius tablets and alcohol has not increased the performance-reducing effect of alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1771">The overall frequency of adverse events in children from 2 to 11 years was similar to the Aerius Sirup group as in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="1772">In clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported in patients with Aerius than those treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1773">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose survey of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dosage).</seg>
<seg id="1774">Children between 1 and 11 years of age who came into question for an antihistamtherapy were given a daily desloratadindose of 1.25 mg (aged between 1 and 5 years) or 2.5 mg (aged between 6 and 11 years).</seg>
<seg id="1775">Because the progression of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">In a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1777">In a clinical-pharmacological study involving adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied over ten days in adults, no extension of the Qtc interval appeared.</seg>
<seg id="1778">In controlled clinical trials there was no increased frequency of sleepiness compared to placebo in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1779">With an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg, Aerius tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials showed no impairment of psychomotor functions.</seg>
<seg id="1780">In clinical-pharmacological studies of adults, the simultaneous consumption of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of the alcohol-induced performance impairment nor an increase in somnolence.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In adult and adolescent patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tear and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1782">As shown on the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius tablets are effectively reducing the caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis</seg>
<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and the reduction of size and number of quadrats at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this restricted metabolism phenotype was similar in adults (6%) and children from 2 to 11 years (6%) and in both populations greater than black (18% adults, 16% children) than in Caucasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose survey with the syrup formulation of children aged 2 to 11 with allergic rhinitis, which are fully metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1786">The load (AUC) by Desloratadin was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the Cmax was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half-life of approximately 120 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1787">There are no indications for clinically relevant drug accumulation after a daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) for 14 days in adults and adolescents.</seg>
<seg id="1788">12 Several single dose studies showed that AUC and Cmax values of desloratadin in paediatric patients were comparable with those of adults who received desloratadin syrup in a dosage of 5 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1789">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="1793">Immediately before applying, the blister must be opened carefully and the dose of the lyophilisate must be removed without damaging it.</seg>
<seg id="1794">Clinically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with Aerius tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally used (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1795">In clinical trials in various indications, including allergic rhinitis and chronically idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events in patients with Aerius tablets were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1796">In a multi-dose survey, where up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine times clinical dose) were applied, no clinically relevant effects were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In two single dose studies, Aerius Lyophilisate was well tolerated; this was documented by clinical laboratory results, medical examinations, vital signs and ECG interval data.</seg>
<seg id="1798">In a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1799">In a clinical-pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was applied in a dosage of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was applied over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval appeared.</seg>

<seg id="1801">In a 17 single-dose study with adults, Desloratadin showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1802">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius tablets were effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, lacrimal flow and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1803">As shown by the World Questionnaire on Quality of Life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the strain caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1804">18 In a pharmacokinetic study, in which the patients were comparable with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients were obtained a higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>

<seg id="1810">Before applying, the blister must be carefully opened and the dose of the tablet is removed without damaging it.</seg>
<seg id="1811">The efficacy and safety of Aerius 2.5 mg processed tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years has not been proven so far.</seg>
<seg id="1812">The overall frequency of adverse events between the desloratadine syrup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients.</seg>
<seg id="1813">At the recommended dose, Aerius Melt tablet proved to be a bioequivalent to the Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets and the Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate as a narcosis of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1814">In a clinical study with multiple doses, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically</seg>
<seg id="1815">In a single dose survey with adults, Desloratadin showed no influence on standard measurements of the flight performance including amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1816">The spread of this badly-metabolizing phenotype was similar to adult (6%) and pediatric patients aged between 2 and 11 years (6%), and under black (adults 18%, children 16%), but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population.</seg>
<seg id="1817">In single dose-crossover trials of Aerius Melt tablet with Aerius 5 mg of conventional tablets or Aerius 5 mg lyophilisate for intake, the formulations were bioequivalent.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Aerius 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in paediatric patients, but in combination with the dose-finding studies in children, however, the pharmacokinetic data for Aerius melting tablets supports the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years.</seg>

<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years, infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients who cannot swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution to intake, but this cannot be taken along with ritonavir as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Asgenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked the antiviral medicines the patient had previously taken and the likelihood of the virus to be addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg of ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">For children from 4 to 12 years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Aids cannot cure AIDS, but can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Asgenerase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies involving 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug asgenerase enhanced with low dosed ritonavir was compared to other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (virus load) or the viral load alteration after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml as under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced viral load, but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase reinforced the viral load after 16-weeks treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV, which was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, the viral load combined with ritonavir decreased after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agroasis (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amonavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase can also not be used in patients, the Johanniskraut (an herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are broken down just like asgenera and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (alterations in body fat distribution), osteoarthritis (loss of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the self-healing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Agenerase prevailed in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children aged over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Asgenerase is usually taken along with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the Committee noted that the use of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally registered under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited Company for marketing authorisation in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral drugs for the treatment of HIV-1-infected, protease inhibitors (PI) pre-treated adults and children from 4 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Typically Agenerase capsules should be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amponavir together with low doses of ritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amonavir should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amonavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than the capsule; therefore, Agenerase Capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 600 mg Amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenera capsules are used without the enhancing addition of kritonavir (boosters), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of asgenera in combination with low doses of ritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not examined in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age due to the lack of data on the safety and effectiveness (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use should be noted in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Asgenerase may not be used simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and may also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isotherapy 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Plant preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amponavir during the intake of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenera or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy including treatment with Agroasis does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver damage with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">In case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with previously reduced liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased incidence of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of asgenerase and ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolised via CYP3A4, is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is highly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of agroatin with lovastatin and simpvastatin is not recommended due to the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under Monitoring the International Regent Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients taking this medicine at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amponavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives can be altered, but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given with amponavir at the same time, patients should therefore be monitored for oppiate symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propylene glycolate content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be treated with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be reduced to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, the incidence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycaemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases which were required for therapy that were associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemmophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports about an increase in haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and hemorrhosis are reported.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections, leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although a multifactorial etiology is assumed (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width can not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and can also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-Isotherapy 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with ritonavir must not be combined with drugs whose active substances are mainly metabolised via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amponavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the lower plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with ritonavir, undesirable effects on the liver were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amonavir can be brought low by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes Johanniskraut, the amonavirx mirror and, if possible, check the virus load and suspend the St. John's wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if nelfinavir is administered together with amponavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increased, for Cmax on the other hand, reduced by 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, doses of 600 mg Amprenavir were twice daily and kritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% lower if amponavir (750 mg twice daily) was given in combination with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amonavir in plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amponavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amponavir and caletra may not be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">There was no pharmacokinetic study on the use of asthma in combination with didanosine, but because of the antad component of didanosine it is recommended that the incomes of didanosine and asgenerase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice daily) and ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), dosage adjustment is not necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with ovavirenz in combination with amonavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these drugs should be used at the same time, caution is advised as Delavirdine is less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutical plasma level.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and ritonavir is difficult for Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="1977">Simultaneous injection of amonavir and rifabutin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) by rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in side effects associated with Rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in doses of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose, although there are no clinical data available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but the plasma levels of both pharmaceuticals may be increased in case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole with 200 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors, or inductors of CYP3A4, may, if used together with Agenerase, may lead to interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines when used in combination with Agroasis.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that antacids should not be taken at the same time as asgenera as it may result in absorption problems.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amponavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, Nicardipine, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use with Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Riton avir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with ritonavir along with these glucocortides is not recommended unless the potential benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">For HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is highly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected with simultaneous administration of Agroasis.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of this HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined application of these drugs with amonavir is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1991">It is recommended that the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous application of amponavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used along with orally recorded midazolam (see section 4.3) while the use of Agenerase with parenteral midazolam caution is advisable.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other proteaskinase inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam around the 3 to 4-fache.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored for oppiate symptoms, especially if low doses of ritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the low reliability of historical comparisons, there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the amonavir dose if amputavir is given at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agroasis, an increased control of INR (International Regent Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening antithrombotic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods of contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of agenera (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the possible benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactating rats, ampavir-related substances have been detected, but it is not known whether amonavir passes into the mother's milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given amonavir from the embedding in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase in the 12 body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of ampavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2004">The side effects associated with asgenerase treatment were mild to moderate, appeared early and rarely lead to treatment failure.</seg>
<seg id="2005">In many of these events, it is not clear whether they are associated with taking Agenera or another drug used for HIV treatment, or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects mentioned below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1,200 mg. of asgenera twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were assessed by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of patients, as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment (Grade 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and fatheral fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of breasts and dorsozervical fat accumulation (bull racks).</seg>
<seg id="2009">113 anti-virally non-treated individuals who had been treated with amonavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks was only observed one case (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the ProAB 3006 study, 245 NRTIs presented 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 eyes (11%) in 241 patients with indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rash usually were mild to moderately pronounced, erythematous or macroporous nature, with or without itching and usually disappeared during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment having to be aborted with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Cases of osteoarthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) may develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">In the case of patients receiving 600 mg of asgenera twice a day together with low dose ritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable to those observed under some generatase treatment; one exception was the increases in triglyceride and CPK values, which were very common in patients who received asterase along with low doses of ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of an overdose, the patient must observe indications of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Ampavir binds to the active center of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the processing of viral genetic and gag-pol- polyesters with the result of an education unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibin concentration (IC50) of amponavir is found in the range of 0,012 to 0,08 µM in the case of acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of ampavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as in other ritonavir-based treatment schemes with proteaskinase inhibitors - the described mutations were rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral non-treated patients who received 700mg of Fosamprenavir with 100mg of ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to 48 weeks, with 14 isolates being genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolates of 13 of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within 59 patients who had not been treated with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, M36I, M46I / L, I54L / M / T / V, A71V, V77I, V82A / I, I84V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg of Fosamprenavir / 100 mg of kritonavir twice a day: n = 107) of patients treated with protease inhibitors occurred over 96 weeks following the following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Genotypic resistance testing based analyses of genotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62A / C / F / M, I62V and L90M.</seg>
<seg id="2027">Conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended that the current interpretation systems are always used to analyze the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic resistance testing based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies selling diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical-phenotypic cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four, with reduced sensitivity to amonavir associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross resistance against ritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between Amusavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral not-treated patients, in whom a susceptibility to susceptibility failed (one of which showed resistance to Lopinavir and Saquinavir at the beginning of treatment and another against Tipranavir), Darunavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 insulates), quinavir / kritonavir (three of 24 insulates), and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 insulates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Conversely, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits, which can have a detrimental effect on subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study where PI pretreated with ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and nucleosidanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with low-dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one other PI and at least one NRTI were included in the A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis revealed the non-supremacy of APV / Riton avir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-underlined shaft of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of oosteroid drugs is based on two uncontrolled studies with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase's solution for taking and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg was examined twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dosed ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks, approximately 25% of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml for a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the benefits of" "" "untreated" "" "asgenerase should be considered in the therapy optimisation of children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the average duration (Tmax) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2045">The administration of amonavir with a meal leads to a 25% decline of the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amponavir 12 hours after dosing (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous dietary intake influenced the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an unhindered penetration of amponavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active agent in the plasma, with the amount of unbound amponavir which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound amponavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during dosing interval dependent on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, medicines that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 must be administered with caution when given with caution when given at the same time (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily, results in a similar daily amponavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is 14% less bioavailable from the solution than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not interchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal Clearance of Riton avir is negligible, therefore the effect of a kidney function disorder should be low to the elimination of amponavir and ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes lead to amonavir plasma levels comparable to those in healthy volunteers following a dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir twice a day without simultaneously ministering Riton avir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity of mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas used in male animals occurred in dosages which correspond to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) exposure to humans, after twice daily dose of 1200 mg Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of hepatocellular Adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical trials and from the therapeutic application, there was little evidence of the acceptance of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in vitro and in-vitro gene toxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse-lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosome aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes included, was not mutagenic or genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity in patients has been observed in clinical trials, either during administration or after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Toxicity studies of young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality both in the control animals and with the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">Systemic plasma-exposure, significantly below (rabbit) or not significantly higher (rats) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, were observed a number of minor changes including thymus-prolongation and minor skeletal changes that indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenera capsules are used without the enhancing addition of kritonavir (boosters), higher doses of asgenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase Capsules is 20 mg Amprenavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral drugs up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be noted with caution in patients with mild or slight liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that may cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under Monitoring the International Regent Ratio), methods are available to determine the drug concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be deactivated in the course of 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2068">An increased risk of lipodystrophy was associated with individual factors, such as higher age, and drug-dependent factors, such as a prolonged antiretroviral therapy and the associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2069">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC of amponavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="2070">508% increased, for Cmax on the other hand, reduced by 30% if ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was given in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amonavir in plasma, which were achieved with the combination of amponavir (600 mg twice daily) with caletra (400 mg of Lopinavir + 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day), are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if amponavir is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of ritonavir twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amponavir and caletra may not be given, however, a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with ovavirenz in combination with amonavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">When used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as accurate prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and ritonavir is difficult for Delavirdin.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in doses of rifabutin will be at least half of the recommended dose 31, although there are no clinical data available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="2076">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as Amlodipin, Diltiazem, Felodipine, Isradipin, Nicardipine, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, may increase the activity and toxicity of these drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2077">In a clinical study, in which Riton avir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days to subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by approximately 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="2078">With simultaneous application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants together with Agroasis, an increased control of INR (International Regent Ratio) is recommended due to the possibility of weakening or strengthening antithrombotic effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">Simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0,035 mg Ethinyl estradiol plus 1.0 mg of Norethindron) led to an acceptance of the AUC and Cmin of amponavir by 22% or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This medicine may only be used during pregnancy after careful consideration of the potential benefit for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, which was given amonavir from the embedding in the uterus to the end of the lactation period, showed a reduced increase in body weight during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of Agenerase was studied in adults and in children from 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral drugs.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In case of an overdose, the patient must observe indications of an intoxication (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was examined both on acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% inhibin concentration (IC50) of amponavir is found in the range between 0.012 and 0.08 µM in the case of acute infected cells and is 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Conversely, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other protease inhibitor-resistant insulates; maintaining this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on these data, the expected benefits of "untreated" asgenerase should be considered in the therapy optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound amponavir remains constant, the percentage of free active component fluctuates during dosing interval dependent on the total drug concentration in the steady state via the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of amonavir as a solution to intake is 14% lower than the capsule; therefore, Agenerase Capsules and solution are not interchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should, once they are able to swallow the capsules, stop taking the solution to intake (see section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2102">In addition, since there is no dosage recommendation for simultaneous use of Agenerase's solution to intake and low dosed ritonavir, this combination can be avoided in these patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adjustment for amonavir is not deemed necessary, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated in patients with renal failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene glycolate, Agenerase is a solution to take in infants and children under the age of 4, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>

<seg id="2199">Since data on long-term cure rates of more than 36 months after treatment are currently available, other suitable forms of therapy should be considered for superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experience in patients with recurrent and untreated BCCs. therefore, the application of previously untreated tumors is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study suggest that large tumours (&gt; 7,25 cm2) are less likely to respond to imiquimodine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimodine was not examined for the treatment of actin keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data on the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of actin keratoses in anatomical places outside of the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actin keratose on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions frequently occur, but these reactions tend to decrease in intensity during the course of therapy or go back after the treatment with imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause great discomfort or are very strong in the patient, the treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">The data from an open clinical study indicates that patients with more than 8 accesions reported lower recovery rates than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although quantifiable serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) were not quantified either once or after several times of topical use, no recommendation can be given to the application during breastfeeding.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently communicated and possibly linked to the application of imiquimod-cream in connection with side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions at the place of treatment of the aptitude (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">Among the most commonly reported and probable or possibly related side effects associated with the application of imiquimod-cream are complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The side effects reported by Phase III of the Phase III placebo-controlled clinical study of 185 with Imiquimod-cream are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common, probable or possibly associated side effects associated with the application of imiquimod-cream were in these studies a reaction to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical studies with imiquimod-cream were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The evaluation of clinical signs provided by the test plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials with Imiquimodine-cream frequently to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), excreation / dipping / slipping (23%) and Ödem (14%) came (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">The evaluation of clinical signs provided by the study suggests that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with imiquimodine-cream, severe erosion (31%), heavy erosions (13%), and severe shedding and rusting (19%) occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials investigating the application of imiquimodine for the treatment of actin keratose, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental oral admission of 200 mg of Imiquimodine, which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically most severe side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg was hypotonic that normalized after oral or intravenous fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">According to the topical application of Imiquimod, systemic concentrations of alpha-interferons and other cytokines were detected in pharmacokinetic investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2222">3 efficacy studies were shown in 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies showed that the efficacy is significantly superior to a complete recovery of the suitability in an Imiquimodine treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the patients who were treated with Imiquimod the Feignizen cured completely; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">Complete healing was achieved at 23% of 157 male patients treated with Imiquimod versus 5% of 161 with placebo treated male patients (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimodine at five times per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data obtained from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically healed and that remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimodine at three times weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic, not hypertrophic nude lesions within a coherent 25 cm2 treatment area on the scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications External Feignizen, actin keratose and superficial basal cell carcinoma generally do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials on children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimodine n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the dosages examined there (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic intake of the 5% Imiquimod-cream through the skin of 58 patients with actin keratose was observed in the three times weekly application for 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12.5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 pouches) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 pouches).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the two-hour half-life after subcutaneous use in an earlier study, which indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data on systemic exposure showed that the resorption of Imiquimod was low after topical application on MC-sick skin of patients aged 6-12 years and was comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with actin keratose or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity in rats, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study on the dermal application carried out for four months did not show any similar effects.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours in the application.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The appropriate mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimodine only has a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk for the human being to look very low due to systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors performed in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream, earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following are not neurological symptoms of MPS I: enlarged liver, stiff joints which complicate movements, reduced lung volume, heart and eye disease.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyms should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be administered in a hospital or clinic with revitalization devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">In the study, the safety of the drug was investigated, but its effectiveness was measured (by examining its effect in the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthralgia (joint pain), pain, fever and reactions to the infusion.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measure of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and shivers.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyms may not be used in patients who may be sensitive to hypersensitivity (allergic) to the laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review every year all new information that may be known, and where necessary update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyms will observe patients who receive Aldurazyms in terms of the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission granted Genzyme Europe B.V. authorization to transport Aldurazyms across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA-technology using CHO Mammammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, Egg of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme therapy in patients with a secure diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyms should be done by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and for these patients no dosing schedule can be recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effects occurring during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyms should only be carried out in a reasonable clinical environment where revitalization devices are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that nearly all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using Aldurazyme (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience regarding resumption of treatment after a prolonged period of interruption, the risk of hypersensitivity reactions must be cautiously avoided following an interruption of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before starting infusion with medications (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the event of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment should be considered with antihistaminika and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or reduce the infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3) (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with chloroquin or procaine, because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular absorption of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies are not attributable to direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborn babies exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed with Aldurazyme during treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were primarily classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration of treatment up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, observed during the Phase 3 study and its extension in a total of 45 patients aged 5 or older, are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in prehistory, severe reactions also occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing downtime and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Undesirable Drug Interaction in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a Phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe trial form and duration of treatment up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a serum-version was performed within 3 months of the treatment, whereby the patients at the age of 5 years with a more severe expiration form usually came into a serum-version within one month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">By the end of the Phase 3 study (or until early excretion from the study), 13 / 45 patients had no evidence of radioimmunoplecturing (RIP) assay, including 3 patients with whom it had never been released.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG-mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody titers a variable reduction of GAG in the urine was determined.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in the Phase III study and one in the phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic Laronidase activity in vitro that did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or the reduction of GAG in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not seem to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even if adverse drug reactions were typically associated with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for enzymatic replacement therapy lies in one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrata and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate recovery of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Following intravenous infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the lysosomes, most likely via mannose-6-phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyms were investigated in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6-43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire disease spectrum, the majority of the patients were from the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the total distance in the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were recruited for an open label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Aldurazyms for another 3.5 years (182 weeks) each week.</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, the patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and mobility compared to the placebo group, which is shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group, as highlighted in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased proportionally to the growing size of children.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear decrease in the GAG mirrors in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">There was general improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme was studied in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with severe trial form and 4 with the middle course of the course).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- levels in the urine in week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a growth rate (n = 7) and weight gain (n = 3) were determined according to the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe trial form (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with the middle course form had a normal mental development speed whereas only limited or no progress was observed in the cognitive development in older patients.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, investigations were carried out on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyms dosing schemes on the GAG-level in the urine, the liver volume and the 6-minute walk test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks can be a substitute alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information available annually, and if required, the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">Pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of patients suffering from older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not received chemotherapy (medicines for cancer) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body or is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body). • advanced or metastatic "non-small cell lung cancer that does not attack the plate epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, the patients should take a corticosteroid and folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is given together with cisplatin, before or after the gift of cisplatin, an "anti-emetics" (medicine against vomiting) and liquids (to prevent fluid deficiency) should be given before or after the gift of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood count changes, or in which certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, deposed or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of Pemetremixed slows down the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of Pemetremixed into its active form is easier in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of malignant pleuramesothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study involving 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared with gemcitabine (another medicine against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients who were treated with Alimta and Cisplatin lived an average of 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months with the exclusive administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous cell count significantly longer than with the comparison drug during the administration of Alimta.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. to promote the transport of Alimta throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each bottle must be dissolved with a supplement of 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml), resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the piercing bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominantly PCO epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with either a loatally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer except for predominant reticle epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion over a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completing the telemetric infusion on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial carcinoma after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered intravenously over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">In order to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of telemetry, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued during the whole therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last dose of telemetry.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) a week before the first dose of telemetry and after each third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving telemetry, a full blood count should be created before every application, including a differentiation of leukocytes and platelet counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose-examination must take place taking into account the Nadir of the blood-picture or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the anticipated therapeutic cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After recovery patients have to be further treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3 that are applicable to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria are the definition of the National Cancer Institute common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC Grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients develop non-haematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA must be stopped if in patients after 2 dose-reductio- an haematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs or so- continued at the occurrence of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients at the age of 65 years or above, in comparison with patients at the age of 65, there is an increased side effect risk.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose-adjustment was necessary in patients with a creatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a creatinin-clearing of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; 1.5-fold of the upper bilirubin limit and / or transaminase values of &gt; to the 3,0-fold of the upper limit value (with metastases of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored with respect to bone margarnesis and can not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophl count exceeds a value of ≥ 1,500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombo- cyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophl number, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity as observed in the previous cycles of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in the degree of 3 / 4 haematological and non-haematological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was ignored if pre-treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with Pemetremixed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency (creatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous use of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients with a telemetric therapy need to avoid taking NSAIDs at least 5 days prior to the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetremixed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the incidence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For patients with clinically significant fluid retention in the transcellular space a drainage of the effusion before the Pemetric Mixed Treatment is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 serious cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with Pemetritters if this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccine is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive ability by means of pemetry, men should be advised before the treatment mant to seek advice regarding the sperm conserving.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistika (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g daily) lead to a reduced breakdown of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Caution is advisable when high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid can be used in patients with normal kidney function (kreatinin Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetreticle should be avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data concerning the interaction potential with NSAIDs are available with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with Pemetritters must be avoided at least 5 days before the treatment, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the treatment with Pemetre- mixed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring rate of INR (International Regent Ratio) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of telemetry mixed in pregnant women, but as with ande- acid antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected in pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It should not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary and after careful consideration of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive capacity is due to pemetry, men should be advised before the treatment begins to seek advice regarding the sperm conserved.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether Pemetry mixed into the breast milk and unwanted effects on the breastfed baby cannot be ruled out.</seg>

<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetreticle) is an antineoplastic antifolate which performs its effect by interrupting metabolic processes that are important for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetremixed acts as an anti-folate with several targets by blocking the thymidylatsynthase (TS), Dihydrofolatreduktase (DHFR) and glycamidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of thymidine and purulucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomised, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus Cisplatin versus Cisplatin at chemonaial patients with malignant pleural lamide showed that patients with ALIMTA and cisplatin had a clinically meaningful advantage over median 2.8-month-long survival compared to those patients who were treated only with cisplatin.</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are hammered, they cannot break down some fats in the food, causing about a quarter of the fats led by food undigested in the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no weight loss for patients could be observed.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots at anus, flatus (winds) with stage finish, studiness, oily / oily chair, oily secretion (rotting), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It should not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines like warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It may not be used in patients suffering from long-term malabsorption syndrome (which does not contain enough nutrients from the digestive tract) or suffer from cholesterol (liver disease), and pregnant or breastfeeding mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited Company for placing orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with excess weight (body mass index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since orlistat is only reduced to a minimum, it is not necessary to adjust the dosage in the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Primary childbirth (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The probability of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see Section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich individual meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since the weight reduction in diabetes is associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, as the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs needs to be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnancy-prevention measures in order to prevent possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">In a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of orlistat and Ciclosporin a reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">When using Warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick values (internationally standardised ratio, INR) could be affected (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients who were treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K, as well as beta-carotins, remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement prior to sleeping to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see Section4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose of Amiodarone, a minor decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experiments showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are associated with the pharmacological properties of the drug, as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal effects were determined from clinical trials with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) and very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of adverse events reported after the launch of orlistat is unknown, as these events were reported voluntarily by a population of indefinite magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to dilemmas with regard to possible or actual gastrointestinal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the launch of orlistat overdosing, either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on research on humans and animals, a rapid regression of any systemic effects caused by the lipid properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect begins in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bonding to the active serine rest of the gastric and pankatic lipia.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies have shown that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the food fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat taken three times a day in combination with a hypokaloric, fat-reduced diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to baseline (at the time of randomization), was evaluated as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a proportion of those study participants who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although weight loss was observed over 12 months in both studies, the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the total cholesterol was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline: 5,20 mmol / l) and placebo + 2.8% (baseline: 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average amperage of LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (output 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference, the average amperage was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (starting point 103.7 cm) and placebo -3.6 cm (baseline 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measured 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg of orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">In general, no-metabolized orlistat in plasma could be detected sporadically and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study with adipous patients whose minimal systemic resorted dose was administered, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-shaped leucine group), were identified, representing nearly 42% of total plasma concentrations.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Alohxi is used in chemotherapies, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin) and chemotherapies, the excessive trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an anti-emetics).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the drug inhibits the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">In three main studies Aloxi was examined on 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapy regimens, the strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloe showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapy regimens, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with alchema showed no vomiting in the 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 out of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In a comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted approval to the company of Helsinki Biorex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Alopia is indicated for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in case of strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and the prevention of nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of alopia for the prevention of nausea and vomiting, which is induced by a strong emetogenic chemotherapy, can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Because palonosetron can prolong the colon, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of subacute ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients where the QT interval is extended or that tend to be an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, alohxi is not intended to be used to prevent nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, palonosetron did not inhibit the activity of the five chemotherapeutics tested against tumors (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabin, doxorubicin and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single dose of palonosetron and a steady-state- concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">A pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as CYP2D6 inhibitors (anmiodarone, doxorubicin, fluoxetine, cervical, kritonavir, sertraline and terbinafin) had no significant effect on the clearance of Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience on the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects of a dose of 250 micrograms were reported side effects (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with alopia, headache (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the destination (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing experiences.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effects to observe.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were performed because of the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not an effective therapy for alopic overdosing.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double blind studies a total of 1,132 patients who received a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 doxorubicin or 100 mg Dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) were given that was given intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients who received a strong emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine and 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared with patients given intravenously at Day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of trials with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron were comparable to blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">According to the findings of pre-clinical studies, Palonosetron has the capacity to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and to prolong the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The objective of the study carried out in 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in individual doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After intravenous administration follows an initial decrease in plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average temporal half-life of approximately 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportionally in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ / kg in both healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">According to IV administration of Palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the palonosetron plasma concentration between day 1 and day 5 was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg palonosetron reached 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞), which was equivalent to a one-time intravenous administration of 0.75 mg measured value; however, the Cmax was higher after the entry of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which, compared to Palonosetron, have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In-vitro studies on the metabolism demonstrated that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the enzyme enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 mcg / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, palonosetron as unchanged compound made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">In 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance of 53 ± 29 ml / min, the total body size was 173 ± 73 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination diet and the average systemic exposure to palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient for the maximum humanistic exposure, indicating low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 From preclinical studies indications are indications that palonosetron can only block ions in very high concentrations which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization, and can prolong the amount of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded in about 30 times the therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years, resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine Neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal glands) and skin tumors in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined by humans for one-time application, the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C provided for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon is to resemble a biological medicinal product called Roferon-A which is already approved in the EU (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination the liver tissue has suffered damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanin aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormally increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">A yeast is produced in which a gene (DNA) has been introduced into which it stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (drug structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference medicinal product to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after treatment (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: email @ emea.eu.int http: / / www.emea.eu.int / / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non business purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns have been expressed that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed do not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responding to treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was reduced to more patients than with the reference medicinal product; Alpheon also had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from this, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug causes an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine) is not adequately validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected firings (crack or cuts), abrasions and stitched wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used to treat infections caused or presumably caused by methicillint-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alargo may not work against these kinds of infections.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but in patients less than 18 years, the skin area to be treated should not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection had been cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients with Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients under placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin patients, altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together in skin patients, about 90% of patients from both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in treating abscesses (cold-filled cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with altargo (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation to the surface of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the advantages of Altargo were outweighed in the short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections: • Impetigo, • infected small hospitals, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Ltd., a permit for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of a sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of resapamin- ointment the treatment should be broken off, the ointment carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection will begin.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used to treat infections in which MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies of secondary infected open wounds, the efficacy of retinol in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was inadequate.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 to 3-day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected place occurs.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retina and other topical remedies on the same skin area has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not to be expected due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in humans after topical use on scant skin or infected surface wounds (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After oral administration of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazol, the mean Retapamulin EAUC (0-24) and Cmax according to topical application of 1% retapamulin sintment increased by 81% on skated skin of healthy adult men.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosage adjustment is not required if topical retinosinulin is used during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin salbe should only be used during pregnancy, when a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retapamulin is preferable to the administration of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breast feeding should continue / stop or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated, the benefit of breastfeeding should be weighed for the baby and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for women.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections applied to Altargo, the most commonly reported side effects of irritation at the site, which concerned about 1% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of effect Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckerianus (formerly Purotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of reapamulin is based on the selective inhibition of the bacterial protein synthesis by interacting on a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the Peptidyltransfer-Center.</seg>
<seg id="2701">Binding to this binding site, Pleuromutiline inhibits Peptidyltransfer, blocks P-binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s of ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retapamulin at at least some infection forms appears questionable, consultation by experts should be sought.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinamulas against S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-response to the treatment in S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a healthy adult study, 1% reapamin- ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and on scaled skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% reapamin- ointment twice daily for 5 days of topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Samples were taken on days 3 or 4 of the adult patients before the medication and with the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic inclusion in humans after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 Scracked skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng / h / ml) 660-times lower than the retina IC50 for PGP escapement.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinopathy in human liver microsomea was mediated primarily by CYP3A4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies for oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive stroke of the liver and thyroid.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro examination on gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse-lymphoma-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in rats microkernel test for in-vivo examination of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats any signs of reduced fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, whereby an exposure to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 of skewed skin):</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study in rats ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (corresponding to ≥ 3-times of estimated human exposure (see above), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the authorization for placing on the market must ensure that a pharmaceutical vigilance system, as presented in the 1.8.1 of the application for authorisation (version 6.2), works and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the authorization for the placing on the market obliges themselves to conduct detailed studies and additional pharkovigilance activities in the Pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and described in the 1.8.2 module of the authorisation application, as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal products for human use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply any other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo unless prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be applied in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is out of sight on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if ailments occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic zipper containing 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children between one and 15 years of age, who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the immunisation and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be completed.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a susceptibility to hepatitis A or B is desirable, Ambirix or other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines act as they "teach" the immune system (the body's natural defences), as it can fight against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix contains the same ingredients as the vaccination that has been approved since 1996 and the vaccination that has been approved since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, however, in the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses, the three vaccines are administered.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence of the use of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six-month and a 12 month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar to six months and a 12 month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 out of 10 vaccines) are headache, lack of appetite, pain on the injection site, redness, maturation (fatigue) and irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may react sensitively (allergic) to the active ingredients, any of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company s.a. a permit for the placing on the market of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The Standardisation plan for prioritization with Ambirix consists of two doses of vaccination, with the first dose being administered at the date of choice and the second dose ranges from six to twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster shot is desired both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines can be vaccinated with the appropriate monovalent vaccines or a combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HV) antibody levels are in the same order as after vaccination with the monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured that immunocompetent persons who responded to a Hepatitis A- vaccination need a booster shots as protection, as they may be protected by immunological memory even with no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available for the rare case of anaphylactic reaction after the injection of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a quick protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of haemodialysis patients and persons suffering from disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs-antibody-value is reached after the primer-munization, so that in these cases the administration of further doses of vaccines may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since intraorbital injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal result in intramuscular injection, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disturbances, however, Ambirix can be injected as an exception, as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If Ambirix was given in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection at the same time with a combined diphtherie-, tetanus, acellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis and Haemophilus influenza vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the incidence of pain, redness, swelling, maturation, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thiomerisation and preservatives-containing vaccine formulations.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 doses of vaccines were given to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambirix was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and matedness on a basis of calculation per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the placement of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects compared to 39.1% in the subjects after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the subjects received Ambirix administered about pain, compared to 63.8% in the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturation was comparable per proband (i.e. over the entire vaccine cycle at 39.6% of the subjects who received Ambirix in comparison with 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and maturation was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was administered with the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 year-old inoculations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-olds, however, after vaccination with Ambirix, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">Statistically, the proportion of vaccine that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose immunisation scheme with Ambirix or during the 3-dose immunisation scheme with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical studies carried out in Vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the Seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99.1% were one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The anti-HBs Seroconversion rates were 74.2% one month after the first dose and 100% one month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted between 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were given the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was evaluable, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of the 3-tin vaccine than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The responses, which were obtained in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after the completion of the full vaccine series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccines received either a 2-dose immunisation scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalinininactivated hepatitis B virus and 10µg of recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of priming, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected over at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to those detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine, consisting of a total of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study in 12- and including 15-year-olds, it was shown that the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccine scheme compared to the in the 0-12 months vaccine.</seg>

<seg id="2777">The hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foodstuff and beverages, but can also be transmitted through other ways, such as bathing in waters contaminated by wastewater.</seg>
<seg id="2778">You can feel very tired, have a dark urine, pale face, yellow skin and / or eyes (jaundice) and other symptoms that may necessitate a stationary treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix may not fully protect from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccine series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the administration of both doses of Ambirix (although you / your child feel uncomfortable or feel ill at the time of vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">Protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to that of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be mediated.</seg>
<seg id="2782">• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambirix or any part of this vaccine, including neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2783">An allergic reaction may result from itching skin rashes, shortness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue. • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you / your child has a severe infection with fever.</seg>
<seg id="2784">• If you would like to have a hepatitis B protection quickly (i.e. within 6 months and before the usually planned administration of the second vaccination dose).</seg>
<seg id="2785">At the potential risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced amount of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface antigens).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccine of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given a month after the first dose and should give you / your child a vaccination protection before the end of the vaccination series.</seg>
<seg id="2788">Sometimes, Ambirix is injected in people who suffer from severe blood clots, under the skin and not in the muscle. • If you / your child is weakened by illness or treatment in your body's defences, or if you / your child is undergoing haemodialysis.</seg>
<seg id="2789">Ambirix may be given in these cases, but the immune response of these individuals to vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is.</seg>
<seg id="2790">21 Tell your doctor if you / your child take more medicine (including those that you can get without prescription) or if you / your child have recently been vaccinated / has been given / or immunoglobuline (antibodies) have been given / has or is planned in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="2791">However, it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is insufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses.</seg>
<seg id="2792">If another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambirix, it should be vaccinated in separate places and as different limbs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2793">If Ambirix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immunoglobulins, it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2794">Usually, Ambirix will not be given to pregnant or breastfeeding women, unless it is urgently needed that they are vaccinated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B.</seg>
<seg id="2795">Important information on certain other components of Ambirix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to neomycin (antibiotic).</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which has been known since the initial approval for the placing on the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">However, since Ambirix was brought into circulation only in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicinal product is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammosis can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme failure or with hyperammonite encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammosis is - split into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrointestinal lamp (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading hose).</seg>
<seg id="2809">It was not a comparative study since ammosis could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo (a pseudo-drug, i.e. without active agent).</seg>
<seg id="2810">Ammosis may also result in loss of appetite, abnormal acid content in the blood, depression, irritability, headache, fainting, fluid retention, taste disorders or flavor saunas, abdominal pain, vomiting, nausea, constipation, rash, unpleasant body odor or weight gain.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammosis was effectively prevented in patients suffering from disorders of the urea cycle to high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonola was admitted under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "" "because, due to the rarity of the disease, only limited information about this drug was available at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzyme already manifests in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), an indication exists when a hyperammonic encephalopathy is in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium-phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamide-phosphate synthetase or ornithreaded scarpets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine osuccinatsynthetase deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders because there is a risk of the formation of esophagulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2,7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium chloride rate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS therefore should only be used with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and odema formation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium-phenylbutyrate occurs via the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">With subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg) there was a slowdown in neuronal reproduction and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans in breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during breastfeeding (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least an undesirable event (AE) and 78% of those adverse events were assumed to be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktattoo dosis, severe hypokalemia, curb topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">One case of an overdose occurred in a 5-month-old infant with an unintentional single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous dosage of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound, conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine that is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Stoichirically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that, for each gram, sodium-phenylbutyrate taken from 0.12 to 0.15 g of phenylacetylglutamine-nitrogen can be produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve the chances of survival and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifal form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborn was almost always infaust and the disease even led to death in the treatment of peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with its nitrogen-free analogues throughout the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By means of haemodialysis, the utilisation of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium chloride, sodium benzoate and sodium acetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in postpartum (however within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">In patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and which were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonite encephalopathy, survival rate was 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifal form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the ornithreaded scarlet deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonium encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium-phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">It is known that phenylbutyrate is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidney enzymes with glutamine, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined by adding a single dose of 5 g sodium-phenylbutyrate in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, the haemoglobin metabolism and with repeated doses of oral doses up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after intravenous intravenous sodium ylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium-phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">After varying doses of phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day), phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) was not detectable in the next morning after fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium-phenylbutyrate (20 g / day oral in three single doses), the mean Phenylacetate concentrations were five times higher than after the first gifts on the third day.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted via the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus tests, sodium-phenylbutyrate was not treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is either taken orally (infants and children who do not take tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or a gastrodrome or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium-phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in infants, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required in patients who suffer from an early manifest lack of carbamide-phosphate synthetase or ornithreaded scarpets.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium-phenylbutyrate, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium-phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rat-flutes were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), lesions occurred in the pyramid cells of the cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient, who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with Laktattoo dosis, severe hypokalemia, curb topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Stoichirically, phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess fats</seg>
<seg id="2858">Based on studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it can be assumed that, for each gram, sodium-phenylbutyrate can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible even in the treatment, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium-phenylbutyrate in granule form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were detected 15 minutes after intake.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0,95 g, the medium measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon weighing 8.6 g sodium-phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium-phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing, so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must tell the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS, as sodium-phenylbutyrate can affect the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood flow to the heart), for example in cases of unstable angina (a form of pain in the chest with different thickness) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stopping" (abnormal measurement value for electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in the case of some administration or in connection with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another medicine for preventing blood clots) was compared with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often used as a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery in order to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as rituximab und Aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks, or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox in terms of all indicators was just as effective as heparin, except for severe bleeding, where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudin, other hirela, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding, as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the launch of angioxin across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable angina / non-ST uplift) (IA / NSTEMI)) in emergency intervening or early intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angioxin in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is performed in another row, an additional bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">Following clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dose can be taken from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before surgery a bolus of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angioxin in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous bolus of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of any bolus administration from Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI intervention is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt release of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted pharmaceuticals need to be carefully mixed prior to the application and the bolus dose should be given quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subject to a PCI (whether treated with bivalirudin for ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value is less than 225 seconds, a second dosage dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second bolt dose should be checked again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate renal impairment, which were included in phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), the ACT was 5 minutes after the administration of the Biometrudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of unfractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of the subcutaneous administration of Low-Molecular Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to malfunctioning of the haemostasy system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe uncontrollable hypertension and acute bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in patients with dialysis</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with respect to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalirudin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Although most haemorrhages of arterial punctuation occur in PCI patients under Biometrudin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can generally perform bleeding throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taking warfarin and treated with bivalirudin, supervision of the INR-Value (International Regent Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after the treatment with bivalirudin reaches the prior treatment level once again.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the effective mechanism of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregators), it can be assumed that these active agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, clinical and biological hemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental studies are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to Bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the Biometrudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, more than 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleedings were defined according to the ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleedings such as in the footnotes of Table 2.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleedings performed significantly less frequently under Biometrudin than in the groups with heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidin plus GPIIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY heavy hemorrhage was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 4 g / dl with a known bleeding area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding locations which occurred with more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" puncture points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with a bivalidatine in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group and in the comparison groups treated with heparin, more than 65 years were more common to adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy bleedings were significantly less common among the bivalirudin than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects, which are not listed above, were reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped into table 6 according to system organ classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In case of an overdose, the treatment with bivaliruine is immediately broken down and the patient is closely meshed with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and in the anion-binding region of thrombine, regardless of whether the thrombin is in the liquid phase or clotting.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of Bivalirudin to thrombin, and therefore its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin regenerates the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4 slowly, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of Thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, a platelet-induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) was not inducible to thrombocyte aggregation.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Biometrudin shows a dose-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is proved by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was performed in the patients below, an additional bolus of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the procedure should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIb / IIIa inhibitor either before starting the angiography (at the time of randomization) or PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients, which required angiography within 72 hours, were spread evenly across the 3 arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had a recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30 day and 1 year endpoint for the total population (ITT) and for patients receiving aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before the angiography or PCI) are shown in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 An ACUITY heavy hemorrhage was defined as one of the following occurrences: intracranial, retroperito-neale, intraocular bleeding or bleeding in the puncture area, reduction of haemoglobin levels of ≥ 3 g / dl with known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on four-fold and triple-outcomes of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing a PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in Table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angioxicin in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of Bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that Bivalirudin as Peptide has a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent reutilization of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolism resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombine is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombine.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination takes place in patients with normal renal function after a first order process with a terminal half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety issues, toxicity in repeated doses, genotoxicity or reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals after repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks during exposure up to 10-faeces of the clinical steady state plasma concentration) was restricted to excessive pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Adverse events as a result of long-term physiological stress in response to non-homeopathic coagulation were not observed after short exposure comparable to that in clinical application, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2947">If the manufacturing of the ready-to-use solution 17 is not controlled under controlled and validated aseptic conditions, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children aged six and over with diabetes who need a insulin treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or which cannot effectively process insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulipsin differs very slightly from insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter active life than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In a study of 878 adults, Apidra has been studied for type 2 diabetes in which the body cannot work effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study in adults with type 1 diabetes, after six months, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed in comparison with a reduction of 0.14% in insulin lipo.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the decrease in HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% with human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to insulin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission granted Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH approval for the distribution of Apidra throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be applied as a subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to the reduced glucose tolerance and the reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of activity, the brand (producers), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed, etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in the need for insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or termination of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may lead to hyperglycaemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The changeover of a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may necessitate a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the actual profile of the insulin used and can therefore change in the course of change in the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">The substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycaemia belong to oral antidiabetic, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Disopyramid, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, Pentoxifyllin, Propoxyphene, Salizylate and Sulfonamide antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetics such as beta blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidin and reserve, the symptoms of adrenergic antagonisms may be attenuated or missing.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no difference between insu- linglulisine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin delivery exceeds human breast milk, but generally insulin is not absorbed into the mother's milk, nor is it resorbed to oral application.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are listed the adverse events known from clinical trials, grouped by system organclasses and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rarely: ≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: ≥ 1 / 1,000; not known (frequency based on the available data is not estimated).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold sweat, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, dizziness, excessive dogs, changes in vision, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, a lipodystrophy may occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg), given by an appropriately trained person, or by intravenous doses of glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After an injection of glucose, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of the severe hypoglycaemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (in particular by skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that the effect occurs faster with subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulipsin and the active life is shorter than in the normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male individuals aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin delivery in the therapeutic-relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose-proportional glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more than a disproportionate increase in the glucose-lowering effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulipsin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves a complete glucosal effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The data showed that a comparable postpranal glycaemic control is reached in an application of insulin-lulipsin 2 minutes before the meal as with the human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin-lulipsin was applied 2 minutes before the meal, a better postpranal control than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal, was reached.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin-lulipsin is turned around 15 minutes after the beginning of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as in the human normal insulin, which is given 2 million before the meal (see figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-lulipsin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal in comparison to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the start of the meal (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulipsin in 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (figure 1C).</seg>
