package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , by making these easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Set@@ ting up extensions .... Open the card box tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard settings from the package node ; add@@ ons . please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package .
to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; click Tools crashes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if any .
the View Filter module ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be reached in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Tools View filters . with the module you can filter and kon@@ quer@@ or ; the current working directory can be filtered in different ways .
to use the DO@@ M tree view in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the currently displayed web page . as default the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ enta element , all other nodes are sub elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; displays another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory on local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View is to map ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies using a so @-@ called tree map . tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size reflects the size of a file or folder , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then easily detected , if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . thus , &amp; FS@@ View may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX shell command .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rectangle over View color mode can represent either depth for easy detection of ne@@ sting depth or mapping of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property , you can choose whether or not it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space available for displaying , or whether the area of subordin@@ ate rect@@ angles is to be used . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle .
for tre@@ em@@ aps , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . frames are drawn in order to make the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame will need space that will then lose space for the frame if the rectangle is square .
how dividing the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division .
you can specify the minimum represented area for an entry over the menu item View An@@ hold on Area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally was &amp; FS@@ View ; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application .
the picture gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras image gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
when you visit the picture gallery module , a dialog opens which allows you to set the image of the gallery .
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a sli@@ der and a field of rotation to set the number of mini@@ atures of each row in the gallery .
with the box name of the image , display whether the file names are shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
view the file size of the image to see if the file size is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
with the image size check box , you determine whether the size of the images is shown in the thumb@@ nails in the gallery .
in the folder , select where the gallery will be saved and which sub@@ folders should be included .
in the Save In file selection , specify where the HTML page is to be saved .
with the check box to include sub@@ folders , you can set with a sli@@ der or a control panel to which level the sub@@ folders are included .
copy the original images to the gallery and copy the original images to the gallery .
use the comment file check box to specify a comment file for cap@@ turing the images in the gallery .
in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original pictures .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings provides easy access to the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Tools HTML Settings . the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here :
the media playback for the navigation pane can be viewed in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Window Navigation Section or with the keyboard short@@ cut F@@ 9 .
to play , click in the navigation panel of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback .
changing browser recognition adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system identi@@ fiers for individual domains . this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers .
the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options .
changes the identi@@ fier in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser recognition to consult with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail .
pages that do not correspond to the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identi@@ fier of this ob@@ sol@@ ete browser .
this option uses the browser identi@@ fier for all pages of the site you are currently viewing .
with the menu entry ... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in detail .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; module check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ style sheets and &amp; HTML ; -@@ Docum@@ ents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .
check the module website in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; check menu under Tools Site . you can perform the following tests :

an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and get your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ ever ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together with &amp; digi@@ kam .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes a fast image editing with basic image editing tools . you can use this to review , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image plugin interface ( manual ) modules .
although it is easy to use , it provides dozens of professional capabilities . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via li@@ bra@@ m , D@@ NG export and ICC color management workflow .
improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; through the camera or the lens to be searched for .
like everyone &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also digi@@ ti@@ zed ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and improvement possibilities .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to make the report of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides a chat with a under@@ lined link . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you use these links , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . follow the instructions to send your report .
&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage visit to learn news about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ bugs ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ kam is to sign up in the developer mailing list . instructions to announce in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you merge ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter path names or click the folder icon Fol@@ der icon to select a folder .
in the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here the data ab@@ n@@ k is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you would like . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will also use you as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . customize Set@@ ting Up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as a base folder . &amp; digi@@ cam ; viewing every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; thir@@ sty recur@@ sively recur@@ sively the library path in all its depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders unless it i@@ ste in hidden folder . this you can do extra &amp; digi@@ plug ; do this by inser@@ ting a dot in front of the sub@@ folder name .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can join &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Key@@ words to manage your photos in the albums .
raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it may also handle it . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help resource support .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ settings and Ro@@ h workflow sections .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and get your photos directly into &amp; digi@@ ever ; albums can be downloaded . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together with &amp; digi@@ kam .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . the camera is often used as a disk device . the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
digi@@ cam ; uses the g@@ photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital camera . g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras . g@@ photo@@ 2 also supports the picture transfer protocol , a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other periph@@ er@@ als without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . as photos in general are large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with g@@ photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the preview images of digi@@ K@@ am can be reliably read . if the ex@@ if support is not present in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , thumb@@ nails will eventually be unable or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things to do , is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plugin interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ bugs ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way as a user can . their advantage is that it is much easier to digi@@ plug ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes to &amp; digi@@ bugs ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or switch to F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F in full screen mode .
drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere : you can put an image in a different part of the Al@@ ben@@ jar , above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window . the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords , date list or search .
- A file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view . so the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed you can configure in the Al@@ ben@@ Settings dialog .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos taken by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single alb@@ um@@ tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select album Import Images . you can also add a screen@@ shot to an album .
to copy or move a picture from an album to another , you can drag and drop the picture with your mouse onto the target album . in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu .
album collections : are a method to select your albums so that you can group under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos by selecting From Collection from the toolbar or sorting albums Up collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections .
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums Records by date .
buttons El@@ der , A@@ verage , New Year : these set the date on the oldest , newest picture or the average of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the pictures from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last modification of each file will be used in this folder instead .
when you first put an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; open , the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ pi@@ quot ; this shall help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
digi@@ plug ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images will be shown in this album in the image window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fier buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using the Tools menu in the Tools menu .
information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information these are can be edited using Set@@ ting Up Settings ; Set@@ ting up the Albums page and customize the preview images to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . if you leave the mouse poin@@ ter a moment over a picture . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window .
photos are all that it is done with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them . you can reach all the functions that are done with &amp; digi@@ ever ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slideshow or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by either editing either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the right mouse button context menu and Edit ... . in the Edit section , you will find a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view and change your photos .
it can happen that digi@@ cam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . this , and how to customize it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual .
you should note that after processing other image processing programs , it can cause problems with the metadata in the image . some programs do not save these data with when you save the changed image . thus , this information is lost from EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click on the preview and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , you can right @-@ click on the preview and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you retain the extension ( .@@ jp@@ g , .@@ tif , &amp; etc . ) .
if you want to delete a photo , it will be moved into the garbage bin@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Image Del@@ ete or Del@@ ete In case you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del@@ ete .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ p@@ quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the dat@@ as@@ he@@ et below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days .
photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . keywords are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search .
if a keyword is selected , all photos that have been marked with this keyword are displayed .
keywords can be sorted into a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing so , you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned cue within the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . thus , you can also use your keywords in other programs .
you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked on an existing keyword , it becomes the for@@ ear@@ word of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking the cue with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the cue is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it . then a menu appears giving you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time .
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking it and selecting keyword editing in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ; .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos that you want to use with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also right @-@ click on the thumb@@ nails and select cue from the context menu .
you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . this way you can give a cue for each person in a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window .
you can remove a keyword in which you right @-@ click the contex@@ tual menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo .
the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection box that displays the time unit . this will display all the associated images in the main window .
in the field below you can enter a title and save your selection , which will appear in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more in the future .
when you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all the images will be displayed again . if the search hasn &apos;t found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this , you will get a simple search box as described above . however , you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criteria . after you have been saved , it appears filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be executed . the search list will be displayed in the main window in the View My search list . if you want to change your selection after searching , you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you choose to edit search , the form to enter search will appear again with the search information previously entered . if you select to edit as an advanced search , the dialog for advanced search will appear to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete search in the Search context menu .
the Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ bugs ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are added by line , separated by operators . an option can be added to this list by search group / delete group . each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... You can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
digi@@ cam ; characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two signatures , the more they correspond to each other . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ us , the result selection can be enlarged or decreased . if you push a picture from anywhere via the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : free hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ tis@@ ation ; find the matching pictures . also here a threshold can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out or hold it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses your pictures Ge@@ o data .
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L Add the lumin@@ aire from the context menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens . if you are back in the Edit window ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window is visible . if you can select a preview synchronization from the toolbar and perform zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then they are also executed with the other image .
another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you are using pairs of images from the toolbar , then the first two images will be automatically loaded into the realms for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to view it in the right pane . this makes it easier to browse through a series of similar pictures .
of course , the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table , e.g. F@@ 4 file processing ....
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data .
in the bottom end of each area you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can see on the crossed paths . in order to wave the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in mode Pre@@ view both images will show the same image area .
zoom in the same way as in other views . simply use the zoom sli@@ der under the pictures or c@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zo@@ oming out . this happens in both pictures when previ@@ ewing in the mode .
what is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to backup , find , protect and re@@ use photos . here we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that &amp; digi@@ kam ; use . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , filing , filing , archiving , optim@@ ising , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digital Stock Management assumes , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , ass@@ ures , searches , transforms , assem@@ bles and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value . quot ;
metadata is defined as data on data . in accordance with your definition , metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find a certain photo for longer . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use not &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photos should have , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
the rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what types of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image .
we also recommend storing the metadata option in the Edit Settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what happens ? to do that , it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are , of course , the most important ones .
now the real work begins , as you should now assign cue points , cap@@ tions and a rating to each photo . of course you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos when you work .
let &apos;s now start with keywords , keywords like you frequently refer to other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ cam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ kam ; updates as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graphic shows how different metadata over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . file names and calendar data are characteristics of all the images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to in@@ scrip@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
most of you don &apos;t want to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer then start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has completely changed your perception of this panorama .
for others who look at your photos , the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer , to help him understand what you are moving about .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . K@@ DE even provides you a spell ch@@ ecker . if you export your images in web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to your wishes in the lab@@ eling and / or the title of the web @-@ gallery system .
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already travels with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already inn@@ um@@ erable and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographical indications . &amp; digi@@ cam ; can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Google Earth . you can also export the images to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Google Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pr@@ el@@ ude with copyright and design@@ ates the practice the copyright to remove restrictions concerning the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others .
the following description tells you which information in the Setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; should be stored as information :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to add the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity , the name of a company or organization can be used .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author ) : associated with the author . this field contains the work description of the photographer . examples of this can be title : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for providers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others . if the picture is a stock photo , here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections although they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this data embedded in the image . for private persons this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important .
digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
topics : tab@@ le@@ ases , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread ab@@ err@@ ations
of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called new media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the largest data recovery company in the world , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , these must be treated carefully and you may not trust you for a few years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for themselves .
CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write much more reliable . so it &apos;s about choosing the right one .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors even if you have just written . that &apos;s why they use a check@@ sum mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing , ultra@@ violet light , scratches , dust &amp; etc .
for defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently causes miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also applicable to the Blu @-@ ray disc .
read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store them on a clean , dark dry , and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
floppy manufacturers maintain their statistics for themselves . their manufacturers &apos; warran@@ ties include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives for this issue : disk failure study
in brief : dis@@ ks hold the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. At lower temperature the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure . S@@ MA@@ RT errors are the most frequent cause of failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course you can also lose data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electric appliances don &apos;t matter much , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these ab@@ norm@@ alities can cause locked key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware design , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most widespread protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs part of the energy heat and gro@@ unding the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug connector . but remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since there is an over@@ voltage of each cable to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection , which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card .
if you have a not@@ ebook then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for on the go .
while over@@ voltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you with a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore make sense to invest in a un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply .
in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when power failure occurs . some models allow you to store your data and shut down the system . some models allow them to continue working until the current runs . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting .
consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity interference with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can cost you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected by it . finally , you should keep in mind how well your computer is protected with it .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration , you can mount it as a drive on &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home however - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your images in full resolution online .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies offer a backup and distributed storage .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least data integrity between operating system and disk .
the worst part is that no one is telling you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disrup@@ tions remain un@@ discovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are currently not particularly affected by broadcasting problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English .
Oracle started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ f file system . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protective mechanisms using Z@@ FS and is also available for Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss on the not@@ ebooks and 46 % of the workplace systems . in case of lap@@ tops , the share of th@@ ef@@ ts is already 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. th@@ ef@@ ts or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
open source file systems are less prone to loss of data than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . you can find a very good English article here .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : incorrect , only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occurred it is lost .
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology continues to develop , there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go in the direction of 10 meg@@ api@@ xel cameras . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and a high @-@ quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; Euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . therefore , 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . therefore , backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacement of disks or res@@ izing hard drives .
suppose you make every day your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment .
a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane crashes : fire , water , electricity , children and th@@ ef@@ ts are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , disaster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said above is a common reason for a data loss despite security the panic . if you have a backup which is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot at two times : one of the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made . this backup comes closest to an extension system except that it is scanned and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that were actually changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium .
this procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the work files . in the end , you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
themes : metadata , IP@@ TC stored in the image file , retain associated X@@ MP files , original memory , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re @-@ inv@@ ent images and metadata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be followed :
as the future is un@@ predictable on the basis of your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate while time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to assess the questions of the future .
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your photos , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay open standards .
scal@@ ability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing the size of the system .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . for * nix systems like &amp; Linux , you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g whether your new disk has been detected by the system but do not hang it .
&amp; dollar ; dd if = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ h@@ 1 # change the size of rows if needed
open Source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day does not exist any more software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more .
PNG is much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . PNG can store g@@ amma and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment on hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF required and a slow compression . this format we would like to recommend to you to save your pictures .
TIFF has been widely used as image format . TIFF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss@@ less compression algorithm ( default ) . however , some cameras can store your images in this format . however , a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . therefore , there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a ro@@ yalty free and open file format developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obli@@ ges to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it some@@ time .
this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block quot ; technology of the 90@@ s . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to incorporate their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP fits this because it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file , and as noted above , you should consider whether to use D@@ NG as a container and put it all together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . the activities of D@@ C@@ MI include work on architecture and modeling , discussions and collaborative work in D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera service , you can use this as a temporary backup .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
for fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edited and edited the images again , you should add the metadata again , which may have been cut off from the other programs .
protect the edited images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them first in web galleries , code into m@@ peg , use contact sheets , print &amp; etc .
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ ever ; to get . in the Adding a Photo to an Album , you will find a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database .
to use your digital camera , connect it to the computer , connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on . see the manual of your camera for more information .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a Finish indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . some cameras do not display thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol are displayed on the camera for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before downloading the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays the file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
this information is the same as with the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image editing . note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this charges all photos from her camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all photos , you can select only the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download and then download Sel@@ ected . download the Sel@@ ected button until you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an Option New option is available . these images have not been downloaded and edited until now . in this case , the new images are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new images will be downloaded .
when you download the buttons all or download selected files , a dialog will appear to select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and press OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; loads the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you must select them first and then delete Del@@ ete Sel@@ ected .
please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera . the photos are not deleted in the garbage bin@@ s of &amp; k@@ de ; they should be carefully checked before del@@ eting them from the camera . if you want to completely er@@ ase the camera , you should do this using the camera menu , as this is much faster .
the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to double filen@@ ames when you upload photos from different recording studios onto the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was made into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two concern the data about the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the ex@@ if information are copied into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded pictures .
for example , if you prefer a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y % d % H : % M : % S in the editing field . to do so , switch off the date &amp; time option . for further modifications , you should read the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you are using the option camera file names , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case . or in case of capital letters , if you prefer .
the new file name , the digi@@ plug ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera will provide in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform automatic turning during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar metadata , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually switched on , and if your camera does not deliver this information , it can be digi@@ p@@ ated ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window .
when your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was made available , it can &amp; digi@@ cam ; this sub @-@ albums are based on the image data . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is normally switched off , and in this case saved &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to turn this option on . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub @-@ albums at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files you want to upload . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , asked &amp; digi@@ cam ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a generic term in this document . this means a position specified in long@@ itude and l@@ atitude and which can be displayed on a map . the data can be determined by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it may be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that indicates the area . if you want to send a postcard to another , users who want to locate the location of the photos , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the location data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction , saddle and card references . there are at least three ways to achieve this .
as far as we know , there is currently no camera integrated with a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save this data in g@@ p@@ x format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical attri@@ bution .
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and from the GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; make : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Excel Tool from Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the del@@ im@@ ited coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , showing all the navigation data for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many adjustments that the behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; change . to access these settings , you must Edit Settings ; Set@@ ting up . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
select action can be displayed on the saved preview or start image editing . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; note when you click on an entry in the main screen .
this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written to the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also for database synchron@@ isation , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields .
author title is a syn@@ onym for author : this field should include the photographer &apos;s profession . these can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , a freelance photographer or an independent , commercial photographer .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to provide the one who offers the photo . this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associated Press , then these organizations should be registered here because this is the picture of others &amp; quot ; . . if the picture is a stock photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions save the data to the corresponding IP@@ TC @-@ Fel@@ der@@ . this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the digi@@ tization database ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported ; imported without being lost .
save images as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . this allows your cap@@ tions to be read by other image viewers .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor rests over a file in the main window . depending on the selected option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ plug ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify what file types &amp; digi@@ tization ; to show , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list .
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Ref@@ res@@ h button to the right of each category .
some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , you can get better viewing results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the photos shown . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can disable the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bri@@ ghter colour in the picture . these colors are specified here . in image processing this View Mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
with Set@@ ting PNG compression , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast machine , you can set this value to a high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
with the option to comp@@ ress TIFF files , you can switch the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it has no influence on image quality , since the default algorithm works loss@@ less .
with the setting Los@@ s@@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported but was in planning .
in the earlier versions of digi@@ bugs , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image editing settings .
the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light , this difference creates a lat@@ tice pattern in the output . if you use this option , solve this problem with minimal loss of details . this option records the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 lat@@ tice patterns with the V@@ NG@@ - or A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the auto color balance is used .
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the peak lights , so the parts of your images are burned in , due to the inability of your camera to catch the peak lights as continuous white . use the setting through continuous white in the settings .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; nbsp ; and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the un@@ saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
if you select the Rec@@ on@@ struc@@ ting option , you will have the option to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you probably have to set it a little higher than the default 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the digi@@ cam ; image editing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as C@@ FA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for gra@@ dient correction since it is carried out during the conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to return it . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as the color information from one color space to be translated into the other so that the colors are as exact as possible .
behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files .
color Profile Fol@@ der Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; digi@@ cam ; then examine these folders during startup .
settings of ICC profiles You have here the option &amp; quot ; standard chro@@ ot ; to deposit for your profiles . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures color @-@ managed not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conversion at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of profile you can em@@ ulate , as your image would be given back by a device . this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can be very saturated . this could be corrected manually rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . of course this answer is in@@ officially :
the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image Viewer and Image editing . by providing this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , see a list of available modules . select the ones you want to use , and they will then be loaded and edited . these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Quick @-@ instructions .
more information about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained from the K@@ IP@@ I project at ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper sli@@ der adju@@ sts the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display .
on the right side there is a button Automatic detection , trying to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in the picture display mode . below are the port settings . currently , serial , USB and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported .
at the bottom end , you can set the path for USB and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check if &amp; digi@@ cam ; the camera detects automatically . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera &apos;s menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the main window &apos;s menu . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them all here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the option &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confirmation dialog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for moving images in the tr@@ ash bin , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; digi@@ plug ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find further details when del@@ eting a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editorial changes due to the right side@@ bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ ever ; apply if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without any queries . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the Change button .
you can also edit &amp; digi@@ plug the display of the Welcome screen ; this will , under certain circumstances , speed up the start process of &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
the Set@@ ting At start looking for new photos comp@@ els &amp; digi@@ cam ; scan the base folder to new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ cam ; . if something was deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ cam ; you , if it should delete it from the database .
various color schemes can be in &amp; digi@@ ever ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; create , find more information about this in this tutorial .
it can be used to view and edit your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / edit entry .
image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam ; therefore , you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , see the section Image Processing section .
a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , zoom factor , and the current image size .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file save or the Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the picture .
you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using Rec@@ over from the File menu or the button Rest@@ ore the image processing Rest@@ ore in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving .
nearly every action of the image editing can be und@@ one or restored . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting Edit Rec@@ over or Rest@@ art by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you frequently use this , you should make use of the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl , -@@ Z , and C@@ trl ; Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the Res@@ cue or Rest@@ ore button in the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between are also und@@ one or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , picture high , picture down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them .
you can enter and zoom in the photo in which you c@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : select the magni@@ fication factor automatically
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can also edit the toolbar . if you do not want this , you can edit it in the Edit dialog by &amp; digi@@ kam ; edit the main window . see the section to set up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can select Print in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; Print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sentences . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Printer Assistant from the menu Album Ex@@ ports . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the digi@@ cam ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navigation arrows , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five tabs is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented it , use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved .
with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database , but you can also write the metadata into the files , but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images .
the evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 .
the rating is written to the Re@@ gency IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a select box with the keywords mentioned before .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given search word . you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images . if you typ@@ ed different keywords , they are stored for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection , if you want to add a selection with a keyword , please read the keyword Filter section .
the keyword Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - date , keyword and search views is used . if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two will be displayed . all generated keywords are available .
you can also pull and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword is already existing , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection . as a result , a dialog appears that asks you if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three pictures . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Differ@@ ent .
if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry after which is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , specify an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options :
if you want to group options , just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options will then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly adjusted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors captured by your camera or scanner are predictable deviations from the actually photograph@@ ed or scanned colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those origin@@ ating from your digital dark@@ room .
when the topic comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing work@@ flows . the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management .
if your image workflow satis@@ fies all six criteria listed below , you do not have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
their only other educational editions are by email or web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB function so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should you then use another color space and make thoughts about color management ?
a visual example of s@@ RGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all the colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to sound@@ proof@@ ing my monitor if I decided to work only in s@@ RGB colour space ?
yes ! whether you work in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you must be proof@@ ing your monitor , since s@@ RGB means that your ; on@@ it@@ or is on s@@ RGB , so you either need to calibr@@ ate your monitor to the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Rem@@ uner@@ ation and Con@@ trast , Remove from the Cor@@ rec@@ ur Automatic correction to automatically make the best of your colors . you &apos;ll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the fluorescent values over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point is black and the brigh@@ test dot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced .
similar : this method adju@@ sts the lumin@@ ance factor of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes the balance has very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only tr@@ ash . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in an image or it destro@@ ys it .
automatic synchron@@ isation : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram area .
add Con@@ trast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ be of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad pictures .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ cam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly limited there over a color space with 8 bits per color . so if you are too far from the original image areas with over@@ exposed can occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copy@@ righ@@ ted Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you can start it using the Col@@ ors White Balance menu entry .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance , then click on the sub @-@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
the top right corner shows a hist@@ ogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance .
the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow @-@ details of your photos .
to play with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance .
in addition , you can set white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposed indicator enhances the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result displayed in white balance . this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly that . any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and loaded again later .
the Pre@@ ferences tab returns all the filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit encoding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . mapping can be done by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter color management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under C@@ olo@@ urs ton@@ er correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to also store your settings so that you can use them for more photos . this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you will find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar process effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a channel filter .
in times of chemical processing , it was called sab@@ ati@@ er , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er . the colored , dark@@ er areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . the result was a partial neg@@ atives of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine .
the intensity controls the solar movement . at approx . 50 % intensity , the image shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that works ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ire effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it em@@ belli@@ sh@@ es many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ire ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the photo . you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjusting entries can be previ@@ ewed . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce the satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . all changes you can perform can be previ@@ ewed . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool ton@@ er correction is located to improve the exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the range of the sli@@ ders for the purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the sli@@ ders and make sure that the picture changes .
on the right hand side , you can preview the original and preview the image . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left side are the following options available .
sc@@ aling : with this box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
three controllers : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values .
the three color twe@@ ets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a f@@ ading picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later . for this , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ lay In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview pane and it is not visible in the final result .
below is an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) .
the left @-@ hand side displays half of the original and the target image . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right side the following options are available :
modi@@ fier channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and one log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most useful . in this case , the linear mode produces a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will continue .
for example , if you move a part of the curve to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that dark@@ er the image pixels .
on the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see . if you move this marker on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . any curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow , middle and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ lay In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if more than one channel is found in more than one channel , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview pane and it is not visible in the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun@@ shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the digi@@ tization ; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the color channel mixer of the image processing .
with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the image , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are at the bottom right : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color results in a visible noise coming from the far@@ ther . color @-@ bre@@ wing consists of small noise art@@ ef@@ acts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns look different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ lay In@@ dic@@ ator option controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you only get the effect in the preview pane and it is not visible in the final result .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been read@@ ju@@ sted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , since color images can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles .

green Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenery images and fits particularly well to portraits in the sky .
Oran@@ ge@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves scenery , maritime scenes and air photos .
Rot@@ filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar scenes at the time of the day . similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ ph@@ aton : produces warm and medium sounds while adding a little col@@ dness in the sh@@ ading trou@@ ghs . this is very similar to the fate of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ onic . this is typical for the photos of your grand@@ mother and therefore similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) se@@ pi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
using the &amp; digi@@ cam ; applying tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the engraving of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall .
relief : shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified under ( 2 ) to see . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
type : with this parameter , you set the desired frame type for your image . walking through the image with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce den@@ ds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , rounded it with a nice three dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any position . this is also possible in several places when you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; OK . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; use tool sten@@ cil you can put a template across a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu can be used in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template of the digi@@ cam ; template database , just send an e @-@ mail in English to the digi@@ kam ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the default folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings are scheduled for the next start .
after the root folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail .
below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image underneath the template . to do so , take the picture and place it in the desired position .
use OK when you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other fields .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but produces fine gra@@ iny images especially in dark areas .
blur@@ ring mask operates on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . actually , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job here . the algorithm has been taken from Gim@@ p and it is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjusting .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digi@@ ti@@ zing process paints color with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn leads to blur@@ red edges a bit blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when paint spots are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
in JPEG images , a camera has often been used in internal sharp@@ ness . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers are already using a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can call the Cor@@ rec@@ ting Field menu entry .
the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image will re@@ focus the tool . you can re@@ focus it using the Cor@@ rec@@ ur menu entry . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus on re@@ focusing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to shar@@ pen . use the tool to sof@@ ten the picture with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ur sof@@ tness and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration you can see here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . increasing the radius or amount reinfor@@ ces the effect .
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i . therefore , you should best shar@@ pen pictures in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference @-@ amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in order to apply for an edge of the filter . thus areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the blur@@ red mask filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red blur@@ red was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the digi@@ tization ; tool re@@ focuss@@ ing a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is a better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ ming . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focusing often achieves better results than blur@@ red blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing color re@@ focusing in image editing .
in practice , the circular fold operates much better than the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ ate . the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ ate has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical results also from the source pix@@ el@@ ae , which are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Viennese In@@ verse of the G@@ auss &apos;s F@@ ate is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels . this causes unwanted results .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures the default value 1 should result in good results .
correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the filter can accept values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , and eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will further ag@@ grav@@ ate the image .
sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the gauge . use this parameter if your bl@@ ur is &apos; G@@ auss &apos; . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the sharp@@ ness . note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
try to perform all trimm@@ ing , color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module .
otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not visible immediately , but which later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts .
if you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the blur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
in theory , Un@@ sharp Mas@@ king always has to create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lin@@ e@@ are filter .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small un@@ focused picture :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods of sharp@@ ness correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the smooth@@ te regul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink t@@ int allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the in@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pre @-@ settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available Pre@@ ferences are listed below :
if you want to fine adjust the filter settings you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
conservation of details p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smo@@ othing over the picture . whereas larger values predomin@@ ate mainly homogeneous regions and let details sharp . a value of 0.@@ 9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary subsequently .
directional dependence alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed only in one direction . if you have a film size or CCD h@@ iss , a high value will produce wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor above . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ness . therefore , set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
repeti@@ tions : specifies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 suff@@ ices .
angle step size &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is chosen small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles generate a long term . therefore , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs .
integrated step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de length in pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal . it dou@@ bles the running time . therefore , we recommend it to be om@@ itted .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly that . correc@@ ting any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded again later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button .
below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a peculiar black arti@@ fact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) to see and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scanned images from books or magazines .
if you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ windows details and the sub@@ windows Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings .
radius controls the size of the window , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can blur@@ b the image . the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus smaller errors are cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness of the sharp@@ ness . this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to detect light density changes . if it is increased , smoke peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again .
edge : controls the edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur . set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak h@@ iss or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details settings .
g@@ amma : controls the image tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase tolerance values of dark@@ er areas , which are typically rough@@ ened more strongly . however , it also mer@@ ges the shadow areas .
damp@@ ing : controls the adju@@ stability of the phase j@@ itter . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high , the noise and phase j@@ itter will appear at the edges .
save as and load : these buttons are used exactly for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) . noise reduction was applied using the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . fortunately , the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ur sof@@ tness and experiment with the smo@@ othing . the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo .
the digi@@ tization ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to l@@ essen photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche rus@@ hing , film grain , scratches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized pictures .
the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG arti@@ facts reduce : the compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ak@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly that . any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded again later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ en .
the module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera to an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film grain on the faces .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photograph that was read by a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ cam ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows hot@@ pixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem , eight were removed . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos , as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels quot ; &amp; quot ; light Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark @-@ picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
load this file in the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should load the right dark picture to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically load it in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result inside the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all pre@@ views .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixels . these are the filters available :
average : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the broken pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture can be seen under ( 2 ) .
the digi@@ tization ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image .
wide angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , often cannot illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which may increase the necessary sh@@ utter time in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also use a center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or less , as otherwise blur@@ b effects are caused by motion .
with the large exposure ranges of today &apos;s film and grey gra@@ dations of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image without this filter . the tool of vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ ts the transformation with a center filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker .
with three controllers , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ stelle @-@ Filter and with three further the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , you reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it by a small degree .
Bright@@ ness , Con@@ trast , and G@@ amma Settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controllers will only provide you with positive values as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ ju@@ st@@ ment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a lumin@@ ous and contrast correction was also performed on the picture with this tool .
the digi@@ tization ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geomet@@ rical distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool .
the coefficient of the fourth graph correc@@ ts the removed corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated .
in general : this value controls the distortion of the second degree of distortion . negative values can be corrected t@@ onal distor@@ tions and positive values cushion distortion .
this value has a stronger effect on the margins than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite sign of the parameter .
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the image size and thereby leads to a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive the picture decreases .
brigh@@ tening : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the Pre@@ view dialog will illustrate the distortion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start .
the correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . best result in this correction as the first one . if you cut a picture anew and then perform a ton@@ ing correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to fix the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . subsequently , you can correct the ton@@ ing / cushion distortion with the help of the lines .
if you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove them using the trimm@@ ing tool in the Edit menu from the image processing or by the Zoom knob of this dialog .
the next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is shown under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the inf@@ ra @-@ red film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters of film gra@@ ding and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . enable the Add Add Mo@@ vies if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film , especially the green duct doesn &apos;t make sense to apply the effect to black / white photos , as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the more advanced .
the digi@@ cam ; filter film grain is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the movies the manufacturers mix large silver bas@@ kets of the photo emul@@ sion .
the film gra@@ ding effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift into the past . the treated image gets a timeless ambi@@ ance detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , gr@@ itt@@ y sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , set to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you still need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film gra@@ ding effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still lif@@ es are good for this effect .
there are two controls to influence this effect . the upper one sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the mach@@ ined is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the digi@@ cam ; Filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a carbon sketch . the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized . images whose gra@@ dients can change slowly are not ideal for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( fl@@ atten@@ ing ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses an proprietary algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the digi@@ cam ; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is viewed through blocks of glass .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the s@@ und@@ le blocks 1 , the image is distorted by a different version of blocks of glass .
some effects require a long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Be@@ en .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using bl@@ ur effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Zoom : blur@@ red the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sport photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance bl@@ ur : blur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to res@@ ign in the background .
blur@@ ring motion : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : photograph@@ ing from a car or train , camera .
blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ bs the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and brilliant soft focus effect ( Hamilton Eff@@ ect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
vibr@@ ating sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image by a random shift of pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color font in the picture and blur@@ bs it without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divi@@ des the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require a long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load . you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Be@@ en .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your images a wet look . it uses an algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops .
you can use the Edit tool to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . once you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be found in the Edit menu or Trans@@ form Sc@@ anning menu .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re @-@ inv@@ ent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the res@@ ize size in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
change the tool to size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to increase an image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ate was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the new tab , and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : when this setting is activated , the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; Tur@@ bul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 .
the Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . enlar@@ ging any background for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded again later .
infl@@ ating photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Be@@ en .
you can see below an example of picture infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison .
cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a picture you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rectangle . you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off . this gives you a good overview as your photo would look like after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rectangle .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the Save or Save File menu under the File menu to save the newly cut picture .
in the preview area , you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained .
in the tool After aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or landscape format . in portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width are assigned .
cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you are cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog , there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog , you can use the Max . ratio button to set the area for cutting to the wid@@ est possible , depending on the selected ratio and orientation .
when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cro@@ pped image and not the original image .
the context @-@ help settings allow you to blend support so that you can put your pictures together better . these help are :
harmonic triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ bow , harmonious tri@@ angles are a way to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic tri@@ angles at the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number deri@@ ves from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious .
the golden center provides liquid help lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third @-@ hand gel , the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the observer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this kind .
a further rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . these rect@@ angles are used to defl@@ ect the golden spiral . there should be something that the eye can diver@@ t to the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diagonal to these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic .
if you use gold tri@@ angles to break up your frame , you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise .
the horizontal mirror and mirr@@ oring options can be used to mirror the harmon@@ ics .
with the button color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the help lines can become invisible . this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy to keep the camera vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ cam ; image editing and the tool free rotation . to do this , select Trans@@ form Free Rotation and adjust the target angle .
rotate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this slide are indicated in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences knob , you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after you have moved it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous sections .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to fix this is to use the function Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ ases option fl@@ atten@@ s the image a bit after the rotation . but be aware of the above warning .
all perspective trans@@ formations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
new Wid@@ th : displays the width of the new image , including empty spaces created by transformation in pixels .
new height : shows the height of the new image , including empty areas created by transformation in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees in the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees in the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle Right down : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after adjusting the perspective you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing .
the tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction . for example , a horizontal string will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . in other words , a rectangle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module by transforming scissors .
shoot your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect is displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
for your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your picture .
after you have done the she@@ ar , the image becomes a bit blur@@ red . for a single she@@ ar this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two activ@@ ations are twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after lubrication the picture has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled .
due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of any file formats available on their system . however , they will always find JPEG and TIFF there@@ under .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; shows only files in formats that are familiar with . this is done using the file extension and comparing them with a predefined list . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in the editing pane will change ; you can change this list of file extensions that &amp; digi@@ kam ; accept .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images . in doing so , redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store loss@@ less when it is specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read under Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF to the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam ; you can find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
there are more than 200 raw file formats supported . all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats from &amp; digi@@ kam ; supported :
many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in options to view or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playback .

if you exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was already very good , then you can do the first four alignment with the White Balance module .
many tools you need to edit the photo editing are included ; your description will follow here .
all image editing tools like sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tening , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , un@@ sharp mask , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialog box that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture application quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview region . these modes are :
vertically divide without dup@@ licate . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower for comparison the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ M@@ ouse over &apos; style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to display over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module will be noted .
the side@@ bar features the essential information about the selected image and is mostly self explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo features : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or out or hold it with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to move a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . of course , this pres@@ upp@@ oses your pictures Ge@@ o data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the Pal@@ let files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can apply either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; Settings and Hot Custom color and last used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pal@@ ettes or browse the folders according to the files .
the cursor is displayed in the Pal@@ let view as a line . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
it can also be used for selecting . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check@@ box when the cursor is selected under the Add Color button , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different one ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character if another color follows . if three figures are in the clip@@ board , they can be past@@ ed as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ fully ;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program used to view &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are used in science , especially in computer science . so far there has been no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graph@@ s . the programs that include &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z , are out@@ dated &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with just a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s ; graphics &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; displays graph@@ s with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; re@@ comp@@ utes the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; represents )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
load large graph@@ s ( currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a h@@ ack to represent more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for representation of graph@@ s . in detail :
the main window displays the opened graph@@ s , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , when you start &amp; k@@ screen viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list En@@ ables opened files . click the first icon to open the dialog file .
after selecting one or more &amp; dot ; selected files , the main window looks like the screen@@ shot below :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right at pressed &amp; alt ; -@@ key ) ;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by the factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
if the currently loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; can also mem@@ ori@@ ze your decision , so that later it will proceed as well . if you want to change your decision later , you can configure the menu item Settings c@@ viewer ; Set@@ ting ... , see also .
when you open a graph@@ ene file outside a running &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; instance or want to display the graph@@ ene to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog subsequently .
when you start the program , you can open all graph@@ s of your last session again . again , you can save your choice as well as change it later .
you can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely .
if you are using multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page are to be fitted to this page . the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled in by the respective parts of the graph .
page preview with a single page distributed on several pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Load page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore changes ) or consult the program each time .
the Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session . you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or specify that each time is requested .
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical viewer ; you can set a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or to be asked at each start .
the context menu , which usually appears at a click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up additional options :
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graph@@ s . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered represent@@ ations of directional graph@@ s . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overl@@ aps as possible .
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ eri@@ zed graph@@ s . it produces represent@@ ations according to the spr@@ ing@@ time model . the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is equivalent to statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP algorithm generates a spr@@ ing@@ board model layout for peripheral graph@@ s . it uses the fru@@ c@@ tose @-@ pure gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ point trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ s .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm places the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then run from a shell . the command should accept the Gra@@ ph file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can give special options , or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type to ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for non @-@ directional graph@@ s ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main toolbar , the toolbar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the icon .
create a new icon . if the current file has been modified , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears in which you can choose whether the icon should be created by a template , or whether you want to start from scratch .
restore the last rever@@ t . if you did not make a step backwards , this function is de@@ activated .
adds the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in gray scales . this can create colors that do not match those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de .
does not change the icon , but sets the current character color to the color of the point you click .
the status bar displays the current actions . from left to right , it displays the x and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current drawing area , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol .
adds the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and symbol grids .
with buttons Add ... , Edit ... and remove , you can change the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and store new images .
this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
when you scan the menu item , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears where you can replace the default duc@@ er &apos;s default values to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner .
make sure that the window is completely displayed , since some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image will appear . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
screen@@ shots can be created after you have selected Import &gt; Screen shots in the menu . a window appears where you can set different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select Full Desktop to read in to read a single window under the mouse .
if all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work areas , you should select this delay up enough to have the time to navigate there .
after the screen@@ shot has been made , the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r makes it possible to send photos to the people who are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world , put photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication , so it is virtually your link to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so that you can login with Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r web page . the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section .
if the module exports to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module displays . to upload , you need write permissions . the module does not currently support other permissions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions .
the button to add photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . if you press the O@@ k button starts up@@ loading the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
the Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie options allow you to set the permissions to your images . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you select the change option to change the size of the photos prior to upload , the photos will be changed in size before up@@ loading .
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . the size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery Export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Gallery export has no documentation at this time . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographical loc@@ alization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographical loc@@ alization module provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and enter the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to allow a possible correlation between time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken back at the same time , as the pictures of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera connection must be converted with GMT . this can be done with the time zone . set your camera line here .
the maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds .
if you have no trace data from a location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these boundaries here and press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog box is marked by a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and placed with the displayed map . select the region and enlarge it .@@ Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and a mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ tool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded by U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted . the Ri@@ der Sel@@ ection allows you to select all the albums to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right side allow you to quickly select a large number of albums .
the tab theme defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is mostly self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show
the tab defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images . select a folder where you will have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ X@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will be saved in the new images as well .
set the default color depth with Other color depth , which of course affects the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , that are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window displays the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I Viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Viewer View Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality .
this module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata .
the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found for example also in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I Digital Camera Client has no documentation at this time . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org mail@@ ing@@ list for the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function . it then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to select the destination image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write to any target format . JPEG is supported in writing . please check out ex@@ i@@ v2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ dec Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the module MPEG Co@@ dec can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module will use the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also insert a basic image transition between the individual images . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slide show .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show . afterwards , you can create the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio , where you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list .
after you are happy with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you &apos;re planning to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is specified below . a low value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth image change .
the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file using the name of the m@@ peg output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible .
if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adapted all settings to your wishes , you can start generating the movie with the button encoding . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now go for a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow once you are back .
if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of the M@@ jp@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages by button Settings right below .
the print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened using the Image Image Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or to print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your RAW files to one of three JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM formats .
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from it is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w ! .
first select the raw file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can further process the image later .
a 4 @-@ color R@@ G@@ BG Con@@ version can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image format , TIFF , retains all the information of your image and uses loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them , you should not choose JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteri@@ or@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data .
if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch editing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files automatically . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the convert program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all pictures of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can res@@ ize or enlarge the image . to do so , four types of image change are provided :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . for example , you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format .
not Pro@@ por@@ tional : not proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing preparation : prepares the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adapted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
after you have started the module , the image window will display the images you select . using the Add Images button you can add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview is displayed on the right side .
you can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent .
with the Button Images , the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you only need to add the addresses and the subject . the selected pictures are attached as attachment .
don &apos;t mind sending too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations on the size of the emails to be sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it .
select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats like TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG to JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original image data will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window appears with questions like you want to display your slideshow . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the option Open@@ GL @-@ transitions in the presentation activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the File Name option will show that the filen@@ ame of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually inter@@ rupt the presentation with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album .
the distance between the images can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . you should check this before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects another effect .
during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop and start the presentation , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date does not currently have documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. Please note : participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I Back@@ ground picture is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
once you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; Browse these , see image . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , now in each group , thus in people , places and in the group keywords are available .
in the browser window , you will see the categories for which you typ@@ ed information as you have provided your images and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries for looking for EX@@ IF @-@ based information , viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumb@@ nails . in the following each is described for itself .
if you click on the entry with the mouse , the view of the browser changes . see image .
if you select another person , only the images on which both persons are visible are displayed . through this selection method , you can restrict the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few individual pictures .
if you have selected all persons , locations and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity .
in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own preview image , which of course also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself . see the picture .
in order to display images next to the names , select the button located on the right side of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you need to specify which image to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the picture @-@ view window ( in more detail ) and select the entry categories editor in the context menu . now you can customize the image for the respective person . in the view window , you can customize the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off .
if you visit the Find item in the main window , a dialog will be displayed , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog again on the image .
if you enter a string into the cap@@ tion or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to look for ; the date can either be part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options at the bottom of the window you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture . click here for images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Her@@ ene are depicted .
this is the User &apos;s Manual for &amp; photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather want to try out functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shots and introduction videos .
start &amp; photo@@ album ; and select the demo in the first dialog , if you start &amp; photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select the menu item c@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ Demo . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; try .
if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database .
the tim@@ eline can show you several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between the units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed thumb@@ nail view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview pane ) and also the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select an area of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , only images of this period will be displayed in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create through the menu File HTML ... .
before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas : content , Layout and Location . in the following , each area is described in more detail .
first , enter the title of the overview and a description to contain the HTML file later . on photo album ; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings .
next select whether a photo album ; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information to display on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed , which are obvious to the viewer , even without a description . for example , that all images are from a party . note that all images are currently exported . you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers .
in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed .
at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images . this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so , it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area , you specify the different folders and URL where your website is stored .
for all your HTML files , select a base folder and create a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent sentence .
first you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to the viewer . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will start after the pages have been created . otherwise , the URL you specify should be the folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them to it . in order that the import function , see , correctly works , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the settings described are all three related to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders .
if you are coming together on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; photo@@ album ; you can , of course , create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the picture information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . , then you have to go with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not make this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file contains only one short@@ cut to images . the advantage of saving all the images into the file is that you have all the images together and can pass that file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , it will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file folder . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file with the HTML export .
the following is the dialog for ex@@ porting images that you can export through the File Ex@@ porting menu .
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Manual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; option , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with option Automati@@ cally copy &amp; paste photo album near the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most of the images were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , just choose the export file option .
the last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size . if you send images to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
when you import a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; import the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folder the import images should be copied .
it may be that you are the category people of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) while this category is named for your database . therefore , in the third dialog window , you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database .
in the fourth step , you can match the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example can be seen on the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view pictures : if you look at images , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you look for example pictures of your holidays and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) Set@@ ting up the information on your images , via ( 2 ) browsing and watching , up to ( 3 ) advanced themes and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ Album has been started as a program for managing your pictures , but it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual you talk about pictures , but frequently this includes videos with one .
&amp; photo@@ album ; saves all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of its images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want .
&amp; photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your pictures are stored and automatically re@@ use it in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . for example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml .
over the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; Set@@ ting up ... get to a window that allows you to change the settings of &amp; photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will be able to explain the various settings options .
on the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want .
it describes how you can define different properties for each picture , e.g. people , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol .
in this section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list of options listed above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories .
&amp; photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface .
the modules can be accessed via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can call through the module itself .
since the modules are used by multiple applications among each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own images . you can either use the command line with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . don &apos;t say I didn &apos;t warn you !
the applications that the modules use together with K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the down@@ side when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I is that the other applications are just a folder . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this kind of order does not support , it simul@@ ates the order for albums for some modules , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ album .
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view , i.e. all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment .
next to the current album must be a photo album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here &apos;s a photo album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do , so if you selected persons to view and share this with the module .
since some modules are with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the settings dialog and select modules that you want to load modules .
on the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a photo album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used to with any other K@@ DE application , you will see a menu and toolbar at the top . below the toolbar , you will see the window that you have entered into your image database . in the section , we will return to this window , but first click on the entry images that will show you an overview of all existing images .
one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ album ; is the ability to provide any picture with notes . this includes information about the persons on the picture where the picture was taken , etc . you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if , for example , on all pictures Jes@@ per is m@@ apped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting individuals , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ album ; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images .
the following idea is based on moving the images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 people , you can , by moving the names used up , to find and assign people faster .
if you prefer to see an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click the Sor@@ ting icon by date below the list .
if you have selected notes for each image individually , you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments to these images . in this case simply click on the before and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the upper right .
if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a comment .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California .
on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed .
in the Comment dialog context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category or sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag and drop an entry into a category to make it an sub@@ category of this entry . note , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame . you can also make a separate window from a frame by dra@@ gging it outside the window area .
if you have adjusted the appearance of the window to suit your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... that provides you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window .
you can also completely hide a frame . if you want to get this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide / hide windows . you can see this process in the picture .
if you select Show images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you have not set a filter . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . just try it .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete selection from the Edit menu . now the window will appear to you that you can see in the picture .
&amp; photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely images even without having to store them on your hard drive . of course you must have saved the pictures somewhere , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can view the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images where the right upper corner is cli@@ pped are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album can show you the preview of these images . however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer .
as you can see , this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &amp; photo@@ album ; do not support you until now to ask you to insert the corresponding CD . so , if you want to avoid anno@@ y@@ ance on how to avoid m@@ ashing your images , please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it .
in the View menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you would like to have a little more privacy , filter the pictures so that at the end the ones you would like to make available to others and click on Current View in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also select all the pictures that your little sister can see , and choose the menu entry Any except current view .
with this you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the item entry images , so that all the images you have locked will be hidden . if you want to get the pictures again , click lock .
it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the Privacy Tools menu .
please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , anyone who can access the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file can read or delete the password as an un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; photo@@ album ; not very familiar looking at private pictures .
the reason you share all your pictures with &amp; photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course that you want to consider them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; photo@@ album ; using a picture _ and video viewer . this you can start from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered into the picture , e.g. who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc .
if you want to see the info box on the top of the image you want to see , you can simply drag and drop it with your mouse . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is to be displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser will show you matching entries to this . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . &amp; photo@@ album ; loads then a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer from &amp; photo@@ album ; is it possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom into the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply move a rectangle with the mouse . with the minus key , you can zoom out the plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zo@@ oms .
with the dot key , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not displayed zo@@ omed . using the uni@@ formity button sets the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key .
with the scripts from the context menu you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make ann@@ ot@@ ations to the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu .
if you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can cancel the view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . however , you may prefer to select only the image and view more images .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad , while you look one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in this view you can see a picture in which the characters A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have features on your images , these are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you are editing , printing or whatever selected , you simply add all the images that you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can view categories in dre preview view , you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the characters for the feature after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . in this case you are allowed &amp; photo@@ album to paint on the picture .
the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . in this way you can und@@ o your painted later .
in , you can see a picture on that was drawn . to activate the drawing mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the image from the context menu . to end the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to use the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully control , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; should you have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wi@@ re@@ frame views are shown in yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time . but not the object of an object already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are multiple possible positions , the following pull @-@ down menu opens , so that you can choose the correct position :
you can delete selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu bar or the right mouse button context menu .
if you have changed properties , click Apply to Apply these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view .
press Pre@@ view in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render a sub@@ ordination element . if you only want to render a part of the texture map ( for example , a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , check box locally .
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only when selected or their level of view is smaller or equal to the stage of view chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window order or if you need another arrangement , you can set them as you like . you can also store multiple windows orders and simply switch between different orders .
to anchor a window above or under a view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rectangle will then display the new position .
to create a new column , drag the button to the right or left side of the view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height .
if you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other , drag the finger in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between the views by clicking on the index tabs at the top of the views .
the last possible window order are floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to resolve a view from anch@@ oring , drag the finger on the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing upwards in the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross at the beginning bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can add additional views to the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them anywhere .
the current window view can be saved with View Window System . it displays a dialog where you can store the window order under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 current . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ ders icon in the toolbar , or select the Ren@@ dering menu item .
a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the Def@@ l@@ settings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu View menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it makes sense , but a name that lets you see the properties of the mode .
in the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the image , select the crop section sub@@ section and enter the image section to render in the input fields .
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used to render . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details will not be displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculate and connect &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . the default is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive , because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated color values .
if you choose the first method POV @-@ Ray tracks a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then :
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , the pixel is split into 4 sub @-@ pixels , which are pursued individually and are checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you turn on J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last adjustment for the quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays hit no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for this here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , select the Import menu item ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the full command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import , write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ w@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this inserts the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects into the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source code for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . set the path to your document and version here . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example , height @-@ field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; Li@@ br@@ aries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also add the path to these files here . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used to display the selected control points .
the color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identi@@ fiers .
you can set the object capture of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ frame views . here you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions .
if you check High details for extended projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections . this property results in better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render .
when displaying a wall , a wall is rendered behind the objects . the wall is represented in a chess board pattern in two adjustable colours .
when you tick the ground , a floor below the objects is rendered . the floor is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern in two adjustable colours .
if you tick the edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can set the values for depth and threshold value . more exact information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ modes section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window instructions section explains how to create and store window orders .
drop down sel@@ ector Panel : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window order when starting the program .
the List Exist@@ ing Window System displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and del@@ eting a selected arrangement with the Remove button .
each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all the views for the selected window order . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button .
the position of the new window . with New column , you create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with tab card you will get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and floating does not anchor the view in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you just have &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before compl@@ aining that you only get a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied for rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture .
if you have installed all error @-@ free , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following default window order :
take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first have to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select Del@@ ete from the menu item . you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the scene view from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view object properties in which you will find the different parameters of the camera . see the user documentation about &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; see further details .
do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera &apos;s target point . just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location .
pressing the Apply button or the Enter key will change the wi@@ re@@ frame views and the object tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s point of view .
there are many ways to create the floor for the scene . you could , for example , insert a header ( insert final body qui@@ vers ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method to solve this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key . the new name will be displayed in the object tree immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the plane , al@@ beit at the moment just as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon .
if you look at the object tree carefully , you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor by clicking on the + in front of the object . in this case , you will find only the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the property properties .
in this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and adjust the values as follows :
first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment .
in both cases , a dialog opens , in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = ground @-@ pigment ) , with a click on the preview button you can see how the pigment looks now .
of course , the preview of the pigment is just a matte black material because you have to re @-@ enter settings for the pigment . always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and bul@@ let in the preview window , just click on the Apply button and then enter the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now by clicking on the icon , you should get the following result :
in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the Item Tree you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ ochro@@ me and change the colors in the view of the property properties :
you should be able to do this step by simply because you should have understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can just be created just as easily as the ground :
in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( Don &apos;t forget to press the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course , rendering now gives a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the following step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as on the ground , give the sphere a pigment as color :
select the first object and change the name for example in sphere of pigment . click on the sphere pigment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click Apply or press Enter .
the settings gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ mium @-@ plated surfaces , even when metallic : not even selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modelling ; offers . hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ trac@@ ing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a 3D scene or model .
if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en a scene , the ren@@ derer sho@@ ots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects , the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect .
as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you don &apos;t see anything , the picture is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog , you can select a file that you created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a storage space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last command you wish to rever@@ t . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Un@@ do .
saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or over@@ write an existing order .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; here you can change the look , short@@ cut and default behavior .
opens a dialog for modi@@ fying the keyboard short@@ cut . you can modify or add new commands to &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option ; modify or add new commands .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; commands .
a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color card .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ fic show ; it is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display with Click the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the lower right corner . if a matching file name has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in Di@@ alogue Set@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ fu show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the way of working &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts for the respective windows can be specified .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color , which you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
this point activ@@ ates , loads &amp; balls show ; already the next image in the folder while still watching the current image . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is especially suitable for slideshow .
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ k show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ k show ; this folder in the browser window .
click the colored bar to select a background color . it is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in Window mode the window is bigger than the image , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ fic show ; set up that only a few of the file types are displayed that can display the program as well .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slide show should begin with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
to change the value , you can enter a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds .
if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 1 .
here you can change the short@@ cuts for the various operating modes of &amp; ku@@ fu show ; in the flash@@ cards , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .

&amp; show@@ shot ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user contributing his part to reporting at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ casing ; make it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu includes an entry reports you issues or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use this , your browser will open a page to reports of problems and wishes .
&amp; show@@ casing ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a common user of &amp; show@@ shot ; then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of &amp; show@@ casing , but we hope soon to answer any questions of other users .
the best start to join &amp; show photo ; to participate , it &apos;s the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list from &amp; show@@ shot ; .
&amp; show@@ shot ; tries to give you as much control over his work processes as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ casing . to access these settings , you must select in the menu Set@@ ting show photo ; Set@@ ting up the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left .
in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposed indicator was selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should contrast the colors with what you are supposed to display , in contrast . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color .
the main window of &amp; show@@ shot ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is also available in the image editing . you can view them by clicking on one of the five tabs :
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images that no longer does as images to scan and save .
&amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that no longer power as images to scan and save . &amp; err@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving for each image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set in the terminal at the command line . if this scanner is not open , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog to select the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; err@@ l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not particularly handle these options .
in order to scan an image , the user can start a pre @-@ scan and then scan for the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zo@@ oming out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the complete preview will fit into the window .
once the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the Scan button .
when saving a preview in the settings selected , the image will appear in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you will get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the dialog of the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if wished , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; channel ; save images . open dialog for saving for each image opens the dialog in front of each scanned image . if &amp; chan@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically save you with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select saving without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save As option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , this folder will be used as the default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change it with the button ... .
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images that are stored automatically and is also the suggested name for the image in the dialog for saving . the automatically saved image gets a numerical suff@@ ix each time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality that is used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Button Help starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ Hand@@ book . the Button Over starts the K@@ DE dialog for &amp; S@@ quar@@ ite ; . the Settings button displays the dialog for the Settings and C@@ lose can be used to finish &amp; check .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like any other keyboard short@@ cut . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and selecting Global keyboard short@@ cuts you can set up by right @-@ clicking in the player window and setting short commands ... Select .
you may set existing multimedia keys to work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands work , making your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control center .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many common functions , most of which can be found in other K@@ DE applications . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P features of collection , context browsers , players , playlist , play@@ lists browser and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some of its own command line options .
you should give the user a feedback if the script can &apos;t be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script if all required modules are present and use k@@ Dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run .
add require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ Dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow exec@@ uting external programs and commands . for this purpose , the ex@@ ec ( ) function is usually used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events if there is no use for it .
configure The script to show the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok converts the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored .
track@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is being played . the script could now &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ CO@@ P functions , queries can be retri@@ eved with more information about the new track ( such as the metadata or the piece length ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Min@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a custom menu item can be identified . to add a custom entry to the menu , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) to remove an entry .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed , for example to do cleaning operations . this includes , for example , saving of data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the cat@@ aboli@@ zation amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should ren@@ ame your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can hang it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; script .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music to the playlist , rather than having to go through endless menus . you may also search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Coll@@ ecting Browser and Quick Search , you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have a few play@@ lists , but can you never decide what you want to listen to ? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so you can choose how to listen to your music . Amar@@ ok is smart , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re @-@ experience your music !
usually , you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no trouble with comp@@ iling . if you encounter any problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script . this is a list of available options .
certain dependen@@ cies need to be met for some of the comp@@ iling options for them to be used . see the System Requirements section for details .
enables debu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without difficulty using the setup dialog . the Setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is disabled , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar , the option to@@ ggles the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
make it more atmospheric : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ o@@ do@@ bar . this modi@@ fies the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
drop voice files on the music files : this function is only available , when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the corresponding music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start when a browser is needed .
use other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser that is not in the list above .
saving play@@ lists when closing , automatically stores the current playlist when loading &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you do not want to lose the playlist upon completion .
relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , will use . otherwise , the absolute location of the music files will be saved .
keeping up @-@ to @-@ date piece when changing the piece causes the playlist to roll up / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
switching to the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s App@@ ear@@ ance . the section is divided into three parts .
in the Fon@@ ts section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; use the otherwise gra@@ yed section by selecting your own fonts . you can select fonts for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . press Select ... , so you can select a font from the selection dialog .
with the Custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector enabled for foreground and background color .
resume playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after the program start , the play will automatically continue with the piece at the place with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shade causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
using your own colors gives you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces will open the color selection dialog . if your own colors are not enabled , the default colors will be used .
the Display Text entry field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify the screen of a multiple monitor environment to appear on the O@@ SD .
the audio output card card lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers still activate additional settings in this card board .
the card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection , including the folder and the type of database for the collection .
here you can select the folders that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders will search for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . additionally , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import Play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok to add all found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection , and the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is required in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then you enter the network port in which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the debit card last@@ .@@ f@@ m provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations for the current part if necessary .
enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send played pieces and update the profile : this setting allows &amp; Amar@@ ok to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
call similar performers : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; get a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the played piece . you can see the list in the context browser . note : you don &apos;t need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs it contains , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them , e.g. modules or scripts ) .
some features such as O@@ SD require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause problems , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t because they provide an excellent development environment .
you can locate the file by hiding in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash .
most of the time , it is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database then try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if , for example , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b has been compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this will crash when processing met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then turn off automatically when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark them as Uni@@ code . the following per@@ l script fixes the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; File $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error when writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s icons in the Status Bar ( Rand@@ om Mode / Rep@@ eat / Dynamic Play@@ list ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can simply forget the icon effects . you can sometimes click on a icon in the Control Center . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect .

to fix this bug , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version , or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
most installation problems are solved most easily by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or the developers . use the forum and IR@@ C at ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please only make a mistake there if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come into there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the startup sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Tools statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars represent the rating by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to rate pieces , the rating column needs to be displayed in the playlist ; click the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new rating column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this will also work if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or right click on your selection and then select From playlist to remove from the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse to the playlist and drop it there just as you would do with other files too . that &apos;s how easy it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , next to the Add button , you can save the Play@@ list button . click on it .
probably you are missing the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config program . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ audio@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ zations .
the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it using the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be What media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much any imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which in default does not supply MP3 deco@@ ders ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat , mp3 k@@ de , Enter key
launch the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; play MP3 &apos;s from : - )
if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you find the cause and solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another sink ( e.g. , sink ) .
this does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just listen to mp3 . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you are looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server with the highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . to enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either do not use the Arts driver but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver was strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the Control Center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ gs react to the visu@@ ali@@ zations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . execute logs in order to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask IR@@ C channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( end Amar@@ ok previously ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files as system administrator and once as your normal user . then delete all the ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the latest -@@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run logs again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album by Br@@ its Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let it run with the alarm : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will be wo@@ ken by the soft sounds of the music you have stopped prior to going to bed .
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; running tracks when you are on another computer ?
if there is a functioning SSH environment , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running item : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this assumes your identification is available in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa .
the visu@@ al@@ is@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok window . press d on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button represents a piece in the queue of the queue . pressing the Enter key after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
OK , the player window and the playlist have tri@@ cky features , but what about the icon in the Control Panel &apos;s system section ?
click the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browsers to display .
my Personal Fol@@ der $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click on Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . for normal reading switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g instead .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ rate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &apos; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ;
basically , this will adapt the previous evaluation to a dec@@ lining value based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the play has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the playlist window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and edit : select the score or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want to tell you when to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a specified publication plan that is not to be combined with the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon while playing anim@@ ate in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool bar . select Settings tool bar ... and take the desired changes there .

if you want to use AL@@ SA then please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and a lot of bug reports .
presum@@ ably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore , the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I have &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
probably you use a distribution that inst@@ alls the development files separately from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary developer files are missing . the same also applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel .
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : do not use L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS if you compile Amar@@ ok .
I receive the message &quot; There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad module is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed .
you will get the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .

I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
setting up settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output give you the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the default sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second one .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
intel@@ pp@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
enter the configuration dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output takes place on the USB sound@@ card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the check on sound@@ card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with arts is not taken care of . of course you can take this problem by yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so urgently needed super@@ visor for arts : )

with the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically re @-@ collect your collection once you change something on the selected folders . if you have many pieces , this could take a while .
there is a search filter directly below the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . references to the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
under the search filter there is a selection box with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can choose from different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . furthermore , you can of course also select your complete collection so that the filter will be switched off practically .
clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options .

the play@@ lists browser simplifies the handling of many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes smart play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the playlist is smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at runtime . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click Add Smart Play@@ list to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub@@ window is used for the connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , before starting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod according to artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser .
to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired tracks from the playlist and drop them to the list performer . if you are done , click Apply . so the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is complete , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the disk integration for your iPod .

for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z enter and press enter key , you can access music in the music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist becomes longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simple drop @-@ down . in this case , holding down the shift key can be helpful : this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply drag and drop the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you type letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again .
if you enter separate search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter a two three , search will find all entries containing one , two and three .
if you enter OR enter between the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found .
if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then close the search term with go@@ ose feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not after entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a particular search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain something .
you can combine these syntax variants as you like . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that include either Mike Old@@ field , or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad .
you can set the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click on the entries in the desired order . the entries then get a label with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar &apos;s toolbar can be found at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . to the left , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . to the right , you will find playlist , empty and Rand@@ om playlist .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to und@@ o or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the tool bar there is a unique , expanding analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one you see in the player window over the right mouse button . using this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos; s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example , playback controls and volume controls . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool tracks .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current play , the number of pieces and the total play@@ time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eving , a sli@@ der for the playback position and the playing time of the current play is displayed .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . from this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;

fills your playlist with random items from your entire collection and adds other random items during playback .
adds pieces based on last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : Audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile so that this dynamic playlist works .
double @-@ click on the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or right click on it and then select Load . so , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist in any circumstances !
the two pre @-@ set modes Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ list Mix instantly fill in your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist receiving pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next part change , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . the dynamic mode can also be disabled via the same menu entry .
the New button initi@@ ates the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . playlist will open the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the ability to click Edit . as a result , the dialog to edit the settings of the playlist will open .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming tracks will be ski@@ pped and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played will be removed with attention to setting the play@@ able pieces .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces to be added to the playlist after each played play . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continue to grow because only one piece can be played and removed .
the options on the right have been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you check multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add random items from any of the play@@ lists you have crossed .
some scripts enable your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on setup .

this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have a exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy formats , remember that when encoding MP3 files you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a los@@ sy format . use the au@@ CD@@ t@@ ect project to do so .
in this dialog box you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to copy a data CD in just four steps . to follow the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and have inserted the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive .
to copy a data @-@ CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you now see a dialog which looks like this :
in this dialog window you can track the progress of the copying process . once the original image is read in the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD media to which the data should be burned .

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ R@@ s in one pass ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burn all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the features that also &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality with burned audio CDs .
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional technology for audio encoding and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Decoder and En@@ co@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , it is possible , for example , to dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t WMA files and then burn them to an audio CD .
SO@@ X : a utility that can convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the SO@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : an auth@@ oring system fully equipped to edit , dis@@ assemble and analyze video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the various albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are played differently .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . clicking on an entry will open the project .
save the current project . if the project has already been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
saves the current project under a new filen@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save as shown to which you can choose folder and filen@@ ame for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; according to what should happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to happen , just as if you had called for each project file closure .
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each un@@ saved project will be asked what to do with it , as if you had called File C@@ lose .
when you access this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files appear in the base folder of the CD .
this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? help ( available through the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video @-@ DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b to import files from a previous session into the current project . this is useful if you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data from the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD , which you can then write later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file . alternatively , you can also create an image of a DVD , which you can later burn later . besides , it is also possible to convert a DVD with the help of the copying dialog , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will completely er@@ ase the content . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between writing modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental .
burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button . ( ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously utili@@ sed DVD video can be converted . this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the read video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges .
this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
shows a list of the tool bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is ti@@ cked , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is ti@@ cked , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the table view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the table of contents . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium .
the table of contents allows you to select and drag files to the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view .
the header bar is a narrow area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header has no real function , it only looks nice and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this will open a dialog box to change the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the top part , you can adjust the key allocation for that further down .
this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs . to do this , system administrator rights are required , so you have to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) at the start of the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , as many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled , for example , via a shell script .
to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P , you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical to the range of functions , so your taste and the type of your task are crucial to which of the programs you prefer .
in this chapter , we assume that you use the d@@ co@@ p command line program . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P features , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; then type something like the following on the console :
besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and more functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void debu@@ d@@ f ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) void bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can obtain a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then obtain a reference to the project using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ link curr@@ ent@@ Project By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface , which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String path )
this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ able / home / tru@@ eg / som@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ txt / fo@@ o / bar
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; audio CD ; it can easily be read and stored in MP3 or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible , depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is the interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard disk ) and by many enco@@ ders that en@@ code these WAV files . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ ga for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( These enco@@ ders may still be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format or in other formats like loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD , is used by &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done right now .
for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ pre@@ to ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything by yourself . however , only the enco@@ ders need to be installed . if , for example , FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required .
which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Which encoding / file format gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read out the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device handle the protection , it is not possible to avoid any copy protection mechanisms ; just avoid purchasing copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only once ( the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling of reading a &amp; CD is explained afterwards . this will ( hopefully ) help understand the lean approach of the user interface that you frequently stum@@ ble at the beginning .
can convert into many formats - depending on which enco@@ ders are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; get information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the internet or can work completely without network , with everything being recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program .
the CD@@ DB requests the CD data according to the setup of request on the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established . )
start reading and - if an encoder configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Guide - encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read as the default with a different encoder . it should be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog .
opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and code .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ p@@ ses ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; quit ) .
opens the Main Setup dialog from &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the En@@ co@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C there are others such as &apos; shor@@ ts &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the draw@@ backs are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files .
among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 kb@@ ps ) , but over this bit rate the differences are less important as both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is shipped with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open licenses questions
+ High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is present .
MP3 - when music is to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 kb@@ ps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . requires up to 320 kb@@ ps for complex pieces of music and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 kb@@ ps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 kb@@ ps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos; -@@ h &apos; = 128 kb@@ ps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 kb@@ ps for all pieces of a song . good enough for music of teenagers , portable devices and car equipment . but not good enough for better stereo hi @-@ fi systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ kb@@ ps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you don &apos;t want to have absolutely top quality without regard to file size , then choose this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters . you can transfer / use &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; and create the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding explain the switches for these programs .
for example , to add the title to the keyword ( English : tag ) when encoding MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; added . the result looks like : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that provide information to download / enter , so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the machine itself . it is to be noted that here only is spoken by text : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , Name of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med .
in &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is actively a check box to select ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b may be used with another ( counter@@ f@@ eit ) address other than the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving data from the server ( but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally the next underlying mirror server is to be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org gives a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually monthly generated ) only the updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save in WAV files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ors that it will be used c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ; those who want to know more exactly , seek in the source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; s. to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not yet happened .
to save the read WAV files , the encoder and the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains predefined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the encoding tab . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the code reader package must be installed from the Linux distribution concerned before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined enco@@ ders . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , you can obtain further information about its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; Con@@ sole ) .
this can have many causes . check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the read and write real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give you tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you &apos;ll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want .
in this example we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 kb@@ ps on average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 keywords ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . for example , a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found using a search engine because it is considered not to be completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; , something which is probably only done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what must be repeated for each CD ;
here we determine the enco@@ ders to be used for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 kb@@ ps ) .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change them at each reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found .
the device name is transferred to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , then a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device desig@@ nations for CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives .
here is not much to do . here an additional transformation can be defined . in our example , everything is as left / inserted as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only in case of incomplete information please select , so that you will be informed if there is a lack of information on creating keywords ( tags ) .
the card board CD ; -@@ Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down box is easier , will be a &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filen@@ ames or tag entries , you can easily change . the directory or file name will be changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger .
you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you download the database before . however , this is over 6@@ 20 MB , consider this twice if this is worthwhile . in order to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection fields have to be selected , at least the first . the mode is set on the following card board .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how do the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we did not download the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror @-@ server near you . on this path the load is distributed among the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work at the same time as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ ggle the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , because the protocol is usually open to surf the internet .
in this example we do not want to send any data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously le@@ aking pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author does not know , therefore simply try it yourself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this to check out the CD ; at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , the path / folder can be specified in which the wa@@ v files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . don &apos;t forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself .
just enter it as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something has to be fli@@ pped to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et Extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit@@ rate is average about 224 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the generation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change in the tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :

this is it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio@@ visual ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a CD ; if you have wis@@ ely chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again .
this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , has been described and set up in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is structured , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b is described .
since we use a CD which is not yet included in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look slightly different than those for a CD ; with successful data collected by fre@@ ed@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; manually enter data instead of extrac@@ ting them from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
don &apos;t try the CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; output of the author of this manual .
if this is not done yet , then the &amp; CD must be inserted in the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as in the screen@@ shot . this only if the CD ; as an audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this is not done , look for the Help section in the FAQ section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window , and you can select the database entry that best suits your &amp; CD ; fits .
if you have not selected the check box for automatic query from fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you will need to connect to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - Input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece .
the comment field of the album can be used for the individual comments , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any undesi@@ red remarks .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters for the comment field . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio@@ .DLL ; this option is set on the encoding settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that obviously coinci@@ des with the style of the tap@@ ering CD ; in this example , this is not important as we do not provide the CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button on the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are shown above the BO@@ M .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off . make sure that all pieces are selected , or press the All Parts button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
if you click on the Sel@@ ection button to read the selection process , this window appears for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on .
click on the tab orders to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the jobs . the first piece is currently read@@ out to the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you will see this error message when you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example . did you check if you have write access to the temporary files folder and destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred directly after reading the first piece .
assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and coding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found any configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding ( of however , two different pieces ) .
now the last song is read while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message will be displayed for a short time in the top left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
&amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; is now within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS is part of the multimedia package . however , if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous package from there . most distri@@ butions already include pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you are reading this , you probably have already done it ...
this section is aimed at people compiled from source files , not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you :
a program that calls up many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it displays screen@@ shots of the different card tabs of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still reading ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after starting the program , without any clu@@ e as it should continue from this empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who is reading this , probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio@@ creator ; thought . whoever wants to add or change anything useful may do it . at least only after contacting the author . and if you read this , he left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion .
strange if you managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these informations , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , it features real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound Project driver that is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying color , making it easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to save text to MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
session support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external mi@@ di syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the toolbar , select the play button from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it onto the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces , they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the knob .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo ad and adjust the playback speed . to get back the original tempo , double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure acts on the space bar like a print on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use texture , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically detected , which a song is used , so you do not have to manually adjust the pop @-@ up menu . if you select the Auto Text option in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text will be automatically selected , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type .
if you want to specify an event type , select the text events and / or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section , you will find how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu item under the item Organization .... Click on New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning .
if you have more than one collection , you can select the desired one in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember this when you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , you have to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . in turn , the file dialog will appear , with which help you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection .
when automatic add @-@ on to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or drag &amp; drop ) .
if automatic add to collection is not enabled , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when a piece is opened . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces .
to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menu items , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection .
when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select Next Song , the next song next to the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to return a song vice versa , select the Pre@@ view piece , the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to delete and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid .
this is absolutely necessary for syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not General MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events which the syn@@ thesizer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change Patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change Patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and thus always lets a trumpet sound when you originally have to play a piano .
if you have only one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map , because all sound cards are GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) .
unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file manually ( with your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece .
each section may only appear once , except the Key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , each occurrence is a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine PAT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther key@@ map ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can provide support in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support for devices that are not General MIDI @-@ compatible .
in this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order or om@@ it any row for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all sounds that need this instrument to sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot .
so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , no matter what sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that this is meant by the term drum patch of the patch where each sound represents another percussion instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc . ) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have it ) .
the Key@@ map section is used to specify how sound can be m@@ apped to a specific channel or instrument . the use is :
as with the PAT@@ CH@@ MAP range , the order of the rows is very important , as is their presence .
you can define several key maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
key maps are mainly used to map tones on the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look as an example of the provided key maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , simply make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP segment .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards , which have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI to Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP segment has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel that is m@@ apped to the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the keyword will be defined with the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x is used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the perc@@ ussions channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to avoid decim@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard that receives a pitch Ben@@ der Event is to play a pitch higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . this can be found in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings
the channel view is a window with a whole series of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you can see which sounds are being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button does not illumin@@ ate green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used .
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the Settings menu , select View Channel View : settings
the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
you can change the pace of a song . so if you find , for example , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs around 50 KB , while a mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) from &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos; s start page )
I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files separately .
accept , therefore , support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window .
first , enable setting Automatic Add to Collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the default tempo you can double click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or if I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; change the window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid .
if you only want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , switch off the Auto add setting to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . opening Files
suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ V. and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so set the Auto add to the collection and open A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file .
then decide to play also B.@@ S@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard , this will encourage me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; laga ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; laga . at the moment I &apos;m not much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take some time .
if you want to know where to download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , a bug or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid , or even if you want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard or a MI@@ DI@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will list ( if you want ) . before sending a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might have the file .
I &apos;ve written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and didn &apos;t get money from anybody for it . I would like to emphasize that I just keep programming because / when I get feedback from users ( post@@ cards or emails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also apply Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , error correction or even a supporting email .
and of course , my thanks also applies to all these excellent musicians on the net , who give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and look at images . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer , as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you have a sound card , except that you can of course not listen to music .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ on@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User mailing list .
the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ do@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the Book@@ marks menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing XML configuration files . of course you can only do this if &amp; S@@ MB ; not running . the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / apps can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . to do so simply click on a name of a category , then select the XML content of this part .
after changing XML files , the Edit menu has to be selected with Play@@ list and either select Edit mode , or select another category .
all changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing it with the playlist .
due to the ease of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player ; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c and alter@@ ing &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ yte option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; S@@ MB ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be disturbing at the end @-@ animation though , the user can therefore finish the application a second time .
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of your favorite photos : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; in@@ verse &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; file : / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet &quot; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; smil@@ e.@@ In the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; are in the list testing / some examples of S@@ MI@@ L that are supported by &amp; KM@@ Player .
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things .
another tool for debu@@ gging is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the toolbar of KM@@ Player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ er@@ c , like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a flash is playing with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; S@@ MB ; it can even include the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player module needs to be specified as a service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave @-@ flash in the setup dialog file assignments of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the back@@ end output is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( View , Con@@ sole , or Con@@ sole from the context menu ) .
in order to always have a given back@@ end for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is also determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ MB ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data recorder ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialog in Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there should be detected ports , of which one is selected . the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it .
since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ Player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is also supported only on the first screen ( : 0.0 ) . for this reason , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
internally , KM@@ Player uses different names for the sources . at the time of the creation of this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ al , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scann@@ ers , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if enabled , they start playing the playlist .
are there hints how I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the command HD@@ PAR@@ M -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is a user root after mounting the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom drives to the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why does each time my CPU have to be tested for performance ?
note : the answer is b@@ ump@@ y. k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically takes the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to compile &amp; Ki@@ le ; needed .
L@@ ate@@ x ; : a professional typ@@ es@@ etting application . among Unix @-@ like systems is likely to be res@@ or@@ ted to the package &amp; tex@@ tra@@ ide ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the Linux / Linux distribution . for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD should be used ; / DVD .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project includes some pre @-@ compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; web page .
this manual is for everyone - regardless of experience with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users hardly have to read this manual . however , all the suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or documentation is desired , the contact should be made via the box ; web page .
if you have any questions about or when comp@@ iling &amp; Ki@@ le , please contact Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net on the mailing list of Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; working surface . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex ; programs . furthermore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the easy @-@ to @-@ use wizard , the &amp; latex ; reference and powerful project management .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its options to learn the manual to K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter working with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; start .
for &amp; latex ; is the right balance : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( narrow lay ) &amp; latex ; -@@ mac@@ ros can also be used . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
while here only a good overview of &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book for it . to be able to rule properly , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 can be used .
the introduction includes at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body starts with the command \ \ begin { document } and has to be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick Installation Wizard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful tool for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; selecting the wizard provides some options for the creation of the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
documentary classes : this describes the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , letter &#91; letter &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ text@@ &#93; , projector &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : this sets the character encoding . it should use the code encoding of the system . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be selected ( for the correct processing of the &amp; latex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; latex ; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( for compliance with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use when creating German texts .
new users do not have to worry about this . it is just a short description of the functions and further information on this is given in the section .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ones ) . by &amp; Ki@@ le , a simple problem search will be possible ( example ) : if you want to see more areas of a large text on the screen , it is very prob@@ able that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you will save it by high@@ lighting time and time debu@@ gging .
with the automatic completion of the environment , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically generates an empty line ( for entering the text ) and the associated line to the lie@@ uten@@ ant of the command ( e.g. \ \ Complete } ) . this function can be set in the menu Set@@ ting ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands will be disabled .
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to the following elements ( part is the highest and neither the least the lowest element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful for searching . once a DVI ; file &#91; dependent D e V ice I n@@ ap File &#93; &#93; &#93; was created , &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source code .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output types from &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; there are many tools for viewing , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices .
when using the context search , the elements of the DVI ; file are connected with the editor and as soon as one element is cli@@ cked in the DVI ; file , the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source code is j@@ umped to the corresponding section in the &amp; latex ; source code is applied to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set about project project settings .
fast construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no source code errors ) .
file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; file will be carried out in this mode , and it will not be called &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , after the rapid construction .
when looking at the Edit toolbar , the three large selection fields should be noticed . the selection boxes were designed for fast insertion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for quick classification of the document into parts , chapters , sections ...
the selection box Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting articles such as keywords , notes or references . the available possibilities are :
name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or another element is created .
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection field ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box named Gr@@ Ã ¶ v@@ est is used for defining the font size . you can set the fonts for the main text , notes , etc . there are the following fonts :
when calling &amp; ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and closing the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done later in the text .
once the above code example has been entered , the &amp; latex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the building or the quick @-@ construction button .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using rapid construction &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns shall have a different font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will allow the modification of the font sizes inside the environment .
the changes are considered only within the environment ( from \ \ begin ) to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no reduction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to ease the read@@ ability and usability of the document . for example , you can add certain fonts , bold print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands can end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the ital@@ ics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a sentence can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quote : creates a quote in the document . the quote begins with \ \ begin { quote } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
after the background to writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; mark@@ up language was presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; .
as soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard , there should be some adjustments for the better read@@ ability of the document . therefore , at least one quote , a few spots in fat and ital@@ ics pressure and a poem may come to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , the editor view or C@@ trl E can be converted back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) .
once the DVI ; file is created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conver@@ ters or computer screens .
for the printing of a &amp; DVI ; file are the same steps as for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed out using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file is made of the &amp; latex ; source code , the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar .
the preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI ; file .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a corresponding setting for all &amp; latex ; bin@@ aries . for this purpose only Modern may be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Tools building must be selected .
to execute the preview search , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on forward search . the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI ; viewer takes place then .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; latex ; -@@ Document of &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . for this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ey@@ epi@@ ece ; Set as text editor ( Set@@ ting up the ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
if you do not want to open the &amp; DVI , you may have an error . if an error is present , it will be shown in the logging file or in the message window .
the logging file declares the source of errors in the source text . in the editor you can then use the La@@ Te@@ X errors and ne@@ sts La@@ Te@@ X errors for jumps between the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the incorrect line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document . the default options are :
when selecting an empty document , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document .
frequent users of &amp; latex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or a new file must be created . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... create .
when creating a new document from a template by File New , some strings may be replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set in Settings Ki@@ le ... Settings can be set .
when creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is sub@@ stituted by entering document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { items } .
the easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way , the following steps must be executed :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files will be created . an easy way to create a template should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below should be searched .
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for &amp; k@@ ate ; can be made in the menu tools directly out &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn the manual to K@@ ate should be consul@@ ted . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very convenient &amp; latex ; command reference which can be called via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains almost all commands that can be found in &amp; latex ; use and its syntax .
double @-@ clicking with the C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; word means that the \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ par .
when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to search the most different types of source texts and highlight these . for example , the &amp; latex ; -@@ commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many wizard can add additional ho@@ cks . this is an own type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu entries Edit Fi@@ cks or the corresponding keyboard short@@ cuts allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . this also emphasizes the jump mark , so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers excellent possibilities , have been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source text added ; special commands for their selection .
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also closes &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands with a back panel ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) will be selected at the end .
for the deletion of a part of the document it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; provides the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility .
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is included in the description to edit output paragraph .
it has already been made clear that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for additional commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command j@@ umped to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command at the end of the environment .
this command j@@ umped to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current location is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to hide the environment .
if the cursor is in front of or within the \ \ begin { vicinity } command , skip to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview below can be quickly lost . this command buck@@ les the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not broken .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups which are determined by cl@@ amps { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that match those from editing environment .
with this command j@@ umped to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket .
this command j@@ umped to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the pin buck@@ le .
if the cursor happens before or behind the cur@@ ly clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , the other end of the group is spra@@ yed ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups par@@ enth@@ eses may be lost easily . this command buck@@ les the last group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple application signs are used as man@@ ors . for the practical implementation it is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; is used for two simple application signs . &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and supports two closing arguments for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic entry of the double trigger character can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used in all languages ( e.g. , german or french ) and thus German or French reference marks . many other languages can also be available .
when using Shift . enter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is within a Listen environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item .
within a table environment , close &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a closing line breaks down .
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set@@ ting up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and thus all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; attempts to enable this . while pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; looks &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the underlying line . although this tab is not the associated tab , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some spaces for the columns position of the current tab@@ ul@@ ator .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already provides a good source code completion , it has been expanded in &amp; Ki@@ le ; to include special commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) . three of these work according to need and the other two are configured for automatic completion . all these modes can be set for different working modes under Settings Ki@@ le ... Compl@@ et@@ ely set .
at the beginning a new environment with the command \ \ begin { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } becomes &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ end { vicinity } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and possible , the complete list of characters will be deleted . on the other hand , the list may also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are also removed by selecting a command . alternatively , you can also add ho@@ cks to these positions , so that an easy jump to these positions is possible using Edit H@@ ock marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set@@ ting up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . different menu lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands and qui@@ vers of general language use can be selected .
the command mode is not useful for the execution of environments . there must always be a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the call of the Complete mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing the environment .
when invo@@ king the Compl@@ et@@ ely Environment Options above or the key short@@ cut Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically captured to open the environment and it will begin \ \ begin . after that the environment can be resum@@ ed in the simplest way and by pressing the input button .
after this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added .
under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the des@@ ks list of the Complete mode for &amp; tex ; - &amp; &amp; latex ; -@@ Comm@@ ands .
&amp; Ki@@ le ; support custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le can be set up . for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X entry is included .
for example , the letter L is entered and the word Compl@@ et@@ ely initiated over the menu editor or the key C@@ trl + Alt spac@@ eb@@ ar will be replaced by the character L by the character string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large qu@@ aters are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many documents are written more than once in a document . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all already written requests .
this mode can be set up in the Options menu ... Ki@@ le can be completely shut off . here also the tres@@ hold for the display of the complete compensation can be specified .
the full files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ lichen home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ( Ab@@ brevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphics dialog box shapes the setup of graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics to the graphics formats , the sections should be followed and followed .
PS files are not as known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file .
in order to be able to examine the results of the work , you need to compile the source code . all the construction tools are group@@ ed together in groups , compilation , converting and creating view .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard short@@ cut Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file in the default viewer can be viewed using Alt ; 3 , by means of Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by means of Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open every time .
a new project will be asked about the Project New Project . here you will find the following information for the project :
when filling the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows to execute EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be managed in scripts in the vertical bar .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be changed in other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help for supporting users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages contained and a further &amp; latex ; -@@ reference .
this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a complete instruction manual for the &amp; latex ; commands contain and is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . because this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; Ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks .
due to the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ tur@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all too &amp; ki@@ le ; delivered documents and for a graphical surface .
all documents are divided into categories and the biggest advantage is the search for pack@@ et names or keywords . from &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar opens the viewer to the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; ki@@ le ; is also part of the Fink project , which allows &amp; ki@@ le ; also available on &amp; Mac ; with OS @-@ X installed .

&amp; c@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures edit you in the graphical user interface of &amp; c@@ sig ; . with the command @-@ line interface you generate random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides signatures for external email programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures an arbitrary signature from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig is read ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information you can make your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for daily signatures the same signature will be read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day you use different signatures as with the random signatures you create unique e @-@ mails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . by this , you will receive an lt ; empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click the &amp; lt ; empty signature ; and add your new signature in the lower section .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use emails privately or professionally , there are always plenty of signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross Remove in the toolbar .
to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button on the bottom right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; k@@ de ; 3.5 required . to attach signatures to your emails , you need a program such as &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

version 3.2 by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows my pro@@ c and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take it a little bit , let &apos;s give it a graphical interface ! don &apos;t rely on a terminal ; just click on the symbol for the XML processor and finish !
this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ do@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ do@@ deci@@ book is in the shared folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder you want in the other folder .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time my pro@@ c is started .
as I said before , everyone who has been working on the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the currently opened file is inde@@ x.@@ do@@ doc@@ book , then simply leave the current working folder selected . if not , then select the current folder and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
if it comes to output on the screen , your file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; then just drop the current file . if not , delete the file in the current file and select the file to be checked by means of another file - file selection .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed review option .
for using a &amp; D@@ TD ; that is specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( Internal ) ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and enter the place of &amp; D@@ TD ; using definition UR@@ I ; specify the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection is required .

enter the name of the file as the result should have named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; invite , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even possibly little to do . this will immediately benefit the plug @-@ in system . you can benefit from the additional functionality instantly and do not have to wait until somebody builds the desired in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start using the Edit plug @-@ in menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows to manage all of the plug@@ ins contained and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose himself from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears gre@@ asy after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of your own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of your team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : an event can be created for information to team leaders when something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project . an example would be the opening and closing of the project so that later on how much someone is working on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that inserts a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
the event configuration page of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project Project Properties dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an email is sent to the add@@ res@@ sees selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how such ladder can be set up .
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
to enter notes is simple . it can either select the comment entry from the editor context menu or enter the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment field followed by ann@@ ot@@ ation text .
in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project from the following options :
nick@@ names and roles names are independent of lower@@ case or lower@@ case , but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a development environment for script and format@@ ting languages that is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up via Qu@@ anta Settings ... This dialog extends over some pages that are treated one after the other .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with it . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal bulk / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted as described in the tag@@ XML files .
optional tags automatically include : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , it will be inserted immediately after &amp; gt ;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of simple tags .
start and End Date automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the appropriate encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ s for det@@ ecting various types of files . using the Standard Res@@ et button , the def@@ aults can be restored .
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise file opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD is not recognized . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; regularly compil@@ es backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash at the next start of the program , the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file .
preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor pane or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to preview the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the default Windows settings back to the default at the next start is useful when changing the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending / app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameter .
the warning al@@ erts area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more .
the location to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be used to display symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL and the source text view in divided mode . see the different modes .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree representing the illustration of the par@@ ser nodes in the document can be adjusted in detail .
in the area of the mouse click on the structure tree the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the Struc@@ tural tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically . empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document .
the section for setting Ab@@ brevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) that will un@@ fold when editing to more extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ect abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
plug @-@ ins are part @-@ applications from third party , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder .
load component in &quot; Read @-@ only &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in refuses to load the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected .
check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , test@@ et &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; whether the entered information is correct . select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from version 3.3 , debu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . ( 3 ) Deb@@ ug@@ ger has been set , as well as support for the DB@@ G debu@@ gger . instead , a Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implem@@ entations via plug @-@ ins .
currently only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; insert .
using the debu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger Plugin Sel@@ ection box , the specific settings can be changed .
when a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; user interface :
a view where the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
a view where all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower dock .
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is displayed . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
depending on the debu@@ gger functionality , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
this action is used to connect to the debu@@ gger if required , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger &apos;s demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger , so that normally it does not have to be taken care of .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session Start the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or ends the listening according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a de@@ bug requirement . this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document . the output of this request will be displayed in the debu@@ gger output view .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens , while the script is hal@@ ted , execution continues . happens before a debu@@ gging process has started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens , while a script is hal@@ ted , the execution continues .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include , if possible .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if the current one is not .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set .

this chapter describes how to adjust &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; adapt to your needs and how you can &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; help to get better .
document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to give support for mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , tag folder and toolbar icons ( above the editing pane ) , insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see for details on conversion .
this document describes how to create tag XML files , then the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool bars . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ day ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool bars enable fast insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error .
tag folder are nothing but folder . they contain only the descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carries the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users get a better insight and more information when working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than just element type over itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . specifies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag . ( only family 1 )
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
this element can only happen once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . in addition , there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be shown &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element .
returns the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name inside &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag .
a container tag that summari@@ zes the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is a single element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
returns a list of elements that end a tag . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be properly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; . this will not cause any leg break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear , with simple instructions to follow .
this feature is currently not available . currently , the verification is only done when loading the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filen@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the filen@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as easy and there is an editor for editing D@@ TD &apos;s D@@ TD settings . this can be edi@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD statement . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / en ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ TD . if not specified , the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be created with settings actions ... click New action to create the same dialog :
the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the user defined button , a keyboard short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ einer , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) , which change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way , the script tries to find : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ PAT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we are replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; if of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; only one instance is running , the text unique is added to the PID # . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the external script is used .
the parameters for this event , usually the filen@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in the input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is normally only useful with this setting .
the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed according to the input . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output ; error messages , directed to the default error output . it can be specified , what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the input field output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in given case , it is not too many , therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the market .
once a toolbar has been added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
complete all and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; Edit Tag , &quot; if available so that an input is possible while using the action .
Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let us replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose Edit size .
please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does , but also all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered loose , star@@ ed , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will insert a &amp; lt ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder in which the saved icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the Apply button and continue with other tags , so there are still some , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by several separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool bar to set Settings dialog from Settings toolbar . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I would like to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my tool bar . after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the toolbar .
for example , I want a quick way to have access to the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ator support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the Start button .
the new toolbar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
save to the right folder . after Re@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in root folders , but your toolbar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c , so that its toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( will ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for the normal user , the ability to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or format@@ ting language you like most . that &apos;s why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Rep@@ osit@@ ory if someone has done it for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to search an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc / language . then you have to create the doc@@ r@@ c file .
# K@@ DE Configuration File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = path , relative to this file , for example PHP / PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Tag 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 2.@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = Table of Contents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Contents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own contents . there is no known limit for the depth of the pack@@ et ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it by yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consistently at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder will be shown ! ) .
spaces do not affect anything , but watch &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; Resource files are replaced .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file that is used to create context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script should display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines .
a simple list of con@@ cre@@ ted context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you have specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your html doc@@ s there .
if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Rep@@ osit@@ ory for use by the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; community . you will not get rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . at different places there is an Email menu item , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with email , send the toolbar &apos;s toolbar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive from where all the others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; users can download them . we recommend that the contributions are verified and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful to publish them . in order to make a present contribution , we recommend that resources be signed , both for our team and for the future users .
when up@@ loading you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private g@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New Resource , the input fields need to be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be up@@ loading from D@@ TD D@@ TD &apos;s D@@ TD ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menu , up@@ loading the toolbar &apos;s toolbar , and started from the files and folders context menu in the templates and scripts tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please read the warning noti@@ fications carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed , a message will appear stating the source of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; but creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag XML format . there &apos;s the easier way to convert a D@@ TD into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD File menu and converting a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when enabled &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; after converting the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; there are some key concepts . to understand this and to be able to draw full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you must first famili@@ ari@@ ze yourself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to famili@@ ari@@ ze them with these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; little use would bring them .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it stores all that is marked globally , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this allows the administrators to backup different tool tracks , actions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ powers the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the index tabs with information and tool@@ bars . please check in , and for further information on these fields .
you can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing the current , other or all index tabs , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS instructions to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor pane will lead to another context menu regarding the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( Cut / Copy / In@@ sert ) , edit the tag under the mouse cursor , help the word under the mouse cursor or open the file if the string is designated a file under the mouse poin@@ ter .
at the top end of the editor window are the editor &apos;s toolbar icons . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as default for which a set of tool bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and and related user needs .
the use of tool bars is really easy . if they want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the symbol representing the tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the representation with tabs are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting files from the storage media can be done with the then displayed context menu .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; working area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of breakdown in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script . by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree opens .
this tree appears under the other tree views . with it , man@@ a@@ geable attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces can change . the application system aligned to the content allows to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; &apos; documentation site , you can create own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can add , edit and view project @-@ specific documentation .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to the D@@ TD will be displayed .
this index poin@@ ter shows all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; scripts that are executed give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command . the chocolate side of the tool bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ;
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; like any other !
it is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have trouble starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 is located in the PAT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while trying to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us started to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; a stand@@ alone , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor ? well , this would make him the absolute most powerful web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summari@@ zed : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; for that the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developing what already someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding is not only possible for users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; so to expand as they need it for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is possible almost every task . through the program Com@@ mander they can expand and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; without having to mem@@ ori@@ ze any scrip@@ ting language syntax . ( more about it in . )
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for fast web development and has quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , with the oldest entry being taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board , so they are correctly displayed and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instructions .
converts the text from the clip@@ board into &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script outputs error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window where you see the display of the script sections and the debu@@ gger .
removing and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated once you switch to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar to the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document .
book@@ marks from other open documents appear in the menu group@@ ed by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects are saved with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . that allows you to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project Dir / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your toolbar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : local or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this will only create the name . actions need to be added to the toolbar by settings ... or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete them from the hard drive . if you have not yet saved the toolbar , you will be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; team so that the toolbar will be available in the next publication ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment .
enables the up@@ loading of tool tracks to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; , which you or someone else has made and convert to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; own description format .
loading / retri@@ eving entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load will fail .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag preferences when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ Speci@@ fic sub@@ menus .
currently this works only with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this tag is contrary to the rules .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug@@ ins are listed below the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in will de@@ activate it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; by means of the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between the different types of the user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch may sometimes need time or cause un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the index card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . selecting an entry will enable the corresponding sub@@ window .
enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; main window .
the changes in this dialog are affecting each application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set up the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate , you will find details .
a dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the toolbar , or add them and change the sequences .
this should create a help in line with the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not yet implemented .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; development in financial form , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name , the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all those paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled in automatically .
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. foo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field blank , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the remote host setting , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates for the project are saved . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars as standard . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . for server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
check if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make a precise selection for good man@@ ure .
this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , clip from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded from the menu under Project Properties in the menu tree in the Windows sub@@ window or Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders is possible ) , which are ignored for project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can read more about project views .
this allows the debu@@ gger to be selected . currently only Gu@@ bed is supported . more information about Gu@@ bed can be found in . the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin can be set using the Options button .
in the Pro@@ files sub@@ window , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by h@@ itting one &apos;s own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can activate event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a pre @-@ determined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; the last project that was open . this behavior cannot be influenced at present .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon Project open from the toolbar . the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; changes changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project tree view gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , however the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu on the right mouse button :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files .
allows removal of the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is displayed to prevent the removal .
the password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programs . this option is useful when frequently up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password on the disk cache option is not available .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us , many high @-@ loading profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server on which the files should be copied . either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should select from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password will be saved on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with knowledge of programming can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is only one set of files and tool tracks . there can be many views in a project , i.e. , by simply swa@@ p the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars .
views can be saved , opened or deleted from the Project or Project Tool@@ bar , accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; to its own working method .
as mentioned above , tool bars are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; it is best custom@@ is@@ able using the toolbar &apos;s toolbar . use and add @-@ on differ . adding tool bars is treated at the bottom of the Adding tool bar section .
the toolbar and the icons on it can be set either by context menu ( right click on the toolbar ) , in which a new toolbar can be created , any other actions such as toolbar buttons or toolbar buttons can be executed , leading to the dialog where it can be specified , which actions on this or other toolbar should be visible .

templates are essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code schn@@ itzel and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; used templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory available to the system into the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; in about the limitations you submit for the file system .
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each submission before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents by means of short@@ cuts ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree using global templates .
documents can be of any text document type . on the basis of these templates new documents can be created . normally , more specific documents are ne@@ sted in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can contain everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl . some examples are available in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure compiled in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select File As template Save as a local template ....
as soon as this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates .
select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged and dropped onto the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . all file management functions can be used for this purpose , for example to drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or .
in the file tree or project files you can click on a folder on the right and select a site template , enter a name for the template and back up . by default , it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very targeted approach . you can set he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically combine them with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files contained in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is hidden as soon as par@@ ental attributes are inherited .
this is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set , it would fundamentally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows a pre@@ arranged or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be common he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy content templates into a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( display the right mouse button ) through a complete command file for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ l@@ us ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be accessed from the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; Editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; a small green symbol shows the dependen@@ cy of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP , the source editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first , except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and V@@ PL ; editor is active , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke pus@@ hes the active cursor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document .
the synchronization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source editor can be set via Settings Qu@@ anta . after choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in the selection , the recommendation can be set automatically . in principle , the recommendation is : a small span for fast machine and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the website , the tools document properties are to be selected . this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor . this can be used to reduce the following :
met@@ a tags allow storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . Met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . a click on the list allows to change the content , such as keywords in the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . changing the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file .
use of the cursor is possible , as in a word processing , by moving the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves strange . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or a button .
inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags does not remove , e.g. when an anchor day , surrounded with text , must be removed any other tag anchor day .
some tool@@ bars such as the T@@ ables Assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled . they will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists must be used .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; to successfully compile , you will need other libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatibility mode , or@@ phan@@ ed holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a file name without path indication . file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l loaded , the following entry is possible :
in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pres@@ age named my@@ QNA@@ ME or a specified mode name will be checked . &amp; eg ; template matches with any of the my@@ ME that contains the string template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; my@@ ME &quot; is extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extended to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
this is done automatically when loading the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . stopping points are re @-@ checked shortly after the start of each iter@@ ation .

&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a debu@@ gging program ( debu@@ gging ) in X@@ SL style sheets ( X@@ SL = e@@ X@@ ten@@ fold St@@ yl@@ es@@ he@@ et Language ) . &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; has similar commands like the Unix / Linux debu@@ gger g@@ db . there are three ways to execute a style template :

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
the merge was very complicated because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was a lot of conflicts when mer@@ ging .
the program I used showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines . and there was no clu@@ e to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . the merge of these changes was a little night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a row and changes to white notes . later , a lot of other useful functions were added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison windows .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
also 3 @-@ way mer@@ ging is fully supported . this is useful when two persons independently of each other work on a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when mer@@ ging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge entire folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you frequently need to check code , you will like this function .
differences in white notes and tabs are displayed . if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters , you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders then you can ease the typing by writing only the file name of the first file . example :
k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder
opening dialog allows manual typing of file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog notes your selection and displays them again next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed .
with the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be introduced . if A file is selected for A , but a folder is used for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders .
if mer@@ ging is ti@@ cked , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not absolutely necessary to set an output file immediately . you can do this step later when saving .
the setup button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge operation .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board to the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in the opening dialog , you do not have to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also use Drag and Drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would first need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then you can simply copy , insert and then compare the relevant sections .
note : currently you can &apos;t remove anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse rest for a while on the line . then a small help window will show the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned to the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , you can see the color in which the file differs . if both files differ , the default color for it is red . ( color for conflict in settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) .
if differences are found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages , where white marks are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + for example , white marks are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few , rare cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows . if the line breaks are activated , the line is displayed on broken lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info @-@ line with the inscription output : , the file name and &#91; changes &#93; if you edited the result . usually , it already contains text by automatic mer@@ ging , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts have been resolved , saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons Jump to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two comparative windows are used , each distinction must simultaneously be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed .
sometimes , no more line is left in the group due to automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing ; there is only one plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps still choose another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a selection that you may copy and insert elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflicts ; appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . carefully follow this function .
note : if the sources ignore the numbers or ignore Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters .
this navi@@ gates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in any of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side down , side down , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also be used by other programs .
in the Au@@ xili@@ ary window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the In@@ sert key , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the sum@@ m@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ picture up@@ stream / C@@ trl @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflic@@ ting conflict . note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; all non @-@ automatically resolved conflicts are still regarded as conflict . therefore , conflicts between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts must be distinguished .
to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option Sel@@ ection automatically copy . if this option is checked , whatever you mark , will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board and no manual copying is required .
line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use carriage return + new@@ line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ diffusion 3 does not keep the len@@ ders of the source files , so you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not with bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start . ( setup menu Settings &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 ... )
select a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
if you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the chosen font does not support this display then nothing happens .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be ro@@ uted . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences knob automatically introduces an un@@ just color .
if this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator symbol is inserted .
if you press enter or return , the ind@@ entation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line .
if this option is checked , any selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board , no manual copying to the clip@@ board will be om@@ itted .
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used .
when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , to find all the identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white marks can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line .
some editors ( on some systems ) store a carriage return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a line feed &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save one new@@ line character &apos; \ &apos; . usually , ignore &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , but then files with different sizes might be displayed in the side @-@ by @-@ side comparison , although they may be disabled . during mer@@ ging , this option must be disabled .
in default this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored .
in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white notes .
search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective for complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files .
in automatic mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict has passed .
this is useful when white notes are less important in many files . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled .
these options are discussed in the chapter for scanning of folders and exec@@ uting a merge . see documentation for directory comparison and mer@@ ging for details .
if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
change this option does not affect the current program . you must &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set there globally across the control center . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries .
above the encoding fields for coding a short notice appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding is individually adjustable for each file , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can define the encoding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands .
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting of changes in white notes in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments enabled . )
this option is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column . but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply hide the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window men@@ ue . )
sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as pres@@ et name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file is maintained . )
when reading a file , it is first passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements .
when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this pre @-@ processing command . the output of the command is only used for line reconciliation . you can write your own pre @-@ processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is sufficient .
use this pre @-@ processor command for line synchronization to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This . * is an accomplished expression of the text found on each string . the \ \ 1 in the creation string references the found text in upper@@ case letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword generated text $ . now , a pre @-@ processing command for line reconciliation is required , which removes the automatically generated text : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you &apos;re experim@@ enting with sed , you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions . they &apos;re very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ diffusion 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for line reconciliation . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and any hits will be replaced by nothing , thus quasi deleted .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from each other . example :
instead sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever , per@@ l only needs some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data according to the normal pre@@ processor will be retained for display and mer@@ ging . subsequent operations only change the data that the new@@ line Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus can see .
note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the line @-@ like pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre @-@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge entire folders recur@@ sively with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 .
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate co@@ hesi@@ on and show the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog .
if three folders are merged , Fol@@ der 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder .
note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( further details follow . )
when you read the folder , you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress . if you stop scanning the folder , only the files that have been compared to that will be listed .
when scanning the folder is finished , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 shows ; a list window with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is represented here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions All sub@@ directories can be opened and All sub@@ directories can be opened with which you can open or fold all the folders .
if you double @-@ click on a file , the comparison of the file will be started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns .
with identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of entries is different .
folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . at folders , age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is green , then yellow and later when it is old , red becomes red .
... A and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical , but not C : copying C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical , but not A : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a file and B a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , mer@@ ging cannot be started .
the syn@@ cing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and when the option synchron@@ izes directories is active . then sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for one entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
if two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the same date appears , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange those errors are not fixed , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during mer@@ ging , one file is executed after the other . the status column shows fer@@ v@@ ently if the merge was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right everywhere .
if in the setup dialog the File Com@@ par@@ ison Method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Def@@ 3 will display additional columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts only appears if three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
note : if you have not specified a destination folder , then in the Three Fol@@ der Mer@@ ge mode C is used as a target , B is selected as the target and B is used for synchron@@ izing A and / or B .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder , even in the folder structure . there are a number of options that might skip certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select Start / continue directory merge / continue to the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current item : select Action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid mer@@ ging actions , a message appears that points to the defective elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box appears with the Browse , Sim@@ ulate and Cancel options .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then perform certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) .
if you are finished with a file , select / continue / resume directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , an appropriate dialog will appear . then drag &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; for an error , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue to merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you have the option to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge .
if some entries have been merged individually , these entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered complete . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged once more .
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up Settings - &gt; K@@ diffusion 3 ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many self @-@ generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set specific to a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( look at info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hide attribute . in other file systems , a previous point marker marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default .
if the option is turned on , symbolic links are compared . if the option is turned on , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default .
if the option is turned on , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is turned on , the links will be treated like normal folders and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not checked for possible recur@@ sions . a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to a continuous loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; crashes . ) This option is turned off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the Statistics columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower if it is applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti pattern . )
if you compare large folders over a slow network , it might be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is de@@ activated in default .
similar to the date of change . no real comparison takes place . the files are considered identical if they are equal . this can be useful , for example , when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is de@@ activated in default .
enables syn@@ cing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the mer@@ ging suggestions are selected in such a way that both folders are identical . the results of mer@@ ging files are also stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this is considered in@@ secure because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is turned off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , the original version will be renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of single files , not just mer@@ ging entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally the folder merge view during the merge of individual files remains visible ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want that , you can switch the option directory &amp; text window to switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory &amp; text window .
probably you prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry . you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge . to do this , use the current file merge from the merge menu .
this status will be lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ loading
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax for local files and folders . you should consider a few things :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters need to be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change dates . therefore , the permissions or the modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ ality of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose is currently being the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP starts first and foremost the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ Def@@ 3 , press the right button of the mouse over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu .
normally it takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as part , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; assuming that the input file is a file in unified format . then remove &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file .
in the Con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Def@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable when the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports comparing two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode .
there are already tools called K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diffusion 2 ( now called &quot; pare &quot; ) . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge together like the diff@@ 3 program from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by watching the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programmers who have walked this path or go this way .
you compiled the source from the sources and probably not told the configure script the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white marks is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white mark is different , the line will be treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines for next to each other , this is is categ@@ ori@@ zation but this is more often the case .
the editor will notice for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information .
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger amounts of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text , suddenly , no sr@@ c is left ; no sr@@ c left , and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and mis@@ ses the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Def@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the File Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de , use the following command in the base folder of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir specifies the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
because &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties pers@@ ist , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of them .
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift ) to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection .
show only differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder .
( in the current version of the program you will need to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
this also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default .
note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be app@@ ended to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if the rows already exist ) . if the rows are already present , they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly .
in default , this option is disabled . differences in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , exit them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces .
the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries to set up ... and end . if , however , click on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries appear to minimize , maximize , View desktop and exit . the commands execute the following :
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; nbsp ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces .
when this field is ti@@ cked , in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the names of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops are displayed .
tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is ti@@ cked together with name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop .
if this field is ti@@ cked , the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the &amp; nbsp ;
if this field is ti@@ cked , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; nbsp ; otherwise , only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply display simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its standard icon and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as well known from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal and vertical row , which is very good for displaying later@@ ally on the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move windows as symbols or with their contents . in addition , it runs outside the control bar .
click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then select Set@@ ting up sel@@ ector ... lets the dialog box appear .
currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog . however , you can do this manually :
open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vice . if you do not have write permission for the file , you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator .

this application is interesting for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; quot ; .
&amp; k@@ likes ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
if you &amp; k@@ likes ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; k@@ likes ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window is called the magni@@ fication window .
in default , you can enlarge &amp; k@@ like ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter as a mobile lou@@ pe . alternatively , you may or may cause a selected screen area in the magni@@ fication window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left edge of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid the mouse cursor shown in the enlarged window , select to hide the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that this is not yet able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection box to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way :
move the mouse cursor to the magni@@ fying window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fier window . this also goes with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key or use the &amp; M@@ MB , you can move the selection box .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection box . note that the top left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved .
you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later in other applications ) , rotate the picture and much more .
start or stop the update of the ad . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go to 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is required .
in this mode , a selection box is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; k@@ likes ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , virgin ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and size &amp; etc .
also known as &amp; magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lou@@ pe . you can use &amp; magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visual handicapped .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor stays on the same spot for a while . it is intended to help people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syndrome ) and each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cursor stays on the same spot for a while . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and each mouse click causes pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , the mere moving of the mouse will cause pain . if you suffer from pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened .
to clarify this once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may differ for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement .
if the intelligent moving is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . this way you can drag the dra@@ gging with pressed mouse button . the smart shifting requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click exec@@ utes .
if it is switched on , the shooting time is active ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button wa@@ its before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse takes place .
this feature creates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but they can be changed later .
if the sound appears delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the Ri@@ der General . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
if this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is started ; at any start of &amp; k@@ de ; this feature is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; please consult the documentation at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically .
res@@ ets all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . once you have pressed the Apply button , the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user .
it is best to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first , with pres@@ ets . in particular , you should be switched off first . if you have become accustomed to automatic mouse click , you can later remove the smart move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click , it may be necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; in the case of sounds .
first you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not cause unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again .
when your mouse clicks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you need to take out the mouse ball . how this happens is different from mouse to mouse . but it should be clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can be easily scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you have just started shifting , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you run a mouse click yourself . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; still execute mouse clicks and set the cursor elsewhere .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it . but park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . secure zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows .
I try to work with the smart shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely to select text , copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it again , or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . but it will probably only cause problems once . here are some advice :
do not use the smart delay if you just start using &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead mark the text by a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse click . the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click plays . so you know exactly when the moving time starts when smart moving . later you can use the smart move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but this requires some practice .
to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X window must be installed . this should be the case on most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button once the mouse is short . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and pain prepares pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait for a certain time that a Drag process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping can be done with the mouse .

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computer speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be spoken again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page , select the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose text passages used without having to type them . text passages can of course be edited .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary , so that only properly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken words ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
when you have checked the mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken proposition is app@@ ended to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
with the menu entry Pre@@ ts@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the page word completion as well as the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service page .
in the input field of the voice output voice output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the selection field under the input field you specify the character encoding that the text is passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text is to be passed to the language generator as standard input .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possible kt@@ ts@@ d as language service , and k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD voice service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the t@@ ts@@ d language service is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ da@@ emon , the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection box action after the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage legend or in the bar for text passages .
the selected text passage will be added directly to the input field with the selection of instant messages . with the selection of In the input field , the selected passage will initially only be entered into the input field .
the second drop @-@ down box closes the edit window for text passages . you can determine if the text pass@@ book is to be automatically saved when you close the editing window .
when you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pass@@ book will not be saved . select Before Save , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book should be saved .
the word word interface contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this selection box , you can choose the currently used dictionary for word completion .
with the buttons to the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection box .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then reads &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org @-@ dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option you create a new , empty dictionary without entries . since &amp; k@@ mouth ; automatically inserts the words you entered into the dictionary , you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two parts . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part , you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pass@@ book , you can only change its name .
to add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected passages and books you can either reach through the selection in the menu bar , in the toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
the sequence of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text will be copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected ranges of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ iry date .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the toolbar has been ordered directly from the editing window under the menu bar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a narrow strip is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu entry is selected , a sliding bar for text passages is displayed with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging , the toolbar can be moved to another location .
probably you have not entered the command for the voice output properly or not fully . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the voice output voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . )

MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es to a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example , H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax gladly swal@@ lows the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / MB@@ RO@@ LA / bin / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send the data as standard input has to be turned on .
the voice output da@@ emon of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the voice generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use possible kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to successfully use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application with the people who cannot speak , print text through the computer . a list of already spoken sentences is saved , which the user can always re @-@ write .
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no voice syn@@ thesizer contains . a voice syn@@ thesizer has to be installed on the computer .
more detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; - the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service that allows any application to read text on the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; is a sub@@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; programmers who can be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
reading texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other tex@@ tual applications .
speech output is performed using the speech @-@ schedul@@ er program , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , etc .
allows you to create voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; help program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up @-@ Met@@ a @-@ Language ( SM@@ ML ) .

in addition to the bu@@ g@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions on &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can subscribe to the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / Mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de@@ .org . the developers can also find you at IR@@ C ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , Kanal # k@@ de @-@ München ) .
before you can use speech @-@ schedul@@ er , you need to install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set it properly .
at the first start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card menu will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card menu will be shown . see .
most T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female voices , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should at least set up a speaker before using &amp; kt@@ ops ; otherwise the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the default speaker .
various speakers for the same syn@@ thesizer are comparable to several printer sp@@ lines for the same printer .
when you click on the index tabs Spo@@ k@@ es@@ man in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card tabs will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and not yet set up a speaker .
all speakers already set up will appear in this list . the preferred speakers will appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not give a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to remove the speaker from the list .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to change the settings . see below .
select a speaker from the list with a mouse click and click this button to push the speaker down one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list determines also their priority .
click on any of these buttons to apply your changes to the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
select a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from .
when you click here , the new speaker appears on the card bar . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can &amp; kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the General tab and check if Voice Output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , so the T@@ TS service starts from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the cards to create and manage text orders . see .
if you have at least one speaker , you can start &amp; k@@ de the language delivery system . click on the General tab in General to open this card . here you can set some general options .
this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card box displays jobs , and you can create text orders and let them read . see . remove the mark , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de is de@@ activated .
when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is finished , run &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears once the pre @-@ reading is finished .
with the buttons in this row , you can start , stop , stop and resume text orders .
with the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board , or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click Apply or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages .
the cards are displayed only when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and tick the voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; first , you can read the text of the displayed web page . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text that is to be read , and select Tools text from the Main Menu . after a short time , the voice output should begin .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can preview the text . first , check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then check the text to be read , and select Tools text from the Main Menu . then the voice output should begin .
this also works when &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
noti@@ fy is the &amp; k@@ de news system , which noti@@ fies you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts .
in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up various types of messages ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an IR@@ C channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ops ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text .
supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry appears in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application .
the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be accepted as provided in most cases .
filters are one of the advanced skills of &amp; t@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher program . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation , to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthesis and their voices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to understand how filters work , it &apos;s important to know how the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; program works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differenti@@ ates four types of text . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the received orders will be resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the issue of the warning .
messages have the next highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web page , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone who is just entering the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . any order you initiate from the card board is a text order . K@@ S@@ ay@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not own particular ur@@ gency .
all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ read , this issue is stopped and terminated .
first you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . they are applied to normal al@@ erts , messages and text orders as well as to &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters work on the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there are still further types of filters available .
string Re@@ aders replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ops ; it is delivered with predefined strings filters that allow the creation of chat em@@ emo@@ ti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for re@@ format@@ ting messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; conver@@ sions use an X@@ S@@ LT file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
with speech selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker , you can read the text of K@@ DE messages on it .
each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied to voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below . processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of the standard filters . if a filter is not ti@@ cked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are executed from top to bottom .
click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the follow @-@ up di@@ alogs will be displayed below .
for setting string translation filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be replaced with the respective replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name as you like , it only has to differ from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from column Er@@ set . the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
these buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . if you load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be app@@ ended to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for one of the languages listed here . click the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl ; button at the click of the mouse .
if a value is entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter multiple programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs you get with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must leave you om@@ itted . if , for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID cop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 indicates , you may only enter copy .
the string translation filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter apply when they match . if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string translation filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . thus , the words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides .
in this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package ambig@@ u@@ l .
XML ; Trans@@ forms translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ S@@ LT files from one format to another format . X@@ S@@ LT ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such trans@@ formations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible through the PAT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough .
with the speaker selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card board speaker , or to a speaker with certain features . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read from a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text attached to the filter , it searches a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program specifies which the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card board speaker . with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the selected speaker .
if a value is entered here , the filter is applied if the text contains the typ@@ ed regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call this one by clicking the button to get help when entering .
to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected that best meets the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to save or load your subscri@@ ber settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , from &amp; k@@ de ; , with which programmers can give T@@ TS capabilities to their applications . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD through &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice syn@@ thesizer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this syn@@ thesizer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; see the complete documentation for both APIs on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ su@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of the text for reading and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands , type
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; Window . first start kt@@ ops in a window , then kt@@ z@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers support my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; XML ; trans@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read .
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone to enable S@@ able to work at all . you must do it yourself if you do not use this voice for reading web pages . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found using the environment variable PAT@@ H .
certain signs or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks appear to cause errors in the syn@@ thesizer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing @-@ wel@@ sh is spent . what can I do about it ?
first make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be fixed by a string translation filter .

the voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you will find in the corresponding documentation or on the relevant web pages . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source file archive , you can download the package with &amp; kt@@ ops ; find it in the folder kt@@ ts@@ d . in addition , you can find the source code of k@@ de@@ amon under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .

American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibi@@ bio .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
the list of languages listed above may be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . hence , consult the description of the syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . also check the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that are not yet included in this manual .
the &apos; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &apos; program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand and extend for the use of another syn@@ thesizer , contact the developer team .
the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile and manage , you need a current K@@ DE development environment ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the c@@ lei@@ bs package and the speech files for the &apos; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &apos; program .
if you have the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source file for k@@ de@@ x.@@ html or downloaded the tar@@ ball each night , compile and install the program with the following commands :
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check whether speech syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are working properly with your speech syn@@ thesizer . to do so , you can use the shell script sp@@ d @-@ conf .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed so that the setting of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ chers is directly possible and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer required .
a long text is dis@@ assembled into individual sentences ; the user can go back to sentence or paragraph , repeat the output or stop the output .
for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it will be used , otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen . if you want to know more about how and des@@ kt@@ ops ; select a speaker you will see in .
if you click on the Add @-@ on tab to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card menu will be displayed . for example , the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in PAT@@ H , you just have to enter festival .
select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival . when voices are known , this setting is automatically done . generally , Western languages are ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders , you adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regul@@ ators and show this grey , the voice you choose will not allow these settings to be selected .
some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with larger memory consumption ) the first set will be syn@@ thes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker ( or forget to click on Apply ) .
if this check box is selected , the program window appears at the start of t@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the icon in the system section is visible after the start , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t work yet , it will appear in the system area once K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here all orders in the queue are listed , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the currently processed set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board speaker .
with the buttons in this row you can proceed to or from the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) .
with a click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system segment . then click on this icon to display the program window again .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ code , click on the Audio tab . see also .
only text orders are listed and managed . screen re@@ a@@ dering , warning and messages are not displayed . read more about &amp; kt@@ ts news types ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled , either without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; des@@ kt@@ ops ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ code for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are shown in the list , you must install at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds approximately half and 200@@ nbsp ; % approximately the double normal speaking speed . to allow these adjustments to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click Apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; t@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
on this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ops ; processes four types of voice orders :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders . after the issue of the screen reader is read , the received orders are resum@@ ed .
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ oun@@ ces messages . if you are &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a web page , you can start with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who is entering the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning , or the output of a screen reader , add &amp; kt@@ ts ; insert the audio output into the queue .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory message are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this tab only apply to normal text orders . there are no special actions for messages , warnings and screen re@@ a@@ vers if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority .
to start with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read K@@ Noti@@ fy messages , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card notices will appear .
check this check box to disable the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not selected , the other settings are disabled and &amp; des@@ kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played are not pre @-@ read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . when you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list .
this event will read the message , conversation &amp; conversation ; sent when someone men@@ tions your nick@@ name in an IR@@ C message .
all events , for which nothing else is stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts .
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; hits ; to do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker that will be shown on the list of the speakers as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the Event All noti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can set the noti@@ fications you want to read as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the Load button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voices , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of e.g. Ab@@ brevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; t@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the standard voice , the festival is used when issuing SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ ft@@ . % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds can start text into individual sentences . this allows you to start typing faster with reading , since only the first set has to be syn@@ thes@@ ized , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this directly .
here you see the punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ops ; as default a set @-@ limit recognition filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add other set limits detection filters , but beginners will not be dis@@ cour@@ aged .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting it . switch off the speaker selection and enter text for reading . switch the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changes . of course , you must have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ops ; then you can start reading faster , since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time ,
you can then stop or ab@@ ort text orders on the card board , even if the voice syn@@ thesizer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the regular punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be shut down , only removed . do not change anything to that filter unless you know what you are doing .
punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filters compare text with a regular expression for punc@@ tu@@ ation and insert a tab@@ ul@@ ator mark ( decim@@ al code 8 ) at the pro@@ posi@@ tional boundaries . note that the standard by@@ laws identification filter retains the punc@@ tu@@ ation .
S@@ BD @-@ filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warning messages , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders .
if you have removed the normal punc@@ tu@@ ation detection filter from mistake , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in it .
on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection tab , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . the card is displayed if
use of the default speaker ( the highest on the card board speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
use of the most suitable speaker , which has all the characteristics of an appointed speaker . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that best meets the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this feature does not matter , enter nothing .
mark this check box if the property is to take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set multiple markers here .
since the language is a critical factor in the output of the output , it is always treated as a priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is that a certain application will send text in a different language than the one set in the working environment .
to use all the features in the field of speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the Standard Spe@@ aker button and then use the Spe@@ aker closest to the following .
in this case 0 is the last word order in the queue . you can also specify an order number . ( without the order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ tracking .
G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command recently @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved this is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time . if I stop a text assignment , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message stating : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts with AL@@ SA are likely to occur , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) on www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an extra voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ z@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ su@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ ue / vocals . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL where you found the voice to the developer .
on the Audio Card Audio there is a setting speed . to make this work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be found via the environment variable PAT@@ H . some Syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ modul@@ s such as Festival Interactive even offer a setting for speed . depending on the selected voice , it is active or in@@ active .
the settings for speaking speed are ignored when &amp; t@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ reading . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML re@@ forming filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice .
at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the Tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . in order for the festival to produce no errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags to convert from SS@@ ML to S@@ aber . the same also applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added an own string translation filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the index er@@ un@@ ner jobs is shown , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
you may not filter out punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) . instead , use a punc@@ ture limit@@ er filter instead .
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org )
G@@ Stre@@ amer in version 0.@@ 8.@@ 7 or later . note : make sure that the modules are registered for G@@ Stre@@ amer by calling the command recently before using G@@ Stre@@ amer . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer .@@ fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org )
some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with AL@@ SA . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ops ; in addition , if you stop a text order and then start another one . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the AL@@ SA website ( d@@ mix ) .
with July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read before .
the audio @-@ program so@@ x is used for general setting of speaking speed , but otherwise it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included .

the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default . some of them have a runtime dependence of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of Deb@@ ian distribution ) .
as default , it is installed in / opt / k@@ de@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify as the --@@ pre@@ fix = target . for example ,
on Deb@@ ian systems , / usr / local is the right folder for programs that are translated from the sources .
add @-@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs &apos; s @-@ apps make @-@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd &apos;s make su make install
before you use &amp; kt@@ ts , first check if your voice syn@@ thesizer works properly . follow the instructions that you have received with the syn@@ thesizer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported .
you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read web pages , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on .
this voice requires Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or later . the voice is still in an early stage of development . if you set up the Russian voices , you must enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
the festival is usually included in the distri@@ butions &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , please check the CDs of your distribution first .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then festival takes over le@@ x@@ kal@@ ische Analyse and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded by
note that MB@@ RO@@ LA is not a complete language extraction system . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival produces these from &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also create di@@ phone from German text . more information can be found here .
in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder but in the folder festival / li@@ b / .
I@@ MS German Festival is a changed version of Festival for German and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; Vo@@ ices . required either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival from
instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded .

load at least one German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folder .
either copy t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the filen@@ ame .
on the Device menu , select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o properly .
EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer for the Czech and Slovak language . it is a simple language syn@@ thesizer with even sufficient vocal quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can only adjust the volume in this voice syn@@ thesizer .
start kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr . on the map tab , click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ s T@@ TS speech syn@@ thesizer . if the EP@@ OS programs are not in your PAT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card board speaker . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter an epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get further information .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener voice syn@@ thesizer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you must install the Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; can not set pitch , volume nor speaking speed .
the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any voice syn@@ thesizer that can be controlled on the command line .
it is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device
this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; that allows the administration of network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings .
the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
after installation , a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; start .
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices installing and installing Linux will be installed and set up . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be charged by adap@@ ting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index . when starting the module network settings , this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be detected , the manual selection is offered . it is possible to select the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and relations status . by selecting the setting non @-@ again the definition can be made permanently . next time the network settings are started , this selection will be pres@@ et automatically .
changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are gray , which means that the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three tabs :
the Ri@@ der Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the Ri@@ der Network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up in the list and click the button to set up the desired device ... to be edited in the Device Dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode sel@@ ects the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings are required for the system startup at the same time . the DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start , so no further setting is required . in the selection list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP will be selected according to the system .
the manual can be used without dh@@ c@@ p or BO@@ O@@ TP to configure the TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field network mask the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface when bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desirable , this option should not be activated .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict .
network devices can be activated or turned on as needed . switching on a switched off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
network devices can be activated or turned on as needed . switching off an activated network device will be de@@ activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface ....
specifies the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which communic@@ ates the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer asks ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator is a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or altered . DNS records can be re@@ arranged in the list by selecting an entry and upgrade or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Add or Down buttons .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator for name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list of names known by name describes host@@ name to IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS servers are available . in small , completed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
normally , the list of names known by name contains some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in the future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add new alias dialog will appear .
enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button . if the familiar computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry from a name @-@ known computer from the list and select Edit .... This dialog will display the familiar computer .
it can be done one of the following tasks , then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system . in order to activate the changes , the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( mostly rpm packages ) it is sufficient to install and k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a graphical interface tool such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not only , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things .
this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given , and in the second chapter all configuration files are discussed .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is communicated .
IP networks are currently operating with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 5 has never found a big spread . IPv@@ 6 is expected to be implemented in the near future , and this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is as@@ cer@@ tained . in external networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the point of contact which provides a valid IP address or , if available , DH@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible .
of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range of 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 PCs .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is required for IP forwarding .
the 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 network address is reserved for the IP traffic in your local machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle .
in this part , there are the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections , so it won &apos;t be surprised if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections .
for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

recognizes &amp; c@@ dat ; the pre @-@ tension@@ er , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the band index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been inserted . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be brow@@ sed by un@@ folding the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , first the integration must be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; k@@ dat ; specifies by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been loos@@ ened and shows in the status bar a corresponding message . the tape can now be thrown out without danger .
before a tape can be used by &amp; k@@ dat , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a tape must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . if your tape drive requires a format@@ ted tape before use , this must happen before you can be format@@ ted from &amp; k@@ dat . floppy tape drives usually require format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives are not format@@ ted .
after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat arrives ; with the format of the tape . all data on the tape are lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile will be backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been started , the Settings dialog opens . in this dialog , you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings .
when you have confirmed the settings , the Security dialog appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check ....
once the test is started , the dialog box appears for verification . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for verification .
when you have confirmed the verification , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before re@@ directing the restore , the files that need to be recovered must be selected . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ....
once the restore process has been started , the restore dialog will appear . in this dialog , you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery .
once you have confirmed the restore settings , the restore dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re @-@ create the tape inde@@ x@@ file using the tape content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of tape :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current folder where the backup should be made . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder .
for all the files listed under backup files , only the files in it are backed up , which are located on the same file system as the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be assigned separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others .
to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; s ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted , and dat - before the tape is mounted , load the load to the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if the option is turned on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tries &amp; k@@ dat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tries to lock the ej@@ ection from the tape drive . it may not work on all tape drives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the option is turned on , the tape is automatically ej@@ ected when you delete &amp; mount the tape . do not use this option on floppy Stre@@ am@@ ers .
is the option turned on , tried &amp; k@@ dat ; to change the hardware @-@ calibr@@ ated block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you must &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive .
when &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape is format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , with host@@ name being the full name of the system on which the tape has been format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the time the tape has been format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a tape is mounted .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log enables experienced users to quickly access to information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; hence attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . this includes :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; provides functions with which the single protocol lines of a log file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after startup , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first , the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will not appear to you , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; very probably not started with system administrators . the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criteria or by entered strings . to do so , enter a string into the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in default , a log line will only display if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns .
you can of course also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column . for example , in the log file system protocol , select the column process , and also enter the name of a process in the log file , so show &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log @-@ lines sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important log @-@ lines . log @-@ lines of level errors are displayed with a more con@@ spic@@ uous color as log @-@ lines of level hint . the colored representation of log @-@ lines can be turned off an alignment dialog .
if you just want to display a particular process ( for example in the system log or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can be useful , for example , if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use Filter Panel .
in addition , you can select to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new log @-@ lines added .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display several log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own web page on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of the &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and also named so ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ;
the System V In@@ it is quickly becoming the standard for controlling the program start when starting the system in the &amp; Linux ; world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it .
I &apos;m not going to address historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about myself : - ) .
the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because perhaps someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and re@@ format@@ ting it . Linux ; kern@@ els first look under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc rather than directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole set of scripts . basically , you need a script for any system service you wish to start when you restart the system or switch to another running level . however , system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls are after r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be located under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , which has to do with the serial port .
the kernel searches for the in@@ it at various places and starts the first one that it finds .
the standard running level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . in the beginning section you should see a line like the following :
at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change this , you can edit / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . if you have mess@@ ed up , you can fix it by rest@@ art@@ ing the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how does it start and stop in@@ it system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts manually by hand on the command line :
this would hold the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a k , the script is called stop with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script is called with the start argument .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could &amp; eg ; a server running level that runs only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level that starts &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or a different pointing device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six Run@@ time levels to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will only be removed from its original running level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they extract an entry from the available system services .
note : items are moved if you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target range of the action .
the sor@@ ter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ter numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas ( Available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry to a different running level , move it with cut to clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired running level with past@@ ing ( with C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sor@@ ter number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to switch the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before exec@@ uting them .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise , they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ ners , and now the machine is constantly changing . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single @-@ user mode . then edit the / etc / in@@ it@@ tab file and change the standard running level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under run@@ level X , but they are not executed .
if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( DL@@ D ) , you need to edit additional files in / etc , which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distri@@ butions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using another distribution , please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply termin@@ ate without notice if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even vary from version to version . if you use another distribution , please send me information about the Run@@ time , so that it can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter custom@@ ization of &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading .
after you have made changes , you need to save it . you can either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save In the File menu .
&amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two tabs , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . the user or group properties dialog will appear .
some cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings . only if you have enabled wild@@ card restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card board will be created on which you can make individual settings . additional card cards appear if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the card password manager appears if Shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD Uni@@ xes .
this card only appears if space limitation ( quot@@ a ) is enabled and initi@@ alized for at least one embedded file system ( identi@@ fiable by the quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group file on the file system ) . here , parameters can be modified for each user , with the limitations of the space in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation
the map card group informs about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Prim@@ ar Group field . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field .
the group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the Add Add button on the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group works analogue .
with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove , and change boot password , change time to boot of the standard operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more .
