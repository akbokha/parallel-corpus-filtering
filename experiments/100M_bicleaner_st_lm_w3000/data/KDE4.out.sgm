<seg id="1">"" "translate the module" "" "translate" "" "website in the & konqueror;" "" "translate" "" "menu under Tools website. select the source and target language of the translation from the list." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part will be translated in place of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Mechanical translations are very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, the translations should not make important decisions, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only webpages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated by yourself on the Babelfish page, where you can insert translated texts directly.</seg>
<seg id="5">Package & package; includes various modules for & konqueror; despite their small size they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some features of & konqueror;, by making these easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual on & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Setting up extensions.... Open the card box tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard settings from the package node; addons. please note that there may be more modules installed on your system if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror, before compiling this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click on the & konqueror; click Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or delete the list of crashes, if any.</seg>
<seg id="11">The View Filter module (also called Folder Filters) can be reached in the & konqueror; menu bar under Tools View filters. with the module you can filter and konqueror; the current working directory can be filtered in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To use the DOM tree view in the & konqueror; select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with the DOM of the currently displayed web page. as default the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documenta element, all other nodes are sub elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; displays another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory on local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The special feature of & FSView is to map nested folder hierarchies using a so-called tree map. tree maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">At & FSView; the size reflects the size of a file or folder, whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files, even then easily detected, if they are far down in the folder hierarchy. thus, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX shell command.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the treemap representation is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle over View color mode can represent either depth for easy detection of nesting depth or mapping of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property, you can choose whether or not it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space available for displaying, or whether the area of subordinate rectangles is to be used. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For treemaps, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. at the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained. frames are drawn in order to make the nesting of entries, and this frame will need space that will then lose space for the frame if the rectangle is square.</seg>
<seg id="20">How dividing the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here it is possible to divide the areas in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive division.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can specify the minimum represented area for an entry over the menu item View Anhold on Area. instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the higher-level entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally was & FSView; intended as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for KCachegrind application.</seg>
<seg id="23">The picture gallery module can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras image gallery... or with Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the picture gallery module, a dialog opens which allows you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a field of rotation to set the number of miniatures of each row in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="27">With the box name of the image, display whether the file names are shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="28">View the file size of the image to see if the file size is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="29">With the image size check box, you determine whether the size of the images is shown in the thumbnails in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="30">In the folder, select where the gallery will be saved and which subfolders should be included.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the Save In file selection, specify where the HTML page is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="32">With the check box to include subfolders, you can set with a slider or a control panel to which level the subfolders are included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy the original images to the gallery and copy the original images to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Use the comment file check box to specify a comment file for capturing the images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Own color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The module & HTML; Settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The module & HTML; settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Tools HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>
<seg id="38">The media playback for the navigation pane can be viewed in the & konqueror; menu under Window Navigation Section or with the keyboard shortcut F9.</seg>
<seg id="39">To play, click in the navigation panel of the & konqueror; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Changing browser recognition adds a menu entry in the & konqueror; in addition to which you can change browser and operating system identifiers for individual domains. this is helpful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser recognition of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change browser recognition in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that deny access with browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to consult with the & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or use their own & HTML; - elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identifier of this obsolete browser.</seg>
<seg id="44">This option uses the browser identifier for all pages of the site you are currently viewing.</seg>
<seg id="45">With the menu entry... you can set the scope of the information about the browser used and the operating system in detail.</seg>
<seg id="46">With this & konqueror; module check your & CSS; -style sheets and & HTML; -Documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3C and other standards.</seg>
<seg id="47">Check the module website in the & konqueror; check menu under Tools Site. you can perform the following tests:</seg>
<seg id="48">With the & HTML; check if your & HTML; document of the syntax of & HTML; conforms to all found errors are displayed. with this review, you can make sure that your pages are correctly displayed by all browsers.</seg>
<seg id="49">Allows you to review your & CSS; style sheets embedded in a & HTML; - or & XHTML; document included. with valid & CSS; your web pages have a uniform appearance regardless of the browser used.</seg>
<seg id="50">Checks the links on your page on retracts and faulty links. recursively all links on the website are checked.</seg>
<seg id="51">Here you set the addresses of the servers for checking your & HTML; -Documents and & CSS; -style sheets.</seg>
<seg id="52">With the module Web-Archivierer for & konqueror; you can save web pages with text and images in .was format.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and get your photos directly into & digiever; albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digicam; includes a fast image editing with basic image editing tools. you can use this to review, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. editing capabilities can be easily extended with KDE Image plugin interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although it is easy to use, it provides dozens of professional capabilities. it works completely in 16-bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion via libram, DNG export and ICC color management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; through the camera or the lens to be searched for.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like everyone & kde; programs are also digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvement possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="60">& digicam; tries to make the report of problems or improvement suggestions as easy as possible for them. wherever you are in the program, the Help menu provides a chat with a underlined link. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that is, the user and developer help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam, then we would like to encourage you to answer questions to other users of & digikam. in this mailing list, however, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage visit to learn news about released versions and other information about & digibugs; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to join & digikam is to sign up in the developer mailing list. instructions to announce in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you merge; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your images and your database. simply enter a local, remote or remote folder. simply enter path names or click the folder icon Folder icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field you need to specify a local folder on your computer. here the data abnk is stored. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you would like. & digicam; will also use you as an Albenbibliothek. customize Setting Up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains pictures as a base folder. & digicam; viewing every subfolder as an album. no picture is changed.</seg>
<seg id="68">& digicam; thirsty recursively recursively the library path in all its depth. you cannot exclude subfolders unless it iste in hidden folder. this you can do extra & digiplug; do this by inserting a dot in front of the subfolder name.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have any photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and put it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can join & digicam; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My Keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">Raw file support: if you use the raw mode of your camera, it may also handle it. support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help menu help resource support.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the Roh-Decodersettings and Roh workflow sections.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided to enable you to connect to your digital camera and get your photos directly into & digiever; albums can be downloaded. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the library gphoto2. of course, any medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work together with & digikam.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. the camera is often used as a disk device. the connection can also be realised via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may also use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">Digicam; uses the gphoto2 program to communicate with digital camera. gphoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras which supports an ever increasing number of more than 800 cameras. gphoto2 also supports the picture transfer protocol, a widespread protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. as photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and performs the transfer of images with gphoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support so that the preview images of digiKam can be reliably read. if the exif support is not present in libgphoto2, thumbnails will eventually be unable or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things to do, is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugin interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digibugs;, KPhotoAlbum, Showimg and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way as a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier to digiplug; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes to & digibugs; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; or switch to F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in a different part of the Albenjar, above the horizontal dividing line or into another application window. the only restriction is that a picture cannot be stored in keywords, date list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- A file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed you can configure in the AlbenSettings dialog.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlipiquot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos taken by & digikam are stored in a single albumtree. these albums can be sorted by the folders where they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the album properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select album Import Images. you can also add a screenshot to an album.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from an album to another, you can drag and drop the picture with your mouse onto the target album. in the then appearing menu you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album features, right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album collections: are a method to select your albums so that you can group under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos by selecting From Collection from the toolbar or sorting albums Up collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the settings for collections.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View Albums Records by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">Buttons Elder, Average, New Year: these set the date on the oldest, newest picture or the average of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of the pictures from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of last modification of each file will be used in this folder instead.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first put an album in & digiplug; open, the first picture in the album will be selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlipiquot; this shall help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you must click the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be contained in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">Digiplug; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window will provide you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images will be shown in this album in the image window. each photo will be displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifier buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you need to wait a short while while the thumbnails are generated. this can be avoided by using the Tools menu in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview. what information these are can be edited using Setting Up Settings; Setting up the Albums page and customize the preview images to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. if you leave the mouse pointer a moment over a picture. the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo. the screenshot at the top of the introduction to the main window displays such a help window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are all that it is done with & digitized. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to them. you can reach all the functions that are done with & digiever; you can choose between viewing the images, a slideshow or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by either editing either F4 Image Edit... or the right mouse button context menu and Edit.... in the Edit section, you will find a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view and change your photos.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that digicam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type submenu. this, and how to customize it to your needs, if your program is not listed, you will find information in the & kde; manual.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image processing programs, it can cause problems with the metadata in the image. some programs do not save these data with when you save the changed image. thus, this information is lost from EXIF and IPTC data, such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digicam; provides two options for rotation. the easiest way is to click on the preview and rotate. in the sub-menu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, you can right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you retain the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc.).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you want to delete a photo, it will be moved into the garbage bins of & kde; moved. F8 Image Delete or Delete In case you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Delete.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumslipquot; organizes your photos on the basis of the data. & digicam; uses either the EXIF date or, if this is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view. you can select days or weeks in the datasheet below in the date view to show you only the photos of the selected days.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provided a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. keywords are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search.</seg>
<seg id="110">If a keyword is selected, all photos that have been marked with this keyword are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted into a hierarchical tree. by doing so, you can organize your keywords logically. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword list; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned cue within the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. thus, you can also use your keywords in other programs.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by right-clicking either on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked on an existing keyword, it becomes the forearword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking the cue with the right mouse button and selecting Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the cue is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and dropping it. then a menu appears giving you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can only be in the tree at a time.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by right-clicking it and selecting keyword editing in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in tree & quot; My keyword;.</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select as an album preview in the context menu. additionally, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">This can be done in two ways: once you have selected the photos that you want to use with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword. alternatively, you can also right-click on the thumbnails and select cue from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can tag a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. this way you can give a cue for each person in a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword in which you right-click the contextual menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows you the keywords that were assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The timeline view shows a time-dependent histogram of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame, you only need to click on the lower rectangle of the selection box that displays the time unit. this will display all the associated images in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below you can enter a title and save your selection, which will appear in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, ratings, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps and more in the future.</seg>
<seg id="125">When you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all the images will be displayed again. if the search hasn't found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with binoculars. if you open this, you will get a simple search box as described above. however, you can save this search here as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criteria. after you have been saved, it appears filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be executed. the search list will be displayed in the main window in the View My search list. if you want to change your selection after searching, you just need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you choose to edit search, the form to enter search will appear again with the search information previously entered. if you select to edit as an advanced search, the dialog for advanced search will appear to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced search tool section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete search in the Search context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an advanced search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digibugs; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the AlbenDatabase. all rules are added by line, separated by operators. an option can be added to this list by search group / delete group. each option can be associated with others via the logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... You can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">Digicam; characterized by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the smaller the difference between two signatures, the more they correspond to each other. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop every picture to find a similar. by means of a swellus, the result selection can be enlarged or decreased. if you push a picture from anywhere via the symbol of inaccurate search in the left sidebar, it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: free hand color sketch: draw a quick sketch and digitisation; find the matching pictures. also here a threshold can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can zoom in or out or hold it with the mouse wheel. press Ctrl; left mouse button to move a square. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed. of course, this presupposes your pictures Geo data.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digicam; provides an illuminated table in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, including raw files.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L Add the luminaire from the context menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opens. if you are back in the Edit window; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview pane you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right pane of the window. a small arrow indicates which copy in which window is visible. if you can select a preview synchronization from the toolbar and perform zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then they are also executed with the other image.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images. if you are using pairs of images from the toolbar, then the first two images will be automatically loaded into the realms for comparisons. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to view it in the right pane. this makes it easier to browse through a series of similar pictures.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal deletion actions also work directly from the light table, e.g. F4 file processing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to combine visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">In the bottom end of each area you will find a built-in swivel function that you can see on the crossed paths. in order to wave the visible area of the picture, you need to click it and hold the & LMB. in mode Preview both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">Zoom in the same way as in other views. simply use the zoom slider under the pictures or ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom into the picture and zooming out. this happens in both pictures when previewing in the mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - apart from the fashion word? digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to the final output and the permanent storage. each of the photos records, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. however, most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips on how to backup, find, protect and reuse photos. here we focus on the procedures for digital photographers that & digikam; use. we consider downloading, renaming, removing, filing, filing, archiving, optimising, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digital Stock Management assumes, indexes, categorizes, assures, searches, transforms, assembles and exports contents that have a monetary or cultural value. quot;</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data on data. in accordance with your definition, metadata is data that provides information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not need to find a certain photo for longer. if you don't even know how many photos you have, then use not & digicam;. the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure information structure in contrast to the data structure. you must decide whether other access to your photos should have, whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">The rest of the photos will be organized on the basis of your date. if you make enough photos, then you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements such as versioning photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% archives and 5% work files will have and you will not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What types of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or an derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend storing the metadata option in the Edit Settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the corresponding point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change what happens? to do that, it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are, of course, the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work begins, as you should now assign cue points, captions and a rating to each photo. of course you can select all the images that you need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos when you work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let's now start with keywords, keywords like you frequently refer to other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then & digicam; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a sub-tree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digikam; updates as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graphic shows how different metadata overlap. this is a very rough representation, since each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. file names and calendar data are characteristics of all the images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to inscriptions or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of you don't want to see your photos simply, you want to share them with your friends, family, other photographers and agencies. they are certainly interested in how your photos arrive.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama. if you look at it closer then start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start to dream, have associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you may even hear the silence. so the labeling has completely changed your perception of this panorama.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who look at your photos, the title might be more important than the image itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transmit the meaning to the viewer, to help him understand what you are moving about.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digicam; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as caption. KDE even provides you a spell checker. if you export your images in web galleries, then these captions are exported to your wishes in the labeling and / or the title of the web-gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Do you remember the times before GPS? when you had to find another city without a navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already travels with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already innumerable and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your travels using images with geographical indications. & digicam; can also export kml files that you can open with Google Earth. you can also export the images to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the Google Maps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a prelude with copyright and designates the practice the copyright to remove restrictions concerning the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions, so also for the works of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the Setup page of & digicam; should be stored as information:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to add the photographer's name, e.g. to protect the photographer's identity, the name of a company or organization can be used.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author): associated with the author. this field contains the work description of the photographer. examples of this can be title: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for providers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer is working for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others. if the picture is a stock photo, here the group / agency that offers the picture is given here.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections although they do not provide protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calculator can delete or modify this data embedded in the image. for private persons this is only of little interest to the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">Digital watermark is unique per image. & digicam; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: tableases, disk failure, electric shocks, ECC, transmission errors, aging of storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, lifetime, temperature, data size, spread aberrations</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course, we don't talk about CDs that were lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same ones that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section it's about problems with the so-called new media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the largest data recovery company in the world, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs, these must be treated carefully and you may not trust you for a few years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which last longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that takes a lifetime of 100 years for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD Disks can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk by using good disks and good recording devices and storing them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest, but you write much more reliable. so it's about choosing the right one.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors even if you have just written. that's why they use a checksum mechanism to protect yourself. 75% of the data is only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection they age through chemical ageing, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc.</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs there is a cheap program called IsoBuster which apparently causes miracles for CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged data from damaged disks, hard drives, flash media, USB drives etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also applicable to the Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Read the media with a description, date & author mark and then store them on a clean, dark dry, and protected spot. don't forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Floppy manufacturers maintain their statistics for themselves. their manufacturers' warranties include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives for this issue: disk failure study</seg>
<seg id="187">In brief: disks hold the longest if you operate in the temperature range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. At lower temperature the error rate increases dramatically. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure. SMART errors are the most frequent cause of failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course you can also lose data loss due to a power loss before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric appliances don't matter much, it looks different in devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these abnormalities can cause locked keyboards, complete data loss, hardware design, destroyed motherboards and other defects. protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most widespread protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs part of the energy heat and grounding the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug connector. but remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also ensure that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since there is an overvoltage of each cable to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection, which also includes a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook then you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem. this makes you ideal for on the go.</seg>
<seg id="194">While overvoltage protection protects your system against minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you with a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore make sense to invest in a uninterruptible power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when power failure occurs. some models allow you to store your data and shut down the system. some models allow them to continue working until the current runs. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the supplied software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk your computer system is exposed to and compare its security in case of electricity interference with the costs to avoid this. a high-quality overvoltage protection can cost you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected by it. finally, you should keep in mind how well your computer is protected with it.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration, you can mount it as a drive on & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">They are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home however - 40 GB cost & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data about the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images. this is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are available on photos. their free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want your images in full resolution online.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and included in the large companies offer a backup and distributed storage.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are susceptible to transmission errors. the filesystem ZFS and btrfs ensure at least data integrity between operating system and disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst part is that no one is telling you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disruptions remain undiscovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have thought about it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, as they generate interferences within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are currently not particularly affected by broadcasting problems, you should look into the future. in 2010 you will see thousands of errors per year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates that can deal with plate errors at a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for & Linux; and Windows available. read this article in English.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle started its own initiative with its btrf file system. this is still in alpha state. it uses the same protective mechanisms using ZFS and is also available for Linux; but it is not part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of the data loss on the notebooks and 46% of the workplace systems. in case of laptops, the share of thefts is already 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to a lower damage, e.g. thefts or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less prone to loss of data than proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common filesystems. you can find a very good English article here.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: incorrect, only the speed of the investigation process during a sudden interruption during surgery is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occurred it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the biggest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings removed from fundamental physical limits. this means that while the technology continues to develop, there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are not far away from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go in the direction of 10 megapixel cameras. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and a high-quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras. even DSLR cameras have your limit at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & Euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. therefore, 6% of all PCs are often affected by a data loss. therefore, backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before making any dangerous such as reinstalling your operating system, replacement of disks or resizing hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make every day your backups on an external SATA drive. if, then one day, a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget airplane crashes: fire, water, electricity, children and thefts are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, disaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your fuses up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as already said above is a common reason for a data loss despite security the panic. if you have a backup which is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be secured. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot at two times: one of the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. creates multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup was made. this backup comes closest to an extension system except that it is scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that were actually changed. this is compressed and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Backup important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or another optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This procedure allows you enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time, you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the work files. in the end, you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Themes: metadata, IPTC stored in the image file, retain associated XMP files, original memory, memory, scalability, media, re-invent images and metadata, copy the images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable images survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be followed:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable on the basis of your nature, you must consider all that is said today with caution and re-evaluate while time passes. unfortunately, there is no other way to make a certain vigilance. the less variants you have used in the past, the easier it is to assess the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document. use or switch to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your photos, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the technical expression for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing the size of the system.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. for * nix systems like & Linux, you can copy this area and transfer it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg whether your new disk has been detected by the system but do not hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">& dollar; dd if = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # Source is / dev / sdc & dollar; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollar; resize2fs / dev / sadh1 # change the size of rows if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open Source standards have the great advantage of an open specification. even if one day does not exist any more software that can read it, you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG is much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma and chromaticity data for improved color assignment on heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF required and a slow compression. this format we would like to recommend to you to save your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF has been widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (default). however, some cameras can store your images in this format. however, a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. therefore, there are more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digital Negative file format is a royalty free and open file format developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and obliges to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon will also use it sometime.</seg>
<seg id="241">This is possibly one of the reasons why, in 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block quot; technology of the 90s. XMP stands for & quot; extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to incorporate their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP fits this because it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems when linking the metadata file and the image file, and as noted above, you should consider whether to use DNG as a container and put it all together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models. the activities of DCMI include work on architecture and modeling, discussions and collaborative work in DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far-reaching acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera service, you can use this as a temporary backup.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them in your raw archive. this feature is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">For fine-layered editing you can use external programs. if you edited and edited the images again, you should add the metadata again, which may have been cut off from the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the edited images for copyright with a digital watermark. export them first in web galleries, code into mpeg, use contact sheets, print & etc.</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiever; to get. in the Adding a Photo to an Album, you will find a description of how to add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your AlbenDatabase.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera, connect it to the computer, connect the camera to the display mode and turn it on. see the manual of your camera for more information.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a Finish indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. some cameras do not display thumbnails. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol are displayed on the camera for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before downloading the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface, you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays the file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">This information is the same as with the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image editing. note that this metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All. this charges all photos from her camera to a single album in & digikam;. downloading will not delete the photos and we recommend you check if the pictures were safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all photos, you can select only the desired selection methods from & kde. once you have selected the photos, use the Download and then download Selected. download the Selected button until you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an Option New option is available. these images have not been downloaded and edited until now. in this case, the new images are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new images will be downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons all or download selected files, a dialog will appear to select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and press OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digicam; loads the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the desired photos, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete all of them at once by deleting the Delete All button. if you just want to delete some, you must select them first and then delete Delete Selected.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore photos that you deleted from the camera. the photos are not deleted in the garbage bins of & kde; they should be carefully checked before deleting them from the camera. if you want to completely erase the camera, you should do this using the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">The file names are usually re-used after the photos are deleted from the camera. this can lead to double filenames when you upload photos from different recording studios onto the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was made into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based sub-albums. if you use this option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer opens three more options that are executed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two concern the data about the author in the section Standard Autoridentity. if you select this, the corresponding entries from the exif information are copied into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded pictures.</seg>
<seg id="264">For example, if you prefer a different date format than the default format, you can use the prefix photo-% Y% d% H:% M:% S in the editing field. to do so, switch off the date & time option. for further modifications, you should read the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option camera file names, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase. or in case of capital letters, if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, the digiplug; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera will provide in the preview. your settings for renaming will be saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digicam; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera at the time of recording to perform automatic turning during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar metadata, you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually switched on, and if your camera does not deliver this information, it can be digipated; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">When your camera provides information about the date in which the photo was made available, it can & digicam; this sub-albums are based on the image data. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the section sidebar Meta data you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is normally switched off, and in this case saved & digitized; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you need to turn this option on. use the Advanced button and select the date-based sub-albums at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is to download. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files you want to upload. you can also select more than one file with the standard & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, asked & digicam; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera will appear. select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a generic term in this document. this means a position specified in longitude and latitude and which can be displayed on a map. the data can be determined by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it may be interesting to link an image with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was taken, you can open a browser that indicates the area. if you want to send a postcard to another, users who want to locate the location of the photos, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the location data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields such as direction, saddle and card references. there are at least three ways to achieve this.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know, there is currently no camera integrated with a GPS unit. but there are a few that work with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR Ricoh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or psbabel. however, you must save this data in gpx format as this is the only format supported by the module for geographical attribution.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are various programs for & Windows; and Mac OS, which can extract and correlate the data of images and from the GPS. on the following page you can make the same under & Linux; make: gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you know the longitude and latitude or other data, you can use this script that works with the Excel Tool from Phil Harvey. it uses the delimited coordinates created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, showing all the navigation data for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digicam; tries to give you as much control over his work processes as possible. there are many adjustments that the behavior of & digicam; change. to access these settings, you must Edit Settings; Setting up. the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between them by clicking on the icons on the left.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be displayed on the saved preview or start image editing. you set the default behavior of & digicam; note when you click on an entry in the main screen.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the standardisation and copyright data. these data are automatically written to the corresponding IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also for database synchronisation, these data are written into the IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author title is a synonym for author: this field should include the photographer's profession. these can be designations such as a photographer, a freelance photographer or an independent, commercial photographer.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to provide the one who offers the photo. this does not have to be the author if it works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be registered here because this is the picture of others & quot;.. if the picture is a stock photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions save the data to the corresponding IPTC-Felder. this ensures that the metadata is permanently included in the picture and not only in the digitization database; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save images as embedded labeling (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos, with the captions embedded in the pictures. this allows your captions to be read by other image viewers.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor rests over a file in the main window. depending on the selected option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digiplug; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify what file types & digitization; to show, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list.</seg>
<seg id="292">You can reset the default settings by pressing the Refresh button to the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">Some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is not available. the option & quot; In the whole image size ladenquot; if you have one, you can get better viewing results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the photos shown. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can disable the toolbar if you use the image editing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or brighter colour in the picture. these colors are specified here. in image processing this View Mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma-Subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With Setting PNG compression, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce the image quality since PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast machine, you can set this value to a high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">With the option to compress TIFF files, you can switch the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it has no influence on image quality, since the default algorithm works lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the setting Lossfree JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the lossy setting, the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG. when this paragraph was written, metadata was not yet supported but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In the earlier versions of digibugs, image editing was only a picture viewer for photos. currently, it quickly develops into a tool for manipulating your photos. with this dialog you can change the image editing settings.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default is that all green pixels are the same. if the green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light, this difference creates a lattice pattern in the output. if you use this option, solve this problem with minimal loss of details. this option records the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 lattice patterns with the VNG- or AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the auto color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in the top lights in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the peak lights, so the parts of your images are burned in, due to the inability of your camera to catch the peak lights as continuous white. use the setting through continuous white in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & nbsp; and dcraw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">If you select the Reconstructing option, you will have the option to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and / should therefore be adapted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value to your taste. you probably have to set it a little higher than the default 1. however, this can be done later in the image options of the digicam; image editing. to keep the time for the Demosaicing small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete picture from the partial raw data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color construction.</seg>
<seg id="310">& digicam; and Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (variable number of gradient) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts on the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses, you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for gradient correction since it is carried out during the conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to return it. there is also LCMS and & digikam; information such as the color information from one color space to be translated into the other so that the colors are as exact as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / Start color management module with raw files.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile Folder Set the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC, where you can save all your profiles. & digicam; then examine these folders during startup.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles You have here the option & quot; standard chroot; to deposit for your profiles. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here are only your pictures color-managed not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit to the camera manufacturer and model you use. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, like e.g. Canon, which do not contain any color mapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct conversion at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options such as the Soft Proof profile you can emulate, as your image would be given back by a device. this is very useful before you can print image as your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can be very saturated. this could be corrected manually rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is intended for. unfortunately not with the models of Canon. therefore, here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. of course this answer is inofficially:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal: F for a precise style, L for landscapes, N for neutral, P for portrait and S for the standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface that is supported by a number of & kde; image Viewer and Image editing. by providing this interface, & digikam; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, see a list of available modules. select the ones you want to use, and they will then be loaded and edited. these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings Quick-instructions.</seg>
<seg id="324">More information about KIPI modules can be obtained from the KIPI project at http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper slider adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds well. the other check boxes switch the metadata on or off, which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">On the right side there is a button Automatic detection, trying to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure the camera is properly connected, turned on and in the picture display mode. below are the port settings. currently, serial, USB and USB / FireWire mass storage are supported.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom end, you can set the path for USB and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digicam; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check if & digicam; the camera detects automatically. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera's menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this will be displayed in the main window's menu. if you have more than one camera, you can insert them all here.</seg>

<seg id="335">Various color schemes can be in & digiever; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected under Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs will be listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs are defined in simple text files. if you are interested in a new design for & digicam; create, find more information about this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">It can be used to view and edit your photos and for correction and improvement. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu of the preview and selection of the entry / edit entry.</seg>
<seg id="338">Image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digikam; therefore, you may not be part of your distribution. for more information on the KIPI modules, see the section Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status bar at the bottom of the window, the file name, current file number, zoom factor, and the current image size.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of image processing change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before you have saved file save or the Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the picture.</seg>
<seg id="342">You might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by using Recover from the File menu or the button Restore the image processing Restore in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Nearly every action of the image editing can be undone or restored. the last action you can undo by selecting Edit Recover or Restart by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you frequently use this, you should make use of the keyboard shortcuts, Ctrl, -Z, and Ctrl; Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the Rescue or Restore button in the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu entries, all actions in between are also undone or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, picture high, picture down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you'll be asked if you want to save them.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can enter and zoom in the photo in which you ctrl; mouse wheel or the icons in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To adjust a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: select the magnification factor automatically</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you use the Esc key. normally, you can also edit the toolbar. if you do not want this, you can edit it in the Edit dialog by & digikam; edit the main window. see the section to set up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can select Print in the File menu and get the default & kde; Print dialog. you can customize the settings here before printing your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual pictures or whole sentences. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Printer Assistant from the menu Album Exports. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The digicam; main window has a sidebar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is, without the navigation arrows, also available in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five tabs is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">The text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to the EXIF and IPTC- fields so that you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only supports ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters. all comments are cut after 2000 characters and special characters are converted. if you want to use the IPTC label field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented it, use either the Apply button or simply switch to the next image, the captions are then saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">With this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database, but you can also write the metadata into the files, but this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written in the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The evaluation section shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting. it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or with the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5.</seg>
<seg id="360">The rating is written to the Regency IPTC field. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword list shows a search box for filtering the keywords, the keyword tree and a select box with the keywords mentioned before.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given search word. you can easily restrict the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is another relief when entering keywords in a series of images. if you typed different keywords, they are stored for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword keyword keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main screen and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not the entire selection, if you want to add a selection with a keyword, please read the keyword Filter section.</seg>
<seg id="366">The keyword Filter side bar is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window. normally, the left side bar with their album, - date, keyword and search views is used. if one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two will be displayed. all generated keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also pull and drop keywords. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword is already existing, you can simply drag it from the right side bar and place it on the selection. as a result, a dialog appears that asks you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the images on a calendar day. the keyword filter is on no keywords, which reduces the amount to three pictures. they were selected with Ctrl + a, and then a keyword is drawn from the right keyword tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks if this keyword is to be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more, you can easily change this with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry after which is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, specify an extended search for all elements of the database with the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, just use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the grouping button. the options will then look like this:</seg>

<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I mainly adjusted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors captured by your camera or scanner are predictable deviations from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web to those originating from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">When the topic comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at every point of the image processing workflows. the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with sufficient background information about color management.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow satisfies all six criteria listed below, you do not have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated to the sRGB colour space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other educational editions are by email or web, where sRGB is de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB function so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should you then use another color space and make thoughts about color management?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of sRGB limitation compared to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all the colors we can see, the horseshoe region, and the colors in sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to soundproofing my monitor if I decided to work only in sRGB colour space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you work in the sRGB colour space or not, you must be proofing your monitor, since sRGB means that your; onitor is on sRGB, so you either need to calibrate your monitor to the sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Remuneration and Contrast, Remove from the Correcur Automatic correction to automatically make the best of your colors. you'll need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the fluorescent values over the entire image, so that the darkest point is black and the brightest dot is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">Similar: this method adjusts the luminance factor of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the balance has very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only trash. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in an image or it destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic synchronisation: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light boundary tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram area.</seg>
<seg id="393">Add Contrast: this method improves the contrast and luminous intensity of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jibe of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for bad pictures.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digicam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly limited there over a color space with 8 bits per color. so if you are too far from the original image areas with overexposed can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by copyrighted Pawel T. Jochym. you can start it using the Colors White Balance menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance, then click on the sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is indicated as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">The top right corner shows a histogram that is dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed. the sum is called Luminance.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or even dim the shadow-details of your photos.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press on this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposed indicator enhances the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result displayed in white balance. this is displayed in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly that. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved in a text file and loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences tab returns all the filter values to their default values and the corresponding neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can adjust the encoding depth per color channel of the processed image. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit encoding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the editing of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. mapping can be done by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter color management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under Colours toner correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels simultaneously and allows you to also store your settings so that you can use them for more photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore you always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you will find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digicam; tool color effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar process effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a channel filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, it was called sabatier, also called Sabatier. the colored, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negatives of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar movement. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be generated on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and that works (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquire effect. it differs from a saturation by making it a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquire; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neonlight on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photo. you can try to experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjusting entries can be previewed. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce the saturation instead of increasing it. all changes you can perform can be previewed. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex mold gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool toner correction is located to improve the exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the range of the sliders for the purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph three sliders are clicked into and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to use it is to shift the sliders and make sure that the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right hand side, you can preview the original and preview the image. the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left side are the following options available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: with this box you can set whether the histogram is displayed using a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three controllers: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color tweets can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two controls that can be used to change the output values interactively as with the input values. for example, the compression of the output values can be used to create a fading picture as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be stored in the file system and loaded again later. for this, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically adjusted for all shadows, means and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the preview of the original picture to set the input values of the histogram for red, green, blue and the luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview pane and it is not visible in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below is an example of adjusting the input values applied to the red, green and blue channel of a photo. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original picture is marked with (1) and the corrected picture with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">The left-hand side displays half of the original and the target image. the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings. on the right side the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modifier channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">Next to this box are two symbols to switch between a linear and one logarithmic view. for images taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is mostly the most useful. in this case, the linear mode produces a wide beam. in this case, the logarithmic mode will continue.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a part of the curve to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that darker the image pixels.</seg>
<seg id="436">On the preview of the original photos is a red marker to see. if you move this marker on the area you want to change, a suitable line is displayed on the curve which represents the original value. create a point on this line and move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons you can do exactly this. any curve that you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons create automatically the control points of the curve for all channels of shadow, middle and sun tones. activate the color pipette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if more than one channel is found in more than one channel, you get the combined result displayed. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview pane and it is not visible in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sunshades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original picture is (1) and the corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the digitization; image editing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the color channel mixer of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">With the channel selection box, you can select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left area of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed as compared to your own tab.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the image, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are at the bottom right: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate Luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as well, as the channel mixer is then THE tool for creating great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color results in a visible noise coming from the farther. color-brewing consists of small noise artefacts that do not appear at the same place in the color channel and whose noise patterns look different in each channel. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion by reducing the color space first.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any mixer setting can be saved for later and then loaded. the used file format is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overlay Indicator option controls all color channels to locate overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you only get the effect in the preview pane and it is not visible in the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a picture in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is shown under (1) and the edited image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, since color images can be easily converted to the computer. also with a set of film roll profiles.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2</seg>
<seg id="452">Green Filters: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenery images and fits particularly well to portraits in the sky.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orangefilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves scenery, maritime scenes and air photos.</seg>
<seg id="454">Rotfilter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate lunar scenes at the time of the day. similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) Rotfilter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color tone correction and improves contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiphaton: produces warm and medium sounds while adding a little coldness in the shading troughs. this is very similar to the fate of a pressure and the re-development in a sepiatonic. this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and therefore similar to the 005 cokin (tm) sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">Using the & digicam; applying tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color picture or not, you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas, the engraving of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mural on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: shift this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect is applied on the photo below. the original picture is (1) and the modified under (2) to see. the parameter relief has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digicam; tool frame can be added a decorative frame around a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of a viewer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, you set the desired frame type for your image. walking through the image with a colored line, Niepce dends it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), rounded it with a nice three dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the value range for the width is limited from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original but have the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the pictures, especially if you have used the tool after aspect ratio before.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into an image at any position. this is also possible in several places when you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply enter the text and place it with the mouse. use text direction, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button "OK." once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digicam; use tool stencil you can put a template across a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu can be used in image editing can be used to lay templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding size and orientation. however, you must take the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template of the digicam; template database, just send an e-mail in English to the digikam; mailinglist digikam-users @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your template folder with the default folder in the dialog. select the folder in which you have copied the template files. these settings are scheduled for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After the root folder has been set for the stencils, a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder. selecting a folder automatically updates the template's thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="474">Below the preview there are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and the position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the picture below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">It is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you need to resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image underneath the template. to do so, take the picture and place it in the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK when you want to apply the template to your image. the image will then be automatically adapted to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other fields.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but produces fine grainy images especially in dark areas.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blurring mask operates on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper look. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm has been taken from Gimp and it is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjusting.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images need a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitizing process paints color with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn leads to blurred edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when paint spots are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">In JPEG images, a camera has often been used in internal sharpness. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners are already using a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can call the Correcting Field menu entry.</seg>
<seg id="487">The sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image will refocus the tool. you can refocus it using the Correcur menu entry. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to focus on refocusing.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it is to sharpen. use the tool to soften the picture with the menu entry Correcur softness and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration you can see here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. increasing the radius or amount reinforces the effect.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference-amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in order to apply for an edge of the filter. thus areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharper and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred mask filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred blurred was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The digitization; tool refocussing a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. this is a better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filming. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blur mask. refocusing often achieves better results than blurred blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing color refocusing in image editing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the circular fold operates much better than the Gauss's Fate. the Gauss's Fate has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical results also from the source pixelae, which are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Viennese Inverse of the Gauss's Fate is even very strongly influenced by the remote pixels. this causes unwanted results.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures the default value 1 should result in good results.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. the filter can accept values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, and eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a high value will further aggravate the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sharpness: this is the radius for the gauge. use this parameter if your blur is' Gauss'. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the sharpness. note however that the module is very slow if you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not visible immediately, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, Unsharp Masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the blurred masking a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">In theory, Unsharp Masking always has to create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal lineare filter.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small unfocused picture:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The smoothte regulates the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tint allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various pre-settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available Preferences are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine adjust the filter settings you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Conservation of details p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothing over the picture. whereas larger values predominate mainly homogeneous regions and let details sharp. a value of 0.9 should receive details in such a way that no sharpening is necessary subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="520">Directional dependence alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed only in one direction. if you have a film size or CCD hiss, a high value will produce wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above. p then defines the relative smoothness. therefore, set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 suffices.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step size [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is chosen small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles generate a long term. therefore, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integrated step width [0,1, 10]: integral stride length in pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the amount of quality you receive by selecting this option is minimal. it doubles the running time. therefore, we recommend it to be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly that. correcting any adjustment of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how image errors can be corrected with small artefacts. the module is applied in a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a peculiar black artifact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the journey. the original picture is below (1) to see and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The digitization; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information on sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindows details and the subwindows Advanced Settings can remain with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the size of the window, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can blurb the image. the area indicated by the radius is moved over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus smaller errors are cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness of the sharpness. this value sets the pixel distance from the filter to the front to detect light density changes. if it is increased, smoke peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer get image details and noise or lubrication occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edge: controls the edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value near the maximum if you want to remove a weak hiss or JPEG artefacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the image tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically roughened more strongly. however, it also merges the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Damping: controls the adjustability of the phase jitter. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high, the noise and phase jitter will appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save as and load: these buttons are used exactly for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be saved to the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). noise reduction was applied using the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. fortunately, the solution to draw the picture a bit soft is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften the image with the menu entry Correcur softness and experiment with the smoothing. the preview window on the right side of the dialog displays the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The digitization; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to lessen photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß'sche rushing, film grain, scratches, compression artefacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG artifacts reduce: the compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far away from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefaktequot; - small standards that can be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly that. any setting of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="551">The module is applied to a black and white photo taken with a minolta (tm) 700Si camera to an Ilford (tm) HP-5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the notorious film grain on the faces.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photograph that was read by a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is shown under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The digicam; tool Hotpixel allows hotpixels of photos to be removed with a CCD camera gem, eight were removed. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photos, as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixels quot; & quot; light Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark-picture subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Load this file in the wizard with the dark image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera it is important to record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should load the right dark picture to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and automatically load it in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result inside the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all previews.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixels. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Average: an average of the adjacent pixel is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the broken pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photo taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture can be seen under (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The digitization; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, often cannot illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignetting quot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">Many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which may increase the necessary shutter time in such a way that it is impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, as otherwise blurb effects are caused by motion.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposure ranges of today's film and grey gradations of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation to a raw image without this filter. the tool of vignetting corrects the transformation with a center filter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three controllers, you can control the Vignettierungsstelle-Filter and with three further the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or randomly a light intensity of 2, you reduce the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree.</seg>
<seg id="572">Brightness, Contrast, and Gamma Settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the luminosity of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controllers will only provide you with positive values as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the exposure of the target image, let the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the color gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction applied to a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image. a luminous and contrast correction was also performed on the picture with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="575">The digitization; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. color distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree treats the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar effect, but flattens at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient of the fourth graph corrects the removed corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the distortion of the second degree of distortion. negative values can be corrected tonal distortions and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">This value has a stronger effect on the margins than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite sign of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value scaled the image size and thereby leads to a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive the picture decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brightening: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the Preview dialog will illustrate the distortion correction. the values you use for your image will be saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes. best result in this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a toning correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal help line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to fix the dotted lines. move it to an important place, such as the sea side or a building wall, in your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point. subsequently, you can correct the toning / cushion distortion with the help of the lines.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove them using the trimming tool in the Edit menu from the image processing or by the Zoom knob of this dialog.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as photos from the front, frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that when you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the tonical correction applied to a church in Norway. the original picture is shown under (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infra-red film of the GimpGuru.org web page which is available under this URL. the filter reproduces the known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrared film, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters of film grading and film sensitivity (ISO). enable the Add Add Movies if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO control changes the amount of film grain and the dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce infrared film, especially the green duct doesn't make sense to apply the effect to black / white photos, as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared film effect applied to a landscape photograph from New Zealand. the original image is shown in (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film has been set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the more advanced.</seg>
<seg id="595">The digicam; filter film grain is an easy to use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the movies the manufacturers mix large silver baskets of the photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film grading effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift into the past. the treated image gets a timeless ambiance detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, gritty sight especially in your monochrome photos, you must use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, set to ISO-2400. if you still need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film grading effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity is ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The digicam; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The digicam; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still lifes are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two controls to influence this effect. the upper one selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with the (1) and the machined is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The digicam; Filter carbon drawing uses color and intensity gradients to create a carbon sketch. the lines that define the outline in the drawing are emphasized. images whose gradients can change slowly are not ideal for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (flattening).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The digicam; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses an proprietary algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The digicam; Filter engraving is a fast tool to give your pictures back with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray, monary landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the processed image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using distortion effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Wave blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is viewed through blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: analogous to the sundle blocks 1, the image is distorted by a different version of blocks of glass.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require a long time for calculation and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art using blur effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom Zoom: blurred the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one center. this simulates the blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression that is often seen in sport photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center point. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blur: blurred the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to resign in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Blurring motion: blurring the image by horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: photographing from a car or train, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Blurring blurring: blurbs the image softly in the dark and strong tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and brilliant soft focus effect (Hamilton Effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Vibrating sharpness: blurring the image by a random shift of pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color font in the picture and blurbs it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divides the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time for calculation and cause a high CPU load. you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your images a wet look. it uses an algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can use the Edit tool to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. once you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the processed image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools can be found in the Edit menu or Transform Scanning menu.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture if the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you re-invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change the resize size in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to increase a small image with a better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a type of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to increase an image. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflate was developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the new tab, and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: when this setting is activated, the aspect ratio of the original image is maintained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, because it is difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' Turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save as and Load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. enlarging any background for photo can be saved as a text file and loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Inflating photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Been.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of picture inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged image (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement for comparison.</seg>
<seg id="640">Cutting a photo is not only a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to cut a picture you simply need to create the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will see this rectangle when you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo is cut off. this gives you a good overview as your photo would look like after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by dragging at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The cutting button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the Save or Save File menu under the File menu to save the newly cut picture.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog will be retained.</seg>
<seg id="644">In the tool After aspect ratio you can specify the orientation as a high-format or landscape format. in portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross-format of the width are assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">Cutting the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same, regardless of whether you are centimeter, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and its aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog, there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog, you can use the Max. ratio button to set the area for cutting to the widest possible, depending on the selected ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that the EXIF data reflect the cropped image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The context-help settings allow you to blend support so that you can put your pictures together better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonic triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elbow, harmonious triangles are a way to divide a rectangle in similar harmonic triangles at the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that affects various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks who constructed your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number derives from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle. a composition that follows this rule is considered visually harmonious.</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides liquid help lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos. compared to the third-hand gel, the golden spiral generates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this type of composition leads the observer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this kind.</seg>
<seg id="656">A further rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to deflect the golden spiral. there should be something that the eye can divert to the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonal to these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use gold triangles to break up your frame, you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="659">The horizontal mirror and mirroring options can be used to mirror the harmonics.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the help lines can become invisible. this way you can customize the color of the lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">When you make a photo, it's easy to keep the camera vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the digicam; image editing and the tool free rotation. to do this, select Transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your picture with the slider angle. the values on this slide are indicated in degrees. with the Preferences knob, you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and a vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after you have moved it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous sections.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to fix this is to use the function Transforming Cutting out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the picture is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliases option flattens the image a bit after the rotation. but be aware of the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective, you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New Width: displays the width of the new image, including empty spaces created by transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: shows the height of the new image, including empty areas created by transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees in the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees in the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle Right down: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image gets a bit blurred. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adjustments create a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After adjusting the perspective you get unpleasant triangular holes in the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the picture with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite direction. for example, a horizontal string will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module by transforming scissors.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shoot your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect is displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">For your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your picture.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shear, the image becomes a bit blurred. for a single shear this effect is usually negligible, but two activations are twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After lubrication the picture has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate them is to cut the image with transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats therefore depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled.</seg>
<seg id="684">Due to this dependence on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of any file formats available on their system. however, they will always find JPEG and TIFF thereunder.</seg>
<seg id="685">& digicam; shows only files in formats that are familiar with. this is done using the file extension and comparing them with a predefined list. if the extension is listed in the list, & digikam; the file in the editing pane will change; you can change this list of file extensions that & digikam; accept.</seg>
<seg id="686">Almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats: JPEG or TIFF. some cameras even allow you to select the format to use. a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia. & digikam; supports both formats.</seg>
<seg id="687">Image compression is the application of data compression procedures to digital images. in doing so, redundant information is reduced to store image data in a more efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="688">JPEG 2000 is also supported. in general, there are better, smoother results than JPEG at the same compression ratio. the 2000 version can also store lossless when it is specified in the settings.</seg>
<seg id="689">If you want to learn more about the raw image format, you can read under Wikipedia, The Luminous Landscape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful instructions in English. you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF to the raw image converter from & digikam; you can find further information on how to use modules with & digicam;.</seg>
<seg id="690">There are more than 200 raw file formats supported. all supported cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coffin. the table below shows a short list of raw formats from & digikam; supported:</seg>
<seg id="691">Many digital cameras support the recording of short films. these clips are often stored in the AVI- or MPEG format. & digicam; is not a film editing program and therefore has no built-in options to view or edit movies. if you click on a movie file & digicam; the & kde; use settings to play movies to start playback.</seg>

<seg id="725">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program used to view & graphiviz; -dot; -graphs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far there has been no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs that include & graphiviz, are outdated & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with just a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphical viewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all the functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphical viewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphiviz; -dot; -graphs; graphics & graphviz; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphical viewer; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; on. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & kate; recomputes the graph and in & kgraphical viewer; represents)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or open the graph in & kgraphical viewer; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems with about 1000 nodes and a hack to represent more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphical viewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphiviz; tool & dot; for representation of graphs. in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate subwindow. initially, when you start & kscreen viewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list Enables opened files. click the first icon to open the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more & dot; selected files, the main window looks like the screenshot below:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right at pressed & alt; -key);</seg>
<seg id="736">The zooming is limited in both directions by the factor 10. below you see the maximum reduction of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be recharged or whether you want to ignore the change. & kgraphical viewer; can also memorize your decision, so that later it will proceed as well. if you want to change your decision later, you can configure the menu item Settings cviewer; Setting..., see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">When you open a graphene file outside a running & kgraphical viewer; instance, & eg; in the file browser or command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphical viewer; instance or want to display the graphene to be loaded in a subwindow of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but can also change it with the setup dialog subsequently.</seg>
<seg id="741">When you start the program, you can open all graphs of your last session again. again, you can save your choice as well as change it later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph is to be split into several pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be chosen freely.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you are using multiple pages, you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come to a page are to be fitted to this page. the aspect ratio will be ignored. if you maintain the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled in by the respective parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a single page distributed on several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Load page gives the possibility to specify the behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically reload or ignore changes) or consult the program each time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of & kgraphical viewer; specify when a graph is opened outside of a running session. you can set a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or specify that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of & kgraphical viewer; you can set a default behavior (open or not open the files of the last session or not) or to be asked at each start.</seg>
<seg id="748">The context menu, which usually appears at a click in the main window with the & RMBn; opens up additional options:</seg>
<seg id="749">Here you can choose among different & graphiviz; layout algorithms. the entries as described on the website of & graphviz are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of directional graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and then tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge overlaps as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & neato; algorithm is the standard for unerized graphs. it produces representations according to the springtime model. the Kamada Kawai algorithm is used, which is equivalent to statistical multidimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP algorithm generates a springboard model layout for peripheral graphs. it uses the fructose-pure gold heuristics, and includes a multi-point trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm places the nodes circular in accordance with the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Opens a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then run from a shell. the command should accept the Graph file as a parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph to stdout in the xdot format. with such a layout command, you can give special options, or modify the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type to (dot; for directional, & neato; for non-directional graphs).</seg>
<seg id="756">If this setting is enabled, the overview will be displayed if necessary. otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is inactive.</seg>
<seg id="757">Show the What is the mouse pointer. click on a & GUI; element to get further help to this element (if any).</seg>
<seg id="758">A list of changes is available under this address and in the file ChangeLog in the base folder of the source archive.</seg>

<seg id="772">The KIPI module provides tools to read and store new images.</seg>
<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and store new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read pictures from a scanner that supports the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have Kooka and Sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you scan the menu item, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window appears where you can replace the default ducer's default values to select your image accordingly. view the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image. the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure that the window is completely displayed, since some settings may not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the Scan button you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the options of the target image will appear. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore create very large files. you also need to select the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">Screenshots can be created after you have selected Import &gt; Screen shots in the menu. a window appears where you can set different screen photomodi:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select Full Desktop to read in to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts. if you need to switch to other work areas, you should select this delay up enough to have the time to navigate there.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been made, the dialog options of the target image appear with the options described above.</seg>

Flickr makes it possible to send photos to the people who are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world, put photos of your camera mobile online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr module can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. this is used for your authentication, so it is virtually your link to Flickr. a browser is started so that you can login with Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to Flickr web page. the following page will be presented to you after a successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr. this will be shown in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module exports to Flickr for the second time, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions. the module does not currently support other permissions. you will be asked if you want to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button to add photos should be pressed once after you have set all the other options. with this button you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. if you press the Ok button starts uploading the photos to Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The Tags field can be filled with a list of words separated by comma. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI geographical localization module allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. the geographical data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographical localization module provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your images with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and enter the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to allow a possible correlation between time and localization, you need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken back at the same time, as the pictures of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS tracking data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera connection must be converted with GMT. this can be done with the time zone. set your camera line here.</seg>
<seg id="815">The maximum time deviation is an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera time. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you have no trace data from a location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will correlate all images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you do not have matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a great time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these boundaries here and press the button correlated to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog box is marked by a call to the next you just need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and placed with the displayed map. select the region and enlarge it .Add this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and a mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are ways to attach the GPS data to the images. here is a small script that uses the exifttool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI Module Image Gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums you want to export as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded by UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The tab has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the Rider Selection allows you to select all the albums to be exported to HTML. you only need to select these albums. the three buttons on the right side allow you to quickly select a large number of albums.</seg>
<seg id="824">The tab theme defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is mostly self explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your associated images. select a folder where you will have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIXexport, which contains everything, will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original pictures will be saved in the new images as well.</seg>
<seg id="827">Set the default color depth with Other color depth, which of course affects the file size. all other settings are self explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allows you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, that are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window displays the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be closed automatically. you can therefore read the program messages to see if errors occurred during production. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI Viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool for viewing images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Viewer View Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rotation, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons. it has been developed for a fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree Module is a tool to change images without compromising your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to save images in JPEG format for the actions below without the usual loss of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of loss-free storage is that the file size increases as no compression of the color information takes place. this can be found for example also in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI Digital Camera Client is a tool to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI Digital Camera Client has no documentation at this time. if you are interested in writing it, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI metadata editor now has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the kde-imaging @ kde.org mailinglist for the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. select the image that you want to copy in the main program and then enter the import function. it then opens the file selection dialog with which you want to select the destination image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work with all image formats. you can copy from anywhere, but not write to any target format. JPEG is supported in writing. please check out exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Codec Module is a tool to convert a number of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The module MPEG Codec can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length. this module will use the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also insert a basic image transition between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the chosen video format. additionally, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. to burn the medium you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">First you need to select the images to be packed into the MPEG slide show. afterwards, you can create the module via Tools MPEG Slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images you select are then listed under image files in the portfolio, where you can also change the sorting of the images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are happy with your list, you should customize the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you're planning to play the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is preset and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds a picture is displayed. the speed of the image transition is specified below. a low value creates very sudden, a high, very smooth image change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in doubt, you should let it black. you can specify the name and path of the generated file using the name of the mpeg output file. keep the extension mpg as possible.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adapted all settings to your wishes, you can start generating the movie with the button encoding. depending on the speed of your computer, you can now go for a coffee quickly or in peace and enjoy the slideshow once you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a critic appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages by button Settings right below.</seg>
<seg id="852">The print wizard allows you to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. the combined images can also be automatically opened using the Image Image Gimp. this is e.g. useful to improve you or to print with the Gimp module for direct printing.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module you can import or convert your RAW files to one of three JPEG, TIFF or PPM formats.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command line tool dcraw from Dave Coffin. an original quote from it is: do not expect from dcraw that it creates the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with dcraw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the raw file to be converted and run the module. the Raw Image Converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can further process the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A 4-color RGBG Conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the file name remains the same and only the extension will be adapted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you plan to edit your images frequently or later use them, you should not choose JPEG format as it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you choose JPEG as a storage format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Run button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch editing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files automatically. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to recompress all images in an album. it uses the convert program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all pictures of an album. you can set the prefix, the start number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can resize or enlarge the image. to do so, four types of image change are provided:</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in one dimension. the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here the aspect ratio remains unchanged. for example, you can use this option to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not Proportional: not proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing preparation: prepares the image for the photo print. the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, edge size and background color, is adapted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected pictures with your preferred email program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have started the module, the image window will display the images you select. using the Add Images button you can add more images with a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview is displayed on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag and drop images to the picture list to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Button Images, the selected images will be removed from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e-mail client. you only need to add the addresses and the subject. the selected pictures are attached as attachment.</seg>
<seg id="877">Don't mind sending too many pictures at once. most e-mail accounts have limitations on the size of the emails to be sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window is used to change the settings for sending the images. your configuration is saved and used every time until you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your e-mail client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you must specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail Service, you must first install the Gmail Agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats like TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG to JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format, then the original image data will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages on the search for errors. however, your e-mail program will be started automatically at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau, a window appears with questions like you want to display your slideshow. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The option OpenGL-transitions in the presentation activates very elegant image transitions by OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The File Name option will show that the filename of the images will be displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop. you can then manually interrupt the presentation with Esc.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of the pictures in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The distance between the images can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. you should check this before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images selects another effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left edge of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop and start the presentation, jump to the previous and next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module time & date does not currently have documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. Please note: participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI Background picture is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">Once you have provided your images and videos with annotations, you can use & kphotoalbum; Browse these, see image. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, now in each group, thus in people, places and in the group keywords are available.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window, you will see the categories for which you typed information as you have provided your images and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries for looking for EXIF-based information, viewing the folder structure on your hard disk and of course viewing the current thumbnails. in the following each is described for itself.</seg>
<seg id="900">If you click on the entry with the mouse, the view of the browser changes. see image.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images on which both persons are visible are displayed. through this selection method, you can restrict the number of displayed pictures from a few thousand images to a few individual pictures.</seg>
<seg id="902">If you have selected all persons, locations and other settings, you can display thumbnails to view the images of your area of activity.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same symbol in front of her name. you can use & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own preview image, which of course also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined yourself. see the picture.</seg>
<seg id="904">In order to display images next to the names, select the button located on the right side of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display icons with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have any suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you need to specify which image to be displayed for each individual person. to do this, you need to open the picture-view window (in more detail) and select the entry categories editor in the context menu. now you can customize the image for the respective person. in the view window, you can customize the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">If you visit the Find item in the main window, a dialog will be displayed, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog again on the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string into the caption or description field, the captions or descriptions of the images will be searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date to look for; the date can either be part of the total date, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options at the bottom of the window you can browse all images according to specific names as you can see in the picture. click here for images on which Jesper, but not Anne Herene are depicted.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the User's Manual for & photoalbum;. if you don't like to read manuals, but rather want to try out functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & photoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, screenshots and introduction videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & photoalbum; and select the demo in the first dialog, if you start & photoalbum; for the first time, or select the menu item cphotoalbum; -Demo. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the functions of & photoalbum; try.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this manual, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar you can see here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the images in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can show you several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between the units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying the bar only 10 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed thumbnail view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview pane) and also the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed pictures when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select an area of the timeline by holding the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, only images of this period will be displayed in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& photoalbum; provides you two ways to create HTML web pages with your images. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other available as module (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create through the menu File HTML....</seg>
<seg id="918">Before creating HTML pages you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas: content, Layout and Location. in the following, each area is described in more detail.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the overview and a description to contain the HTML file later. on photo album; HTML example pages you will see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next select whether a photo album; export file should be created which is to be seen on the overview page. more information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information to display on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information is displayed, which are obvious to the viewer, even without a description. for example, that all images are from a party. note that all images are currently exported. you cannot use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area, you can specify how the HTML pages should look. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions for the images. this allows those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewer of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area, you specify the different folders and URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">For all your HTML files, select a base folder and create a new subfolder for each subsequent sentence.</seg>
<seg id="927">First you need to select the root folder where all your images are stored. this folder will be saved and automatically added to the location next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to the viewer. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will start after the pages have been created. otherwise, the URL you specify should be the folder. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them to it. in order that the import function, see, correctly works, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The settings described are all three related to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are coming together on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & photoalbum; you can, of course, create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have already spent a lot of time viewing the picture information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc., then you have to go with & kphotoalbum; do not make this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file contains only one shortcut to images. the advantage of saving all the images into the file is that you have all the images together and can pass that file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kin file directly from the File menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, it will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the .kim file folder. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you have created your .kim file with the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">The following is the dialog for exporting images that you can export through the File Exporting menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">"" "in the" "" "Manual" "" "option, copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file." ""</seg>
<seg id="939">With option Automatically copy & paste photo album near the .kim file; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most of the images were already compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files. if you want to do so, just choose the export file option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is to limit the maximum image size. if you send images to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">When you import a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select & kphotoalbum; import the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folder the import images should be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you are the category people of the file to be imported (if you are a domain) while this category is named for your database. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories they correspond to in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step, you can match the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example can be seen on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view pictures: if you look at images, you often want to jump within different picture groups. if you look for example pictures of your holidays and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the images on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will go through the various steps of (1) Setting up the information on your images, via (2) browsing and watching, up to (3) advanced themes and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoAlbum has been started as a program for managing your pictures, but it has been expanded and today it takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual you talk about pictures, but frequently this includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& photoalbum; saves all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of its images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want.</seg>
<seg id="950">& photoalbum; remembers the folder where your pictures are stored and automatically reuse it in future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & photoalbum; with the -c option. for example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">Over the menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; Setting up... get to a window that allows you to change the settings of & photoalbum; in the following section of the user manual, you will be able to explain the various settings options.</seg>
<seg id="952">On the left you can see six different symbols that allow you to view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting, a detailed help is available which can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the option you want.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each picture, e.g. people, places and keywords. you can also create your own groups, such as objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit already existing groups. for each existing group, you can select a caption and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In this section, sub-categories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog, you can set up complete member groups, i.e. all members of a group at once in a group, instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list of options listed above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window you will find a list with the current category and in the right a list of sub-categories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& photoalbum; shares its modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be accessed via the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page, which you can call through the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules are used by multiple applications among each other, it may be that the modules were tested with & kphotoalbum; therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before you use them on your own images. you can either use the command line with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. don't say I didn't warn you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules use together with KIPI are very different, whereby it may be that some modules with & photoalbum; do not work. this is the downside when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & photoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI is that the other applications are just a folder. even if & kphotoalbum; this kind of order does not support, it simulates the order for albums for some modules, so that you can use the functions with & photoalbum.</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album that simply corresponds to the current view, i.e. all pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album must be a photo album; the modules also have a list of albums. here's a photo album; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry of this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you specified in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do, so if you selected persons to view and share this with the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules are with & kphotoalbum; not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the settings dialog and select modules that you want to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you can see an example of a start screen as soon as you start a photo album; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used to with any other KDE application, you will see a menu and toolbar at the top. below the toolbar, you will see the window that you have entered into your image database. in the section, we will return to this window, but first click on the entry images that will show you an overview of all existing images.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & photoalbum; is the ability to provide any picture with notes. this includes information about the persons on the picture where the picture was taken, etc. you can set each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if, for example, on all pictures Jesper is mapped and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want, you can see these notes when using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting individuals, places and keywords. these are a very important part of & photoalbum; because you will always use them again when you enter information about your images.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving the images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 people, you can, by moving the names used up, to find and assign people faster.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to see an alphabetically sorted list, click the Sorting icon by date below the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected notes for each image individually, you may want to edit all the selected images and add comments to these images. in this case simply click on the before and back buttons, which are located under the preview of the picture on the upper right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded multiple images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Several entries at once with a comment.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA. San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">On the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as a group. to show you that it is a group, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the Comment dialog context menu, it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new subcategory or subcategory. additionally, you can simply drag and drop an entry into a category to make it an subcategory of this entry. note, this presupposes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the note dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame. you can also make a separate window from a frame by dragging it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adjusted the appearance of the window to suit your needs, that you are satisfied with the settings, click on the Options button... that provides you among other things the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also completely hide a frame. if you want to get this window again later, use the Options button... and then hide / hide windows. you can see this process in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select Show images in your browser, you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures, or all images if you have not set a filter. you can configure the size of the thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button. just try it.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image is set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the image viewer. if you have not opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the image preview. simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Delete key or select Delete selection from the Edit menu. now the window will appear to you that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& photoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can use & kphotoalbum; namely images even without having to store them on your hard drive. of course you must have saved the pictures somewhere, so & kphotoalbum; you can view the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images where the right upper corner is clipped are not stored on the hard drive. however, the thumbnails are available for the pictures 5-9, so that & kphotoalbum can show you the preview of these images. however, you can't view these images with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this feature requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back. & photoalbum; do not support you until now to ask you to insert the corresponding CD. so, if you want to avoid annoyance on how to avoid mashing your images, please buy a larger hard drive to store all the images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the View menu you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you would like to have a little more privacy, filter the pictures so that at the end the ones you would like to make available to others and click on Current View in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also select all the pictures that your little sister can see, and choose the menu entry Any except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">With this you have defined which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you give the laptop to your little sister, simply select the item entry images, so that all the images you have locked will be hidden. if you want to get the pictures again, click lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select password change in the Privacy Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe. on the one hand, anyone who can access the index.xml file can read or delete the password as an unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & photoalbum; not very familiar looking at private pictures.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you share all your pictures with & photoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is of course that you want to consider them sometime. for this reason, & photoalbum; using a picture _ and video viewer. this you can start from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in. of course, it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered into the picture, e.g. who is on the picture, when and where was it done, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If you want to see the info box on the top of the image you want to see, you can simply drag and drop it with your mouse. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether any information is to be displayed. all these options are available after a right click on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here, the browser will show you matching entries to this. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Helene. as if you selected persons from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and end. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. & photoalbum; loads then a new image after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer from & photoalbum; is it possible to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom into the image and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply move a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus key, you can zoom out the plus button zooming in the middle of the image. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zooms.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key, you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not displayed zoomed. using the uniformity button sets the zooms, so that each pixel corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos are in and out with the plus and minus key.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the scripts from the context menu you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make annotations to the current image with the menu item comments from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at images it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can cancel the view and open configuration dialog of the image to enter this name. however, you may prefer to select only the image and view more images.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see what photos you want you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad, while you look one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the possibility to have pictures with features while you view them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter. in this view you can see a picture in which the characters A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have features on your images, these are available in your browser. so if you have all the images you are editing, printing or whatever selected, you simply add all the images that you have selected, so you can use a module to copy the selected images onto a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in the preview screen. if you can view categories in dre preview view, you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the characters for the feature after the picture was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. in this case you are allowed & photoalbum to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The batch is not saved with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In, you can see a picture on that was drawn. to activate the drawing mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the image from the context menu. to end the painting simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To work with & kpovmodeler; you need to use the application of the program & Povray; not fully control, but the documentation on & Povray; should you have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object in the wireframe views are shown in yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time. but not the object of an object already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object into the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and click either the icon in the toolbar or select a menu item in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are multiple possible positions, the following pull-down menu opens, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can delete selected objects from the scene using either the Edit menu bar or the right mouse button context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to Apply these changes. if you have entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with an error description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or reject the changes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; User documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the property view.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press Preview in the property view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default, the entire texture is rendered, even if you want to render a subordination element. if you only want to render a part of the texture map (for example, a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map), check box locally.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screenshot shows the camera control points. you can drag these control points with the mouse button to change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by dragging with the mouse inside the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the parent object or as an absolute value. objects are displayed only when selected or their level of view is smaller or equal to the stage of view chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window order as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window order or if you need another arrangement, you can set them as you like. you can also store multiple windows orders and simply switch between different orders.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window above or under a view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle will then display the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the button to the right or left side of the view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends across the entire height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views on top of each other, drag the finger in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between the views by clicking on the index tabs at the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window order are floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to resolve a view from anchoring, drag the finger on the desktop or click on the small pointing arrow pointing upwards in the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross at the beginning bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can add additional views to the main window. in the View menu, you will find entries for any kind of views. new views are floating, you can anchor them anywhere.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View Window System. it displays a dialog where you can store the window order under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 current. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Renders icon in the toolbar, or select the Rendering menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert as many render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the Deflsettings icon in the toolbar or in the View menu View menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but it makes sense, but a name that lets you see the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the box size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you only want to render a small area of the image, select the crop section subsection and enter the image section to render in the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In combination field quality you can select the properties that & Povray; used to render. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual of & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, different errors can occur. these images often have a moiré pattern or step effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details will not be displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the representation. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you turn on anti-aliasing, calculate and connect & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. the default is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because the super-sampling refers to the neighbouring pixels. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive, because each pixel is continuously divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated color values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method POV-Ray tracks a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixel is split into 4 sub-pixels, which are pursued individually and are checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last adjustment for the quality of renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; which calculates diffuse light reflection. it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this card you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent when the corresponding rays hit no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly terminated, you can find the reason for this here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray, select the Import menu item... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the full command range of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source code in & kpovmodeler; import, write this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRwBegin and / / * PMRwEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this inserts the source code of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects into the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it to the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source code for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called when & kpovmodeler; a scene renders. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation to the displayed object. set the path to your document and version here. supported are versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (for example, height-field data) in the paths to the & Povray; Libraries. if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene, you must also add the path to these files here. if a file occurs in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The color for the wire models. the second color is used for displaying selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used to display the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type identifiers.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object capture of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wireframe views. here you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and rotations.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the sphere, you can set the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you check High details for extended projections, all wire model views are further subdivided if the camera uses an extended projection. advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from perspective and vertical projections. this property results in better approximation for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">When displaying a wall, a wall is rendered behind the objects. the wall is represented in a chess board pattern in two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1069">When you tick the ground, a floor below the objects is rendered. the floor is represented in a checkerboard pattern in two adjustable colours.</seg>
<seg id="1070">If you tick the edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. you can set the values for depth and threshold value. more exact information on the parameters can be found in the Render-modes section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window instructions section explains how to create and store window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">Drop down selector Panel: displays all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the selected window order when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The List Existing Window System displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and deleting a selected arrangement with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Each window order is identified by the name. the name must be clear and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all the views for the selected window order. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">The position of the new window. with New column, you create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten you anchor the window under the existing window, with tab card you will get a flashcard view together with the previous view and floating does not anchor the view in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you just have & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of the two programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before complaining that you only get a black screen as a result. if you use a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied for rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene is in the dark and you will get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed all error-free, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following default window order:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols frequently, so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first have to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select Delete from the menu item. you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the scene view from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera. if you click on it, you will see the content of the view object properties in which you will find the different parameters of the camera. see the user documentation about & Povray; see further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Do not change the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the camera's target point. just click on a control point with the left mouse button and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">Pressing the Apply button or the Enter key will change the wireframe views and the object tree immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the camera's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the floor for the scene. you could, for example, insert a header (insert final body quivers) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method to solve this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler way. you can use an infinite plane as floor:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the level in the object tree, change the name and then press the Apply button or the Enter key. the new name will be displayed in the object tree immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the plane, albeit at the moment just as a finite level. if you render the scene, the plane extends up to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If you look at the object tree carefully, you will find that you can fold the entry for the floor by clicking on the + in front of the object. in this case, you will find only the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shift. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the property properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the floor to the exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and adjust the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the floor to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but select something simple at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases, a dialog opens, in which you can choose how the object is to be inserted. the pigment is then displayed in the object tree. you can change the name in the property view (name = ground-pigment), with a click on the preview button you can see how the pigment looks now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment is just a matte black material because you have to re-enter settings for the pigment. always remember that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the header and bullet in the preview window, just click on the Apply button and then enter the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you render your image now by clicking on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">In the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the Item Tree you have to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can do this more often, but the chessboard color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome and change the colors in the view of the property properties:</seg>
<seg id="1102">You should be able to do this step by simply because you should have understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can just be created just as easily as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of the object properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (Don't forget to press the input button or the user button), so the ball has contact with the ground. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course, rendering now gives a strange result: as you can see before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the following step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as on the ground, give the sphere a pigment as color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select the first object and change the name for example in sphere of pigment. click on the sphere pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings gloss effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromium-plated surfaces, even when metallic: not even selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options you & kpovmodelling; offers. hopefully you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracytracing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a 3D scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">If you raytracen a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the perspective of the viewer (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) through each pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected and broken by the objects, the visual effects of the light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you won't see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene. without a light source you don't see anything, the picture is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog, you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog, you can select a file that you created previously with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this sub-menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a storage space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage will be discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry can only be selected if you have not saved saved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last command you wish to revert. this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit Undo.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Saves the current window order and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new order or overwrite an existing order.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeler; here you can change the look, shortcut and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog for modifying the keyboard shortcut. you can modify or add new commands to & kpovmodeler with this option; modify or add new commands.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. with this option you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces without having to model any diffraction on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for both a dump map and a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are generated from dozens or even hundreds of these basic elements. these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic look.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color card.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the image size or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kufic show; it is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can display with Click the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can set whether each image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are looking for a specific file, just type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the lower right corner. if a matching file name has been found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set existing multimedia keys to work as & Amarok; short commands work, making your keyboard to & Amarok; Control center.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many common functions, most of which can be found in other KDE applications. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP features of collection, context browsers, players, playlist, playlists browser and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some of its own command line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user a feedback if the script can't be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script if all required modules are present and use kDialog so that the user knows why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Add require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Corundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kDialog --sorry' # {error} 'exit</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder, you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply extend them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">With the help of DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow executing external programs and commands. for this purpose, the exec () function is usually used. in this way dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends messages to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events if there is no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure The script to show the setup dialog. to save and load the setup data, each script must take care of itself. if a script is started, Amarok converts the working folder to the folder where all data should be stored.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange signalizes that a new piece is being played. the script could now & zb; with DCOP functions, queries can be retrieved with more information about the new track (such as the metadata or the piece length).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newVolume signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMinuClicked: submenu itemTitle paths Contains the path to the selected files of the playlist, if a custom menu item can be identified. to add a custom entry to the menu, you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle) to remove an entry.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed, for example to do cleaning operations. this includes, for example, saving of data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2).</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the catabolization amarokscript. for this reason, you should rename your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can hang it on www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the Wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; script.</seg>
<seg id="1200">& Amarok; is an audio player for & kde;. & Amarok; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1201">With & Amarok; you can simply drag music to the playlist, rather than having to go through endless menus. you may also search for a very specific title from thousands in your collection. with & Amarok; 's Collecting Browser and Quick Search, you will find the piece within seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Maybe you already have a few playlists, but can you never decide what you want to listen to? then the playlist browser is the right thing for you. and if the decision is still difficult, the dynamic mode and smart playlists automatically choose the right music according to certain criteria.</seg>

<seg id="1204">Usually, you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amarok sources to compile and install Amarok:</seg>
<seg id="1205">Da & Amarok; autoconf and automake are used, you should have no trouble with compiling. if you encounter any problems, please report them to the & kde; mailing lists.</seg>
<seg id="1206">& Amarok; like most applications, has some options you can enable or disable at compile time using the configure script. this is a list of available options.</seg>

<seg id="1218">Keeping up-to-date piece when changing the piece causes the playlist to roll up / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window area.</seg>
<seg id="1219">Switching to the context browser automatically indicates the context browser as soon as the next piece is played.</seg>
<seg id="1220">In the Appearance section, you can adjust & Amarok; s Appearance. the section is divided into three parts.</seg>
<seg id="1221">In the Fonts section, you can set the use of different fonts in & Amarok; use the otherwise grayed section by selecting your own fonts. you can select fonts for the following area: playlist window, player window and context browser. press Select..., so you can select a font from the selection dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1222">With the Custom color scheme, you have the choice of choice and can set up your own color scheme. to do so, use the color selector enabled for foreground and background color.</seg>
<seg id="1223">Resume playback when starting, that & Amarok; after the program start, the play will automatically continue with the piece at the place with which it has been stopped at the last stop.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Setting up the On-Screen display allows you to switch on the OSD. when on-screen display is checked, a preview of the OSD is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview directly.</seg>
<seg id="1225">The first option is the font. click Select... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OSD. the check box shade causes the text to be shaded in the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1226">Using your own colors gives you the option to customize the OSD colors for font and background. clicking on the color surfaces will open the color selection dialog. if your own colors are not enabled, the default colors will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1227">The Display Text entry field displays the text displayed in the OSD. by entering placeholders the OSD can be adapted to your needs. below you will find a list of available placeholders and what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="1228">The screen option is intended for Xinerama users. this allows you to specify the screen of a multiple monitor environment to appear on the OSD.</seg>
<seg id="1229">The audio output card card lets you select an audio driver from the drop-down box. some drivers still activate additional settings in this card board.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The card collection is used to set up all the settings for your collection, including the folder and the type of database for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1231">Here you can select the folders that & Amarok; search for music files. to include a folder in the collection, select the check box next to its name. this section also contains check boxes to set how to proceed with the selected folders.</seg>
<seg id="1232">Browse subfolders recursively: this causes that & Amarok; both the crossed and their subfolders will search for music.</seg>
<seg id="1233">Monitor changes: allows & Amarok; to monitor the selected folders on changes (e.g. if music files are added or deleted). additionally, an incremental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection.</seg>
<seg id="1234">Import Playlists: causes & Amarok to add all found playlists to your collection folders (.pls- and .m3u files) to your collection, and the automatically added playlists will appear later in the playlists browser.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The part collection database is used to select a database for the collection. the combination field driver: lets you choose between SQLite or MySql. if MySql is selected, further setup is required in the MySql subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="1236">The MySql setup section is used to set up the database for & Amarok; under calculator: enter the host on which the MySql database is located. then you enter the network port in which the database is accessible. name: is the database name to which the connection is established.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Use username: and password: to enter the data needed for connection to the database.</seg>
<seg id="1238">The debit card last.fm provides support for last.fm. & Amarok; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last.fm server and create music recommendations for the current part if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1239">Enter your username and password for your Last.fm profile. if you do not have a profile, you can register one on the last.fm website.</seg>
<seg id="1240">Send played pieces and update the profile: this setting allows & Amarok to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last.fm profile.</seg>
<seg id="1241">Call similar performers: after activating this setting & Amarok; get a list of similar interpreters to the played piece. you can see the list in the context browser. note: you don't need a last.fm profile to use this feature.</seg>
<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & b; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the kdelibs package and otherwise no other KDE packages. you need to have kdelibs installed (including the programs it contains, because & Amarok; requires some of them, e.g. modules or scripts).</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some features such as OSD require your window manager to keep the relevant standards of freedesktop.org. so Gnome will work, but fluxbox will cause problems, for example. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">You can locate the file by hiding in ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log. please report this error to the Taglib developers under bugs.kde.org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash.</seg>
<seg id="1246">Most of the time, it is because Taglib crashes when reading the meta-information from this file. please report this error to the Taglib developers at bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database then try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if, for example, & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib has been compiled with GCC 3.3.X, this will crash when processing meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then turn off automatically when inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail automatically opens with a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be fixed.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 in the meta-information, but do not mark them as Unicode. the following perl script fixes the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1252">#! / usr / bin / perl the "File $ARGV [0]; use MP3:: Mplib; my $v2tag = $mp3 &gt; get _ v2tag; print" Error when writing the tags of $ARGV [0]\ "unless $mp3 &gt; set _ v2tag ($v2tag, amp; UTF8);</seg>

<seg id="1255">If you get this mistake: amarokapp: symbol lookup error: amarokapp: undefined symbol: _ ZN11KSystemTray9setPixmapERK7QPixmap, then please check if Amarok uses the correct Qt library. this can be seen with ldd'which amarokapp '_ BAR _ grep qt.</seg>
<seg id="1256">To fix this bug, you may need to remove any conflicting Qt version, or / etc / ld.so.conf so that Amarok will find the correct version first.</seg>
<seg id="1257">Most installation problems are solved most easily by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution. you can also search for help from other users or the developers. use the forum and IRC at irc.freenode.net in the channel # Amarok.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Bugzilla is not suitable for searching for help. please only make a mistake there if you have something to fix a bug in Amarok itself.</seg>
<seg id="1259">After the start of & Amarok; only an empty playlist appears. how do music pieces come into there?</seg>
<seg id="1260">This is simple. use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want. then drag the files to the right part of the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you use the GStreamer driver with the Alsa sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to simultaneously output audio. this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or through the dmix module for Alsa (software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you find the cause and solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify another sink (e.g., sink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">This does & Amarok; already. don't forget that media must first be decoded. you can't just listen to mp3.

<seg id="1334">This chapter explains how all the functions of & Amarok; used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The Player Window is your one-click & Amarok; control center. at the top of the window there is a running text display showing the currently running track or current stream. directly below it is the area, the playing time, bit rate and sample rate of the current play. a click on this area changes the display of the already expired playing time to the remaining play time of the play.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the Player Window includes a selection of audio analyzers, including the running text display. you can switch by the available analyzer by clicking the left mouse button on the area.</seg>

<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play-position slider. use the sliders to adjust the play position or volume. with the playback buttons you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">Using the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own presets.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the equalizer, use Tools Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>

<seg id="1343">The playlist window can be divided into two main areas, the left side is the navigation. in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist, such as the context browser. the playlist is easy to use and yet even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context browser displays various information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be customized with the help of context browser designs. the context browser contains three subwindows: music, Text and Interpret. these three subwindows will be explained in detail later.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you may notice that the bottom window is gone. the information displayed there are now distributed in other parts of & Amarok; in addition, the information can be collected in the statistics window (optional statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music below shows information about the currently running piece, as well as the artist and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this subwindow displays information about the piece. in the title is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you can see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to look up the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">Under the MusicBrainz symbol you will find more information about the current play. you can see here how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">In order to display cover images in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current one. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png will be supported. the context browser will also display cover images that were either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next area, Recommended pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will be played immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "among the" "" "Recommended" "" "pieces there are the favorite pieces of this interpreter. this section shows the five most rated pieces of the current interpreter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. to do so, right-click anywhere in the subwindow and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the artist, lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be up and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click on all the pieces in the single areas to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">This feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other web pages using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the Internet. if no text script is still running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button will allow you to edit the lyrics. the modified version will then be stored in & Amarok; s collection database, and no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Find button opens a search on google.com after the lyrics for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Grouping Interpret - only groups the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the performer. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Artist / Album - First of all the pieces are arranged according to the artist, including another distribution according to the respective album. if you want to see compilations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are shown at the beginning of the list under Various Interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Grouping Artist / Year - Album - Sort by Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (the newest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name will be used.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabetically by each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping Genre and Interpret - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by artist.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping Genre / Interpret / Album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the artist.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons you can customize and combine the grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically re-collect your collection once you change something on the selected folders. if you have many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">There is a search filter directly below the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. references to the use of this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Under the search filter there is a selection box with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can choose from different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours to a year. furthermore, you can of course also select your complete collection so that the filter will be switched off practically.</seg>
<seg id="1368">Clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser gives you the following options.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This will empty the current playlist and insert the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to Playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist. by double-clicking on one entry, you will reach the same effect.</seg>

<seg id="1378">Highlighting the compilation-mark - Changes a compilation of selected album back to a normal album. afterwards the album will no longer be displayed under different performers but again under the corresponding artist.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser simplifies the handling of many playlists. among other things, it also includes smart playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlist is smart playlists. these use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists at runtime. smart playlists consist of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click Add Smart Playlist to open the dialog for creating a new smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player subwindow is used for the connection of & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; for example, before starting & Amarok; when & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod according to artist sorted in the top list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer pieces to your iPod, drag the desired tracks from the playlist and drop them to the list performer. if you are done, click Apply. so the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is complete, quit & Amarok; and release the disk integration for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The search is useful in folders with very many files, because in the file list all files will be hidden which do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">For example tar: / home / mike / musik.tar.gz enter and press enter key, you can access music in the music .tar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist becomes longer than in the window, it can be difficult to attach files by simple drop-down. in this case, holding down the shift key can be helpful: this will automatically include dropped files at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play. you can change the order by simply drag and drop the entries with the mouse to the desired location. once you type letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter separate search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries containing all search terms. for example, if you enter a two three, search will find all entries containing one, two and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR enter between the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. example: one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof) will be found.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries containing spaces, then close the search term with goose feet: Mike Oldfield. this will be searched for entries that include Mike Oldfield, but not after entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a particular search column, you can also search for larger or smaller ones. for example: rating: &gt; 50. this searches for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something searches for pieces that do not contain something.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variants as you like. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 comment: bathroom. this searches for all pieces that include either Mike Oldfield, or a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bad.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can set the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then right-click on the entries in the desired order. the entries then get a label with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar's toolbar can be found at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some features of the playlist. to the left, you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist. to the right, you will find playlist, empty and Random playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore. this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>

<seg id="1400">There are many more available buttons for the toolbar, for example, playback controls and volume controls. you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool tracks.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it displays the title of the current play, the number of pieces and the total playtime of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieving, a slider for the playback position and the playing time of the current play is displayed.</seg>

<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or Video-DVD project. it causes & k3b to import files from a previous session into the current project. this is useful if you have files for a multi-session CD. the data from the previous session are always included, even if this function is not used. it is intended for you rather than help, so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This feature only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a CD, which you can then write later on. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This allows you to copy a DVD to another medium even without a project file. alternatively, you can also create an image of a DVD, which you can later burn later. besides, it is also possible to convert a DVD with the help of the copying dialog, so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in its original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW, so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog to format a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), which will completely erase the content. & k3b; lets you choose between writing modes overwriting and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Burn a previously created CD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source, which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button. (neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog asks you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be fired immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously utilised DVD video can be converted. this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents, but can also be used anywhere. it contains information about the read video, encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">This information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium, such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Shows a list of the tool bars of & k3b; if an entry is ticked, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is ticked, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not checked, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives. if the table view is enabled, their contents will be displayed in the table of contents. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejection of the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The table of contents allows you to select and drag files to the project view. the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs if a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD has been selected in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The header bar is a narrow area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the header has no real function, it only looks nice and clearly separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This will open a dialog box to change the key assignments for & k3b; after you have selected one of the available commands in the top part, you can adjust the key allocation for that further down.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This starts the k3b; Setup Wizard. this allows you to set the correct permissions for burning CDs and DVDs. to do this, system administrator rights are required, so you have to enter the password for the system administrator (root) at the start of the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, as many others & kde; applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface parts of the functionality can be controlled, for example, via a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the & DCOP, you can use either the dcop command line program or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical to the range of functions, so your taste and the type of your task are crucial to which of the programs you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter, we assume that you use the dcop command line program. to use the & DCOP features, you must first make sure that & k3b; then type something like the following on the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">Besides the general & DCOP; functions that all & kde; program have in common, support & k3b; mainly two other parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface from & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, formatted DVD and more functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoCD Project () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () void debudf () void burnCdImage () void burnCdImage (KURL url) void burnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can obtain a project via the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then obtain a reference to the project using # dcop k3b K3blink currentProject By using this reference it is possible to change the project via K3bProjectInterface.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the K3bProjectInterface and the powerful K3bProjectInterface, which can only be used on data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name, QString parent) void addurl (KURL url, QString) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString NewName) void setVolumeID (QString path)</seg>
<seg id="1492">This makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createable / home / trueg / somefile.txt / foo / bar</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudiocreator; is an audio CD; audio CD; it can easily be read and stored in MP3 or OGG files. other formats are possible, depending on the encoder that is installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudiocreator; is the interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in WAV files on hard disk) and by many encoders that encode these WAV files. currently lame for MP3, ogga for Oggs and FLAC (lossless compression) are supported by default (These encoders may still be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the tracks of the & CD; read out and stored in WAV files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step, these WAV files (usually one per caption) are compressed into the MP3- or OGG format or in other formats like lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD, is used by & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, it has to be done right now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step, lame (for MP3), oggpreto (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually installed for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything by yourself. however, only the encoders need to be installed. if, for example, FLAC is not used, its installation is also not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format should be used? the chapter Which encoding / file format gives a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudiocreator; cdparanoia to read out the audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to handle any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device handle the protection, it is not possible to avoid any copy protection mechanisms; just avoid purchasing copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only once (the setup dialog can be called so often until a suitable configuration has been found), the daily handling of reading a & CD is explained afterwards. this will (hopefully) help understand the lean approach of the user interface that you frequently stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Can convert into many formats - depending on which encoders are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; get information from the freedb from the internet or can work completely without network, with everything being recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the main window commands. on the step by step example, you will find more information about how this program is used and screenshots with descriptions of the tabs for the configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">The CDDB requests the CD data according to the setup of request on the CDDB tab. (this can be local or online, in the latter case the connection to the Internet must first be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Start reading and - if an encoder configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup Guide - encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so that the selection can be read as the default with a different encoder. it should be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the Setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the file manager so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a full & CD; read and code.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notifications (such as protocols, pipses) for program events (such as read the & CD; quit).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the Main Setup dialog from & kaudiocreator; with different flashcards (such as Encoder, for setting up the Encoder). here you have to go before the program can be used successfully!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC there are others such as' shorts' or 'monkey' that may be available for this distribution. the drawbacks are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">Among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model, MP3 and OGG are the most common. OGG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but over this bit rate the differences are less important as both encoders produce very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'Not so 'free, lame is shipped with most distributions for free, but there are open licenses questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ High to very high sound quality (at high bitrates), but compared to OGG slightly deeper quality with lower bitrates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG playback devices is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - when music is to be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD player, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard disk) or special auto stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices usually only support MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide for most people and most music pieces acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset Extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex pieces of music and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset Extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h' = 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a song. good enough for music of teenagers, portable devices and car equipment. but not good enough for better stereo hi-fi systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you don't want to have absolutely top quality without regard to file size, then choose this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or fetched automatically from the freedb via the Internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can transfer / use & kaudiocreator; and create the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example, to add the title to the keyword (English: tag) when encoding MP3s with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; added. the result looks like: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that provide information to download / enter, so that all the others can download this information instead of entering the machine itself. it is to be noted that here only is spoken by text: & CD; Title, Artist, Name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is no more or less valuable, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudiocreator; is actively a check box to select (sending an address). for the use of freedb may be used with another (counterfeit) address other than the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems, the email address is not used when retrieving data from the server (but this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically the next underlying mirror server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org gives a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually monthly generated) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to save in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumors that it will be used cdparanoia; those who want to know more exactly, seek in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; s. to note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the right distribution if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read WAV files, the encoder and the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the encoding tab. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code reader package must be installed from the Linux distribution concerned before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined encoders. more information about encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, you can obtain further information about its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; Console).</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the read and write real on it and whether both cdparanoia as well as the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, this can give you tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you'll get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. for example, a suitable package for lame can be found using a search engine because it is considered not to be completely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you own write permission (eg; by trying to copy something into it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & kaudiocreator;, something which is probably only done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what must be repeated for each CD;</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the encoders to be used for compression of the music (lame) as well as the audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting audio quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps).</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them at each reading of a & CD; change if the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is transferred to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, then a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device designations for CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives.</seg>
<seg id="1553">Here is not much to do. here an additional transformation can be defined. in our example, everything is as left / inserted as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only in case of incomplete information please select, so that you will be informed if there is a lack of information on creating keywords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1555">The card board CD; -Settings. simply select both entries. we are comfortable and let the & CD; data automatically download via the Internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down box is easier, will be a & CD; this is associated with low risk, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the directory names / filenames or tag entries, you can easily change. the directory or file name will be changed with Konqueror- &gt; and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">You can work with freedb locally in offline mode if you download the database before. however, this is over 620 MB, consider this twice if this is worthwhile. in order to use freedb in offline mode, the two selection fields have to be selected, at least the first. the mode is set on the following card board.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from freedb server over the Internet. how do the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror-server near you. on this path the load is distributed among the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work at the same time as the server is concerned, as many firewalls boggle the protocol 8880 by default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, because the protocol is usually open to surf the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want to send any data to the freedb server. deactivating the first check box should suffice.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screenshot. (make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously leaking pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know, therefore simply try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this to check out the CD; at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this, the path / folder can be specified in which the wav files are stored. this can be useful if there is only space on another drive. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. don't forget this folder if you want to do something with the WAV files yourself.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Just enter it as it is on the screenshot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something has to be flipped to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset Extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good hi-fi stereo systems. the resulting bitrate is average about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory usage.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the generation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted if necessary. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tag for & kde; in case of a later change in the tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the full path) and the output file (including the full path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as shown in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneous encoded wav files: with a dual core or quadcore or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="1573">This is it, we have just finished the basic setup of & kaudiovisual; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a CD; if you have wisely chosen the organizational structure of your music, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">This section describes how the process of reading the & CD; the folder structure, the way the music is organized on the hard disk, has been described and set up in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is structured, as we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb is described.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD which is not yet included in freedb, the screenshots look slightly different than those for a CD; with successful data collected by freedb. therefore, you will learn the & CD; manually enter data instead of extracting them from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Don't try the CD; this example can be found. it's a 'special' output of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this is not done yet, then the & CD must be inserted in the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window, as in the screenshot. this only if the CD; as an audio CD; could be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this is not done, look for the Help section in the FAQ section or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the CD has been successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; -key for your & CD; there will be a window, and you can select the database entry that best suits your & CD; fits.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for automatic query from freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for settings), you can also trigger this manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you do not have a local database, but get the data from the Internet, you will need to connect to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD-Editor - Input of the CD-data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first line of the input field 'Current Title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field 'Current title' unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The comment field of the album can be used for the individual comments, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that are valid for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the following screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words with capital letters begin or not...), but also to check if there are any undesired remarks.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece, and only 28 characters for the comment field. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio.DLL; this option is set on the encoding settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also recreate ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders or file formats. see the help of the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that obviously coincides with the style of the tapering CD; in this example, this is not important as we do not provide the CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are to be found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. simply click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data we have collected for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current item.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD;</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button on the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are shown above the BOM.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that there is a check-in before each line of a piece. only the titles that are selected are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or off. make sure that all pieces are selected, or press the All Parts button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">If you click on the Selection button to read the selection process, this window appears for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what's going on.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab orders to switch to the order window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the jobs. the first piece is currently readout to the hard drive. the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message when you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully encoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and destination folders are not what we have entered here in the example. did you check if you have write access to the temporary files folder and destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred directly after reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Assignment 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and coding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found any configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems to be configurable is the number of parallel processes to read and code. the used computer with an AMD64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and encoding (of however, two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last song is read while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoder. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message will be displayed for a short time in the top left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudiocreator, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to generate compressed audio files such as MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>

<seg id="1609">This section is aimed at people compiled from source files, not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is correct for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls up many different programs has many variants of settings. best read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it displays screenshots of the different card tabs of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still reading? even if only the help menu was clicked after starting the program, without any clue as it should continue from this empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program start), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who is reading this, probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is the first version for a manual to & kaudiocreator; thought. whoever wants to add or change anything useful may do it. at least only after contacting the author. and if you read this, he left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and karaoke player from & kde; besides others, it features real-time graphics and karaoke-real-time highlighting of texts also some features that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kde; & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound Project driver that is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying color, making it easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag and drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from a & konqueror; window to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports the two existing standards to save text to MIDI files (song events or text events). kmid automatically determines the procedure used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you finish & kde while playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external midi synthesizer, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; window to the & kmid; window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the play button in the toolbar, select the play button from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece starts automatically as soon as you drag it onto the & kmid; (for several pieces, they are added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and go back and forth with the knob.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slow, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo ad and adjust the playback speed. to get back the original tempo, double click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure acts on the space bar like a print on the pause button or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item, thus interrupts playback. press the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in one piece of music. some pieces use texture, others use lyrics and others both. some pieces have no text at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better: the event type is automatically detected, which a song is used, so you do not have to manually adjust the pop-up menu. if you select the Auto Text option in the Settings menu, the karaoke text will be automatically selected, but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other type.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to specify an event type, select the text events and / or song events from the Settings menu. the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played back in series. in this section, you will find how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu item under the item Organization.... Click on New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking Copy and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs as the original one at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can select the desired one in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you don't want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection is not saved. remember this when you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, you have to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add button. in turn, the file dialog will appear, with which help you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Add to Collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic add-on to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or drag & drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to collection is not enabled, the temporary collection is activated and emptied when a piece is opened. this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you must open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs will be played. if you select the sequence from the submenu sequence of the menu items, the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">When you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it in the collection manager, or use the drop-down list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select Next Song, the next song next to the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To return a song vice versa, select the Preview piece, the previous item from the menu item or press the arrow left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to delete and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter because it is not stored when leaving & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not General MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events which the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change Patch to Bright Piano in events of the type Change Patch to Trumpet and thus always lets a trumpet sound when you originally have to play a piano.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have only one sound card, you do not need a MIDI map, because all sound cards are GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file manually (with your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the required settings for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may only appear once, except the Keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, each occurrence is a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define Keymap "Name of keymap..." END Define Keymap "Another keymap... END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is used to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as e-mail so that I can provide support in future versions of & kmid; support for devices that are not General MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In this section you will see how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order or omit any row for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all sounds that need this instrument to sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127, it takes patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, no matter what sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that this is meant by the term drum patch of the patch where each sound represents another percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc.) and not the one where the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have it).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The Keymap section is used to specify how sound can be mapped to a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP range, the order of the rows is very important, as is their presence.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are mainly used to map tones on the percussions channel. take a look as an example of the provided key maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP segment.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI to Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP segment has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel that is mapped to the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keyword will be defined with the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will attempt to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x is used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussions channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard that receives a pitch Bender Event is to play a pitch higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. this can be found in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you can see which sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button does not illuminate green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the Settings menu, select View Channel View: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">You can change the pace of a song. so if you find, for example, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file containing information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. this allows the same MIDI file to perform very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs around 50 KB, while a mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) from & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I would like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I do not want to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Accept, therefore, support & kmid; drag and drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to the & kmid; window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">First, enable setting Automatic Add to Collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the default tempo you can double click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -Desktop with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (when I play a MIDI file) or attached (if I want to play a MIDI file) or if I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; change the window and drag the desired file to the window of & kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you only want to listen to a file quickly, without adding it to a collection, switch off the Auto add setting to the collection, and the new; file will be added to the temporary collection. opening Files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Suppose you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.V. and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the Auto add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play also B.Smid and C.mid and create a collection with all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! if I listen to these songs or see the postcard, this will encourage me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.larrosa.Jimenez; from Maacute; laga (Spain). I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; laga. at the moment I'm not much free time for my hobbies, but I try to take some time.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you want to know where to download MIDI / karaoke files, if you have a question, a bug or an idea for an extension of & kmid, or even if you want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a MIDI- / karaoke file from a local group. if you want to send me a postcard or a MIDI file, I will list (if you want). before sending a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I've written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and didn't get money from anybody for it. I would like to emphasize that I just keep programming because / when I get feedback from users (postcards or emails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch at AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also apply Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing the AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Ola Sigurdson, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, error correction or even a supporting email.</seg>

<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can also be found on his homepage, which is located under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and look at images. you can also find links to pages with other karaoke songs, & etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer, as the sound quality depends on your sound card. it is not the same whether you use a FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you don't have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL. it then runs as if you have a sound card, except that you can of course not listen to music.</seg>

<seg id="1706">& KMPlayer; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files supported by MPlayer or Phonon supported formats, as well as for playback of DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>

<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called anddoable windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally, there is a window with the playlist. and finally, there is an information window that is displayed only when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the Bookmarks menu, but these are single entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level. if you click on an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current piece ', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing XML configuration files. of course you can only do this if & SMB; not running. the various files in the ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / apps can be changed by an editor, but also by the application itself. to do so simply click on a name of a category, then select the XML content of this part.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, the Edit menu has to be selected with Playlist and either select Edit mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes are lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without comparing it with the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">Due to the ease of the author of & KMPlayer; some functions can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation during startup and ending can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc and altering [General Options] No Intro = 0 obyte option on '1'. if the option is not present, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to enable another animation. & SMB; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / KMPlayer / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. this would be disturbing at the end-animation though, the user can therefore finish the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start-animation can be the display of your favorite photos: & lt; & lt; & lt; img dur = "inverse" src = "file: / / / home / Koos / mum.gif" fit = "meet" / lt; & lt; & smile.In the source package of & KMPlayer; are in the list testing / some examples of SMIL that are supported by & KMPlayer.</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; here, the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream can be set from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for debugging is the button 'Console' in the toolbar of KMPlayer. here is the output of mplayer visibly.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog by & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerc, like setting the backend by mimetype. here is an example of how a flash is playing with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played within & SMB; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the & KMPlayer to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & KMPlayer module needs to be specified as a service provider for the mime type application / x-shockwave-flash in the setup dialog file assignments of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & KMPlayer; is to be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library. if there are no errors, the backend output is within & KMPlayer; (View, Console, or Console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">In order to always have a given backend for a specific mime type (of course only if this is also determined), this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, phonon should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SMB; can play from TV cards, either using MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be watched, the device to be used and the TV channels need to be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">For configuring the VDR (video data recorder) settings in the KMPlayer, the dialog in Settings under - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. there should be detected ports, of which one is selected. the correct name probably has a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since the VDR support of KMPlayer can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works). this is also supported only on the first screen (: 0.0). for this reason, the videoforlinux extension for the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">Internally, KMPlayer uses different names for the sources. at the time of the creation of this documentation, these are dvdnaval, dvdsource, exitsource, introsource, pipesource, tvscanners, TVSource, urlsource, vcdsource and vdrsource. if enabled, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there hints how I can quieter my CDROM drive when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the command HDPARM -E 8 / dev / cdrom is a user root after mounting the device. it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / cdrom drives to the CDROM drive.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Xine starts only slowly, why does each time my CPU have to be tested for performance?</seg>

<seg id="1751">While here only a good overview of & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book for it. to be able to rule properly, good books such as H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999 can be used.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction includes at least the command\\ documentclass, the body starts with the command\\ begin {document} and has to be closed with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick Installation Wizard of & Kile; is a useful tool for quick creation of a document in & Kile; selecting the wizard provides some options for the creation of the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Documentary classes: this describes the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], letter [letter], report [report], article (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrtext], projector [scrbook], projector [Prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: this sets the character encoding. it should use the code encoding of the system. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best, UTF-8X should be selected (for the correct processing of the & latex; -documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for & latex; for the integration they only have to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (for compliance with German DIN regulations). you should always find use when creating German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users do not have to worry about this. it is just a short description of the functions and further information on this is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; provides - just like other source code editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the inappropriate ones). by & Kile, a simple problem search will be possible (example): if you want to see more areas of a large text on the screen, it is very probable that some mathematical environment is not closed. however, you will save it by highlighting time and time debugging.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environment, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & Kile; automatically generates an empty line (for entering the text) and the associated line to the lieutenant of the command (e.g.\\ Complete}). this function can be set in the menu Setting; setup... LaTeX commands will be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are usually subdivided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to the following elements (part is the highest and neither the least the lowest element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful for searching. once a DVI; file [dependent D e V ice I nap File]]] was created, & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source code.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the available output types from & tex; or & latex; there are many tools for viewing, conversion and printing of DVI; -files for different systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the context search, the elements of the DVI; file are connected with the editor and as soon as one element is clicked in the DVI; file, the corresponding section in the & latex; source code is jumped to the corresponding section in the & latex; source code is applied to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work is simplified with others .tex files. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be set about project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Fast construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no source code errors).</seg>
<seg id="1768">File surveillance: in this mode, the DVI; file will be carried out in this mode, and it will not be called & eyepiece, after the rapid construction.</seg>
<seg id="1769">When looking at the Edit toolbar, the three large selection fields should be noticed. the selection boxes were designed for fast insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down box is for quick classification of the document into parts, chapters, sections...</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection box Further is for inserting articles such as keywords, notes or references. the available possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command a name for a section, a picture or another element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: used for reference to a specified term (choose a selection field).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. the author has good experiences with & kbibtex; and & kbib;. the & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box named GrÃ ¶ vest is used for defining the font size. you can set the fonts for the main text, notes, etc. there are the following fonts:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the type of document and closing the settings. 2. the document can be written by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The parentheses after the command\\ documentclass contain the settings for the command. the setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font size is not specified at the beginning, this can also be done later in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above code example has been entered, the & latex; source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the building or the quick-construction button.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be searched for errors in logging. when using rapid construction & eyepiece, it should be started automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns shall have a different font. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} will allow the modification of the font sizes inside the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are considered only within the environment (from\\ begin) to\\ end {environment}). there is no reduction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to ease the readability and usability of the document. for example, you can add certain fonts, bold print, italics, submissions, etc. these commands can end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is for the italics pressure and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or another environment. a single word in a sentence can be displayed italic with\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quote: creates a quote in the document. the quote begins with\\ begin {quote} and ends with\\ end {quote}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background to writing the source text with the & latex; markup language was presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">As soon as a bit of text was entered in the wizard, there should be some adjustments for the better readability of the document. therefore, at least one quote, a few spots in fat and italics pressure and a poem may come to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, the editor view or Ctrl E can be converted back to the editor (in the internal viewer).</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI; file is created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. simply try and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I ndependent). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for the readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converters or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For the printing of a & DVI; file are the same steps as for creating the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI - then the document can be printed out using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The tool bar allows the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. as soon as the DVI; file is made of the & latex; source code, the conversion can begin in desired other formats using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The preview search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI; file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a corresponding setting for all & latex; binaries. for this purpose only Modern may be set up under Settings Kile... Tools building must be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">To execute the preview search, the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then clicked on forward search. the jump to the corresponding position in the DVI; viewer takes place then.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece, with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; -document the corresponding & latex; -Document of & Kile; open and jump to the corresponding line. for this & Kile; in & Eyepiece; Set as text editor (Setting up the eyepiece... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If you do not want to open the & DVI, you may have an error. if an error is present, it will be shown in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file declares the source of errors in the source text. in the editor you can then use the LaTeX errors and nests LaTeX errors for jumps between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the incorrect line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the erroneous line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window appears to select the template you want to use for the document. the default options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting an empty document, a document can either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Frequent users of & latex; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or a new file must be created. & Kile; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document... create.</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template by File New, some strings may be replaced with other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set in Settings Kile... Settings can be set.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template it is necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is substituted by entering document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {items}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created this way, the following steps must be executed:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. an easy way to create a template should be searched for on the Internet and the steps described below should be searched.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& kile; used & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting of many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;). many settings for & kate; can be made in the menu tools directly out & kile; out.</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn the manual to Kate should be consulted. users of & Kile; can start there directly with reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very convenient & latex; command reference which can be called via the LaTeX reference menu. it contains almost all commands that can be found in & latex; use and its syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-clicking with the Ctrl key to select the & tex; word means that the\\ par\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\ par.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with pressed left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source text can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to search the most different types of source texts and highlight these. for example, the & latex; -commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many wizard can add additional hocks. this is an own type of bookmark within the text. the menu entries Edit Ficks or the corresponding keyboard shortcuts allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. this also emphasizes the jump mark, so that it is automatically deleted when entering a character.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as & Kile; although & kate; already offers excellent possibilities, have been added to & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source text added; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain a blank line on both sides). this extended meaning does not include tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. this extended meaning includes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also closes & latex; -Commands with a back panel (\\) and an additional star (*) will be selected at the end.</seg>
<seg id="1819">For the deletion of a part of the document it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; provides the keyboard shortcut Ctrl; K with which the whole line is removed. & Kile; provides with its own commands for a faster possibility.</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit output paragraph.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been made clear that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for additional commands under Edit environment for a possible simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command jumped to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">This command jumped to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current location is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to hide the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is in front of or within the\\ begin {vicinity} command, skip to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overview below can be quickly lost. this command buckles the recently opened environment, so that the nested environment structure is not broken.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups which are determined by clamps {...}. under Edit TeX group are a few important commands that match those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command jumped to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">This command jumped to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the pin buckle.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor happens before or behind the curly clamp of a & tex; -group #, the other end of the group is sprayed (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups parentheses may be lost easily. this command buckles the last group, so that the nested structure of the & tex; groups will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple application signs are used as manors. for the practical implementation it is used in & Kile; the sign "is used for two simple application signs. & Kile; knows this case and supports two closing arguments for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic entry of the double trigger character can be set up under Settings Kile... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used in all languages (e.g., german or french) and thus German or French reference marks. many other languages can also be available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When using Shift. enter & Kile; an intelligent line breaks. if the current position is within a Listen environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not only a line breaks but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Within a table environment, close & Kile; the current line with\\\\ with a closing line breaks down.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support preset & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set under Settings Kile; Setting up... LaTeX added.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange columns in tables environments and thus all Et characters (amp;) among each other. & Kile; attempts to enable this. while pressing Shift; Alt; amp; looks & Kile; after the next tab in the underlying line. although this tab is not the associated tab, add & Kile; some spaces for the columns position of the current tabulator.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already provides a good source code completion, it has been expanded in & Kile; to include special commands (mostly for & latex;). three of these work according to need and the other two are configured for automatic completion. all these modes can be set for different working modes under Settings Kile... Completely set.</seg>
<seg id="1839">At the beginning a new environment with the command\\ begin {Surroundings} becomes & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {vicinity} after an empty line (for the text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input will be removed and possible, the complete list of characters will be deleted. on the other hand, the list may also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. the descriptions are also removed by selecting a command. alternatively, you can also add hocks to these positions, so that an easy jump to these positions is possible using Edit Hock marks and the desired parameters can then be inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Under Settings Kile; Setting up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. different menu lists for & tex; - and & latex; commands and quivers of general language use can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the execution of environments. there must always be a few letters with\\ begin to be entered and the call of the Complete mode will result in a large list of environment commands. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completing the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the Completely Environment Options above or the key shortcut Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically captured to open the environment and it will begin\\ begin. after that the environment can be resumed in the simplest way and by pressing the input button.</seg>
<seg id="1845">After this is done, the environment is automatically closed again. once & Kile recognizes that it is a list environment, even a first\\ item command is added.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; Complete settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the desks list of the Complete mode for & tex; - & & latex; -Commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">& Kile; support custom lists of abbreviations which can be replaced immediately by longer strings. the lists can be set up under Settings Kile... Kile can be set up. for example, the file example.cwl, in which, for example, the L =\\ LaTeX entry is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, the letter L is entered and the word Completely initiated over the menu editor or the key Ctrl + Alt spacebar will be replaced by the character L by the character string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large quaters are not helpful for automatic completion. however, it has been found that many documents are written more than once in a document. thus, & Kile; the completion for all already written requests.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the Options menu... Kile can be completely shut off. here also the treshold for the display of the complete compensation can be specified.</seg>

<seg id="1852">The graphics dialog box shapes the setup of graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics to the graphics formats, the sections should be followed and followed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files, but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages. if the PDF output is required, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted with ps2pdf into a PDF file.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to be able to examine the results of the work, you need to compile the source code. all the construction tools are grouped together in groups, compilation, converting and creating view.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece; or the other conversion can be used the keyboard shortcut Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI; file in the default viewer can be viewed using Alt; 3, by means of Alt; 4 the DVI; file can be converted to a PS file and viewed by means of Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>

<seg id="1966">In the Structural tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree should be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty spaces in the text while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The section for setting Abbreviations (a type of templates) that will unfold when editing to more extensive text. abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for multiple & DTEP; s. this means there can be a valid group for PHP, in which the ifect abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Plug-ins are part-applications from third party, which can be reused by any KPart-enabled application, the best known & konqueror; when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin if it is not located on a standard like $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin at startup, so it can open the current file, the corresponding folder (path of the current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">Load component in "Read-only" mode: check if the plug-in refuses to load the load. only-Lese-KParts normally refuse to load when this option is not selected.</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plug-in: if this is enabled, testet & quantaplus; whether the entered information is correct. select to save the entry even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. (3) Debugger has been set, as well as support for the DBG debugger. instead, a Debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows different implementations via plug-ins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently only one plugin is available, support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; insert.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable debugger plug-in in the project settings. using the Options button next to the Debugger Plugin Selection box, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">When a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view where the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions. usually appears in the lower dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as shown in HTML) of the debugger is displayed. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the debugger functionality, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">This action is used to connect to the debugger if required, or it tells the plugin to listen to Debugger's demands. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally it does not have to be taken care of.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session Start the session. closes the connection to the debugger or ends the listening according to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to initiate a debug requirement. this is equivalent to using a browser to view the current document. the output of this request will be displayed in the debugger output view.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and continuously send information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens, while the script is halted, execution continues. happens before a debugging process has started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number. if this happens, while a script is halted, the execution continues.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger executes the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include, if possible.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instructs the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next one as if the current one is not.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable can be set.</seg>

<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create tag XML files, then the descriptionrc; and also tool bars. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">TagXML files (.day) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. tool bars enable fast insertion of tags in a document without the risk of a write error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folder are nothing but folder. they contain only the descriptionrc; and the TagXML files. tag folder carries the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of the TagXML and declares whether they are necessary or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users get a better insight and more information when working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing else than just element type over itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, & lt; attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for type method. specifies the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the day has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other tag. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text in the dialog. this text is determined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">This element can only happen once for each attribute. it defines the name and type of the attribute. in addition, there are other tags that describe how this attribute should be shown & etc; This is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code used to fill the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus; is used to reach the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name inside & quantaplus; used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method. can be empty or% tagname%, which means the name of the current tag.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag that summarizes the elements of a list. it can occur only once for an attribute description. it is a single element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each attribute; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; tag). this element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may occur within the tag to be defined. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Returns a list of elements that end a tag. this element is a single element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All TagXML files must start with an & XML; & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be properly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; tooltip &gt;, & lt; whatsthis &gt;, and & lt; text &gt;. this will not cause any leg breakage, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. another dialog will appear, with simple instructions to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available. currently, the verification is only done when loading the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 TagXML file. this file describes the & lt; schema &gt; element from the & W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">The following is an example of a working family 2 TagXML file. in this file, a & PHP; overload function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt;! Doctype tags &gt; & lt; tag name = "class _ name" type = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / tag &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as easy and there is an editor for editing DTD's DTD settings. this can be ediedescriptionrc; for a newly created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should create a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD statement. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / en) Nickname = The simplified name of the DTD. if not specified, the name is used as nickname.</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be created with settings actions... click New action to create the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The keyboard shortcut assigned to this action. by clicking the user defined button, a keyboard shortcut can be assigned; with Keiner, the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the detailed settings and in the execution of the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited), which change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), can be started. examples from & quantaplus; even the Quick Start dialog or the various see in... Actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First you have to specify the name of the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh. In this way, the script tries to find: $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we are replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with PID of the current & quantaplus; if of & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text unique is added to the PID #. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; the external script is used.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can be input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be specified, which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is normally only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The output of the executed application can also be redirected according to the input. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output; error messages, directed to the default error output. it can be specified, what should be done with the text written to the standard output by setting the input field output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags in logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in given case, it is not too many, therefore you can create a toolbar with the name of the market.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a toolbar has been added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self-explanatory. pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all necessary fields and add the tag to the right tool bar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete all and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable "Edit Tag," if available so that an input is possible while using the action.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphics more programs (or where else it is located in their distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixels by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, choose Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created icon will not only help you remember what the action does, but also all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually considered loose, stared, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user is signaled that clicking on this icon will insert a & lt; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected to the action. this happens via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and selecting the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder in which the saved icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so there are still some, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by several separators into several groups. open the tool bar to set Settings dialog from Settings toolbar. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I would like to select the separator (at the top left) for my tool bar. after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I want a quick way to have access to the Conqueror Preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separator support the grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar could believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the Start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">Save to the right folder. after ReeXML does not exist, it will be created in root folders, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the right folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc, so that its toolbar (s) will be loaded (will) when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus; for the normal user, the ability to add documentation to the scripting language or formatting language you like most. that's why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before you start your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; Repository if someone has done it for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to search an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc / language. then you have to create the docrc file.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration File [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for example PHP / PHP; 4.2 Documentation section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Section1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.1.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.2 = Sec2.html Tag 2 = tag2.html tag3 = tag2.html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can now see in the & PHP; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntac.html...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolders in the tree with its own contents. there is no known limit for the depth of the packet (except through reason) mdash; but try it by yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consistently at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder will be shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces do not affect anything, but watch & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; Resource files are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file that is used to create context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script should display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of concreted context elements to be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as you have specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your html docs there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files to the & quantaplus; -Repository for use by the & quantaplus; community. you will not get rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus; you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. at different places there is an Email menu item, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) send with email, send the toolbar's toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive from where all the others & quantaplus; users can download them. we recommend that the contributions are verified and only available if our team needs them as correct and useful to publish them. in order to make a present contribution, we recommend that resources be signed, both for our team and for the future users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading you are asked for your passphrase for your private gPG key (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the dialog New Resource, the input fields need to be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploading from DTD DTD's DTD (DTEP) menu, uploading the toolbar's toolbar, and started from the files and folders context menu in the templates and scripts tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examines & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. please read the warning notifications carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is properly signed, a message will appear stating the source of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus; but creation can be time consuming because hundreds of tag files could be necessary in tag XML format. there's the easier way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD File menu and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description to be used. then the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; will be written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that appears in the! Doctype tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when enabled & quantaplus; after converting the file descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus; there are some key concepts. to understand this and to be able to draw full benefits from & quantaplus, you must first familiarize yourself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to familiarize them with these concepts without their understanding & quantaplus; little use would bring them.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus; the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus; it stores all that is marked globally, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the administrators to backup different tool tracks, actions and patterns in the global tree, which are then available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which empowers the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the index tabs with information and toolbars. please check in, and for further information on these fields.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click the tabs with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing the current, other or all index tabs, reload, delete or upload the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS instructions to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor pane will lead to another context menu regarding the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (Cut / Copy / Insert), edit the tag under the mouse cursor, help the word under the mouse cursor or open the file if the string is designated a file under the mouse pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top end of the editor window are the editor's toolbar icons. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as default for which a set of tool bars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of tool bars is really easy. if they want to insert a single day, e.g. & lt; then click on the symbol representing the tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. now you can insert the data for this just inserted tag. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the representation with tabs are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool that provides & quantaplus; this view displays all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project by right mouse click. actions such as adding, removing, uploading or deleting files from the storage media can be done with the then displayed context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; working area. global templates are always available, local templates only for the appropriate user and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you can find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of breakdown in Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script. by clicking with the left mouse button you can access the available information to a script.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is set in the document to the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree opens.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears under the other tree views. with it, manageable attributes and namespaces can change. the application system aligned to the content allows to change all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from quantaplus; 'documentation site, you can create own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project can add, edit and view project-specific documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tabs at the bottom of the window that can be accessed using useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab shows information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to the DTD will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This index pointer shows all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts that are executed give all error messages (as there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The & quantaplus; tool bars are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the corresponding command. the chocolate side of the tool bars is the ability to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus;</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another feature of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive over & kmail;. if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can backup and load them in & quantaplus; like any other!</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the place of the & quantaplus; .conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, type. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have trouble starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 is located in the PATH in front of their bin folder. the same applies to & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE interface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While trying to create the best & HTML; editor, the developers of & quantaplus started to deal with an obvious idea: what if & quantaplus; a standalone, expandable markup language editor? well, this would make him the absolute most powerful web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for that the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be held that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community. & quantaplus; follows, in good application of free software, the idea of Why developing what already someone else has developed? thanks to the & kde; scaffolding is not only possible for users and developers, & quantaplus; so to expand as they need it for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; enables web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document interface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is possible almost every task. through the program Commander they can expand and quantaplus; without having to memorize any scripting language syntax. (more about it in.)</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it has been designed for fast web development and has quickly developed into a sophisticated editor with many powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way linked to commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL-licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More detailed documentation is available with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or helpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it, with the oldest entry being taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you attempt to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error is reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML when inserting from the clipboard, so they are correctly displayed and not misunderstood by the browser as formatting instructions.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts the text from the clipboard into & URL; spelling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s. first and foremost to insert & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection on or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a line number. this is very helpful if your & PHP; script outputs error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind of grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window where you see the display of the script sections and the debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Removing and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated once you switch to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar to the left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">If there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the cursor position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other open documents appear in the menu grouped by the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard drive. & quantaplus; -Projects are saved with the file extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. that allows you to copy video files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project to the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings like & quantaplus; the project is managed. in chapter & quantaplus; -Projects you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project Dir / toolbars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to save your toolbar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: local or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this will only create the name. actions need to be added to the toolbar by settings... or you will be asked when you exit whether you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete them from the hard drive. if you have not yet saved the toolbar, you will be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team so that the toolbar will be available in the next publication). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as an attachment.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables the uploading of tool tracks to the main server, where everyone else can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD;, which you or someone else has made and convert to & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Loading / retrieving entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTEP are to be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load will fail.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the standard (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a submenu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag preferences when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -Specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Currently this works only with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent inserting means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied if this tag is contrary to the rules.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plugins are listed below the menu items listed above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in will deactivate it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on derkate; version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; by means of the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between the different types of the user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, the switch may sometimes need time or cause unnice graphics. recommended is the index card mode, which is also the default setting, or the subwindow mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open subwindow. selecting an entry will enable the corresponding subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables displaying the status bar at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog are affecting each application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set up the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate, you will find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog will appear in which you delete entries from the toolbar, or add them and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help in line with the environment of the mouse pointer but is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus; development in financial form, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should preferably be filled from top to bottom, since, for example, after filling the project name, the entire directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all those paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 project project properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering the name, file is filled in automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the & quantaplus; project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase and without spaces with the extension webprj (e.g. foo.webprj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, except you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field blank, the default settings of the selected protocol will be used. depending on the remote host setting, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates for the project are saved. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars for the project are stored. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars as standard. if a common collection of files is used for various projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows to insert files from the local file system into the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. for server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Check if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project will be included. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make a precise selection for good manure.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the root folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or, by removing the tick, clip from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded from the menu under Project Properties in the menu tree in the Windows subwindow or Shift; F7.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in detail. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of file names (placeholders is possible), which are ignored for project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to top, including files listed in .cvsignore, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows the debugger to be selected. currently only Gubed is supported. more information about Gubed can be found in. the Debugger plugin can be set using the Options button.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profiles subwindow, upload profiles (see in) can be set, as well as the display of a tree view for the content of the server for each profile by hitting one's own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can activate event actions and add, modify or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a pre-determined event occurs, such as the backup of a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was open. this behavior cannot be influenced at present.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the menu project or the icon Project open from the toolbar. the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file is automatically saved. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when & quantaplus; changes changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project tree view gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, however the entries are missing opening and opening with... in the context menu on the right mouse button:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows removal of the current profile. if only one profile is present, the button is displayed to prevent the removal.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the core memory and forgotten when it comes to programs. this option is useful when frequently uploading files is necessary and the rather unsafe password on the disk cache option is not available.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many high-loading profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server on which the files should be copied. either a full qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should select from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it at your discretion. the password will be saved on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with knowledge of programming can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is only one set of files and tool tracks. there can be many views in a project, i.e., by simply swap the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be saved, opened or deleted from the Project or Project Toolbar, accessible via Settings toolbar project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus; this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus; to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, tool bars are in & quantaplus; it is best customisable using the toolbar's toolbar. use and add-on differ. adding tool bars is treated at the bottom of the Adding tool bar section.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the icons on it can be set either by context menu (right click on the toolbar), in which a new toolbar can be created, any other actions such as toolbar buttons or toolbar buttons can be executed, leading to the dialog where it can be specified, which actions on this or other toolbar should be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (icon) on a toolbar, the actions will be removed and action processed, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings toolbar... and Settings can be set..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are essential document skeletons, code schnitzel and files to link. & quantaplus; used templates basically like a usual file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move or link any directory available to the system into the template tree. templates have in & quantaplus; in about the limitations you submit for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each submission before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents by means of shortcuts (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree using global templates.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be of any text document type. on the basis of these templates new documents can be created. normally, more specific documents are nested in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree among global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This type of template is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can contain everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl. some examples are available in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure compiled in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc.) and select File As template Save as a local template....</seg>
<seg id="2204">As soon as this is done, note that (even if it was saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree under project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be easily dragged and dropped onto the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. all file management functions can be used for this purpose, for example to drag and drop or paste over the file tree of Konqueror.</seg>
<seg id="2207">In the file tree or project files you can click on a folder on the right and select a site template, enter a name for the template and back up. by default, it is backed up in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very targeted approach. you can set headers and footers or dynamically combine them with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files contained in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder, right-click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates. this selection is hidden as soon as parental attributes are inherited.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits all except the regular folders in the template overview. if a root folder is set, it would fundamentally disable templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text module. if nothing appears, you probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows a prearranged or copied text for templates in this folder. this could be common headers or footers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy content templates into a folder with special headers / footers to equip a whole presentation with the appropriate headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (display the right mouse button) through a complete command file for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be accessed from the View menu. the first mode replaces the source editor by the VPL; Editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and a cursor appears. then you can edit and switch back to the source code editor where the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor on a document that contains & PHP; a small green symbol shows the dependency of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP, the source editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first, except that at the same time the changes are visible in both the source editor and the VPL; editor and the cursor in the source text editor and VPL; editor is active, this mode is already active, the keystroke pushes the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronization distance between the VPL; editor and the source editor can be set via Settings Quanta. after choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in the selection, the recommendation can be set automatically. in principle, the recommendation is: a small span for fast machine and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the website, the tools document properties are to be selected. this allows editing of invisible tags when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL; editor. this can be used to reduce the following:</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storage of information about the document itself, e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. Meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. a click on the list allows to change the content, such as keywords in the column name and keyword keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of shaping the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. changing the list is just as possible with the Meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style sheet by pressing the File Open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">Use of the cursor is possible, as in a word processing, by moving the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strange. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted using a button or a button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags is done in the same way via the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags does not remove, e.g. when an anchor day, surrounded with text, must be removed any other tag anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some toolbars such as the Tables Assistant or the Listen assistant are disabled. they will later work in & VPL; in this release, the tables or lists must be used.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the analysis of style sheets. unlike other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; to successfully compile, you will need other libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already present at a typical installation of & kde.</seg>
<seg id="2229">New in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb-compatibility mode, orphaned holding points can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Xsldbg determines the complete path from a file name without path indication. file names in the same folder as the top loaded style template file name with relative path to the work folder con xsldbg is, for example, a style template file.. / en / xsldoc.xsl loaded, the following entry is possible:</seg>
<seg id="2231">In this command, a partial or complete agreement with a presage named myQNAME or a specified mode name will be checked. & eg; template matches with any of the myME that contains the string template.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Each namespace in the specified "myME" is extended according to the rules defined by the namespace defined in the XSL source file. xsl: test1 becomes & eg; extended to http: / / www.w3.org / 199 / XSL / Transform: test1</seg>
<seg id="2233">This is done automatically when loading the first template by xsldbg. stopping points are re-checked shortly after the start of each iteration.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was a lot of conflicts when merging.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see exactly what had changed within these lines. and there was no clue to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. the merge of these changes was a little nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a row and changes to white notes. later, a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison windows.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merging is fully supported. this is useful when two persons independently of each other work on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps & kdiff3; in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge entire folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in the folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you frequently need to check code, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white notes and tabs are displayed. if rows differ only in a certain number of white characters, you can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files differ.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders then you can ease the typing by writing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 2 folder 1 folder 1 folder 1 folder 3 folder 3 folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows manual typing of file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog notes your selection and displays them again next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">With the button folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders will be introduced. if A file is selected for A, but a folder is used for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">If merging is ticked, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not absolutely necessary to set an output file immediately. you can do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The setup button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge operation.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard to the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog, you do not have to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use Drag and Drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would first need to create two corresponding files, load them in & kdiff3; then you can simply copy, insert and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: currently you can't remove anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop of text into another program than cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse rest for a while on the line. then a small help window will show the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned to the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color Green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, you can see the color in which the file differs. if both files differ, the default color for it is red. (color for conflict in settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good in the next section (merging).</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages, where white marks are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + for example, white marks are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few, rare cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no rows. if the line breaks are activated, the line is displayed on broken lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info-line with the inscription output:, the file name and [changes] if you edited the result. usually, it already contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts have been resolved, saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons Jump to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparative windows are used, each distinction must simultaneously be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes, no more line is left in the group due to automatic merging or manual editing; there is only one placeholder in the case that you change your mind and perhaps still choose another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a selection that you may copy and insert elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflicts; appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. carefully follow this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources ignore the numbers or ignore Ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">This navigates mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in any of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side down, side down, beginning, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the Auxiliary window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. with the Insert key, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of the respective group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the next / previous difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-picture upstream / Ctrl-picture) or to the next / previous conflicting conflict. note that & kdiff3; all non-automatically resolved conflicts are still regarded as conflict. therefore, conflicts between resolved and unresolved conflicts must be distinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the selection to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option Selection automatically copy. if this option is checked, whatever you mark, will be automatically copied to the clipboard and no manual copying is required.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use carriage return + newline feed\\ r\. Kdiffusion 3 does not keep the lenders of the source files, so you should use & kdiff3; also not with binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be saved automatically when loading and restored at the next start. (setup menu Settings &gt; Kdiffusion 3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Select a font with a fixed width. (on some systems the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">If you activate this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the chosen font does not support this display then nothing happens.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be routed. on these systems, the Preferences knob automatically introduces an unjust color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">If this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key. otherwise, a tabulator symbol is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">If you press enter or return, the indentation of the previous line will be used automatically for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, any selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard, no manual copying to the clipboard will be omitted.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used choice on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files, & kdiff3; first, to find all the identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white marks can be ignored. the second step compares each line.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) store a carriage return character '\\ r' and a line feed '\' at the end of a line, others only save one newline character '\'. usually, ignore & kdiff3, but then files with different sizes might be displayed in the side-by-side comparison, although they may be disabled. during merging, this option must be disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">In default this option is disabled. in the first part of the analysis numbers and corresponding characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2332">In default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white notes.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Search intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective for complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict has passed.</seg>
<seg id="2335">This is useful when white notes are less important in many files. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the Select A / B / C functions for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are discussed in the chapter for scanning of folders and executing a merge. see documentation for directory comparison and merging for details.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Change this option does not affect the current program. you must & kdiff3; quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set there globally across the control center.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">Above the encoding fields for coding a short notice appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding is individually adjustable for each file, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can define the encoding of the output of pre-processing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress highlighting of changes in white notes in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This option is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color coded overview column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C will be displayed next to the normal still a second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply hide the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menue.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you consider the differences and then decide to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as preset name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file is maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it is first passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command was specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this pre-processing command. the output of the command is only used for line reconciliation. you can write your own pre-processor that corresponds exactly to your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind this is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the Diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this pre-processor command for line synchronization to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'This. * is an accomplished expression of the text found on each string. the\\ 1 in the creation string references the found text in uppercase letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword generated text $. now, a pre-processing command for line reconciliation is required, which removes the automatically generated text: SED's /\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you're experimenting with sed, you might start to understand it and maybe you may even like those regular expressions. they're very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiffusion 3. but it is good as an example of another pre-processing command for line reconciliation. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each character between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and any hits will be replaced by nothing, thus quasi deleted.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / regexp / replacement / SCHALTER 'However, perl only needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\) is needed perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data according to the normal preprocessor will be retained for display and merging. subsequent operations only change the data that the newline Algorythmus can see.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the line-like preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The pre-processor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge entire folders recursively with & kdiff3.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a suggestion for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate cohesion and show the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... performs selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the File dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2366">If three folders are merged, Folder 1 is used as the base. if no destination folder was specified, use & kdiff3; folder 3 as destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically, not the merge. to start the merge, you must select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (further details follow.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">When you read the folder, you will be informed of a small news window about the current progress. if you stop scanning the folder, only the files that have been compared to that will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is finished, & kdiff3 shows; a list window with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is represented here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded together. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - or double-clicking on the object or by using the arrow keys for left / right. the directory menu contains two functions All subdirectories can be opened and All subdirectories can be opened with which you can open or fold all the folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">If you double-click on a file, the comparison of the file will be started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders, this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the picture above, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns.</seg>
<seg id="2376">With identical entries, however, the color is also identical, even if the age of entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered identical if their entire content is identical. then folders have the same color. at folders, age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is green, then yellow and later when it is old, red becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical, but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical, but not C: copying C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical, but not A: copy A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a folder and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same file type (e.g. if A is a file and B a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such defective objects exist, merging cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The syncing mode is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified, and when the option synchronizes directories is active. then selects & kdiff3; the necessary action, so that both folders are identical. if for one entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as visible file name for the output file only B; copied directly after the merge & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">If two folders are merged and the option New file is selected instead of merge (unsafe), then examines & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the same date appears, then an error message appears: files are different, but the date is identical.. Solange those errors are not fixed, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merging, one file is executed after the other. the status column shows fervently if the merge was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if the merge is complete, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the File Comparison Method is selected Full Analysis, KDef3 will display additional columns. these contain the number of unresolved, deleted, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts only appears if three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected entry (file or odds) or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (even in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Note: if you have not specified a destination folder, then in the Three Folder Merge mode C is used as a target, B is selected as the target and B is used for synchronizing A and / or B.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check whether all entries should be in the destination folder, even in the folder structure. there are a number of options that might skip certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select Start / continue directory merge / continue to the directory menu or press F7 (the keyboard shortcut). to merge only the current item: select Action of the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If conflicting file types still exist invalid merging actions, a message appears that points to the defective elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box appears with the Browse, Simulate and Cancel options.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then perform certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), a merge window opens (note the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">If you are finished with a file, select / continue / resume directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, an appropriate dialog will appear. then drag & kdiff3 will continue its work with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">If & kdiff3; for an error, a message appears and detailed status information. at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue to merge (F7 key), you have the option to select another action for the entry or resolve the problem in another way before you proceed with the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, these entries (in the current session) will not work together again. even if the merge operation has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered complete. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged once more.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The Settings menu of & kdiff3; (Set up Settings - &gt; Kdiffusion 3...) now has a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the pattern with a semicolon;. valid wildcards: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS. many self-generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be set specific to a .cvsignore file. (look at info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hide attribute. in other file systems, a previous point marker marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is turned on in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">If the option is turned on, symbolic links are compared. if the option is turned on, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">If the option is turned on, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is turned on, the links will be treated like normal folders and recursively searched. (note that & kdiff3; not checked for possible recursions. a link to a folder that contains a link on itself would lead to a continuous loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the Statistics columns. (the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower if it is applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders over a slow network, it might be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security. please use caution. this option is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. no real comparison takes place. the files are considered identical if they are equal. this can be useful, for example, when copying the change date. please use caution. this option is deactivated in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables syncing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified. in this mode, the merging suggestions are selected in such a way that both folders are identical. the results of merging files are also stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file is proposed as action instead of merging. (this is considered insecure because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified.) This option is turned off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, the original version will be renamed and gets the extension .orig. If an old backup file exists with the .orig extension, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of single files, not just merging entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally the folder merge view during the merge of individual files remains visible; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you don't want that, you can switch the option directory & text window to switch off the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by changing the directory & text window.</seg>
<seg id="2415">Probably you prefer to compare a file by double-clicking. however, in the directory menu there is also a corresponding menu entry. you can also merge a single file directly without first having to start the folder merge. to do this, use the current file merge from the merge menu.</seg>
<seg id="2416">This status will be lost if you read the directory again: directory menu: re-loading</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote machines.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax for local files and folders. you should consider a few things:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. contain. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters need to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, blank &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes through the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished if a link shows a file or folder. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, ftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change dates. therefore, the permissions or the modification date deviate from the original. (note the option Confidentiality of the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose is currently being the difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP starts first and foremost the built-in difference viewer. to start KDef3, press the right button of the mouse over the difference viewer and then select In KDiff3Part display from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally it takes & kdiff3; two full input files. however, if it is used as part, & kdiff3; assuming that the input file is a file in unified format. then remove & kdiff3; the name of the original files from the patch file. at least one of the two files must exist. then start & kdiff3; the patch program to restore the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the Conqueror you can click on a patch file and select Preview in - KDef3Part from the context menu. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable when the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">When & kdiff3; as part is executed, it only supports comparing two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in the KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">There are already tools called KDiff and Kdiffusion 2 (now called "pare"). furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge together like the diff3 program from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a very long time and have learned a lot by watching the sources of other programs. this is my thank you to all the programmers who have walked this path or go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the source from the sources and probably not told the configure script the correct prefix to KDE. in default configure is installed in / usr / local, but then KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white marks is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white mark is different, the line will be treated as not identical. iF similar lines for next to each other, this is is categorization but this is more often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will notice for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to design an own file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">You can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger amounts of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text, suddenly, no src is left; no src left, and the text can't be deleted. what does this mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more emphasis would be confusing and misses the purpose. please use another editor.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3, you need & kde; 3.1 or later.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDef3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of recent changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the File ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install on a system with & kde, use the following command in the base folder of & kdiff3; -Distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir specifies the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find further details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Because & kdiff3; autoconf and automake used, you should have no problems with compiling. however, if difficulties persist, please report to the & kde; mailing lists of them.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut out (Ctrl-X or Shift) to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position or replaces the current selection.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Show only differences: files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure, and therefore not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program you will need to re-read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">This also causes identical files to be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is disabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons for selecting the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be appended to the end of the selected group in the result window (if the rows already exist). if the rows are already present, they will be removed by clicking on the button accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="2449">In default, this option is disabled. differences in individual characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a mini preview of all virtual desktops. it is quite handy to see the running programs on the work surfaces, change their size, exit them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background of & Kpager, the context menu only has the two entries to set up... and end. if, however, click on an application within & Kpager, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries appear to minimize, maximize, View desktop and exit. the commands execute the following:</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & nbsp; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="2457">When this field is ticked, in the & Kpager, the names of the virtual desktops are displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field allows the & Kpager to display the numbers of virtual desktops. if it is ticked together with name, the names are provided with folder numbers, & eg; 1. desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this field is ticked, the background of each desktop is also displayed as background in the & nbsp;</seg>
<seg id="2460">If this field is ticked, the running programs are shown as small windows in the & nbsp; otherwise, only empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply display simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its standard icon and Pixmap shows a small view of the actual program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classic leaves & Kpager; in a 2xN grid, as well known from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in a horizontal and vertical row, which is very good for displaying laterally on the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move windows as symbols or with their contents. in addition, it runs outside the control bar.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Click the right mouse button within & Kpager; and then select Setting up selector... lets the dialog box appear.</seg>
<seg id="2465">Currently this cannot be changed in the Settings dialog. however, you can do this manually:</seg>
<seg id="2466">Open the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kpagerrc with any text editor such as & kedit; or vice. if you do not have write permission for the file, you must login as user root or turn to your system administrator.</seg>
<seg id="2467">Da & Kpager; part of the package is kdebase, you need a working installation of KDE base packages.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& klikes; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">If you & klikes; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & klikes; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window is called the magnification window.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In default, you can enlarge & klike; the area around the mouse pointer as a mobile loupe. alternatively, you may or may cause a selected screen area in the magnification window (selection window mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left edge of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid the mouse cursor shown in the enlarged window, select to hide the mouse pointer. please note that this is not yet able to detect the shape of the mouse pointer. this is always the default kde; / Qt; pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection box to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following way:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the mouse cursor to the magnifying window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnifier window. this also goes with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the & Shift key or use the & MMB, you can move the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection box. note that the top left corner of the selection window will be fixed and only the lower right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">You can send the enlarged image directly to the printer, save it to a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later in other applications), rotate the picture and much more.</seg>
<seg id="2490">Start or stop the update of the ad. stopping the update causes the CPU time to go to 0.</seg>
<seg id="2491">Select the refresh rate (Very low, Low, Medium, High, Very High). the higher the refresh rate, the more CPU time is required.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In this mode, a selection box is displayed. the selected area is displayed in a window.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click as soon as the mouse cursor stays on the same spot for a while. it is intended to help people who suffer from RSI syndrome (Repetitive Strain Injury Syndrome) and each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor stays on the same spot for a while. it is meant to help people who suffer from the Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and each mouse click causes pain.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, the mere moving of the mouse will cause pain. if you suffer from pain associated with your computer's use, you should consult a doctor if this has not yet happened.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify this once again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result may differ for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and executes a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2502">If the intelligent moving is activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button. this way you can drag the dragging with pressed mouse button. the smart shifting requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must pass after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; a mouse click executes.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If it is switched on, the shooting time is active (1 / 10 s). here, the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing down the mouse button waits before releasing the mouse button again if no moving of the mouse takes place.</seg>
<seg id="2505">This feature creates a slow moving to the right and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are saved in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but they can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound appears delayed, you can & kde; move to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the Rider General. there is a slider sound buffer that you can set to a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">If this setting is selected, & kmousetool is started; at any start of & kde; this feature is currently only available under & kde; please consult the documentation at GNOME or other window environments to find out how to start a program there automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Resets all settings to the values set when opening the dialog. once you have pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user.</seg>
<seg id="2509">It is best to use & kmousetool; first, with presets. in particular, you should be switched off first. if you have become accustomed to automatic mouse click, you can later remove the smart move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click, it may be necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; in the case of sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First you should be aware at which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not cause unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse at such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">When your mouse clicks, you should clean your mouse. this is usually quite simple. the trick is that you do not only clean the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you need to take out the mouse ball. how this happens is different from mouse to mouse. but it should be clear when you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you would have to see the reels. these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can be easily scratched with a flat blade or the fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts execution of & kmousetool; if you have just started shifting, this means that & kmousetool; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; use another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you run a mouse click yourself. this will reset the status of & kmousetool, and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text, try & kmousetool; still execute mouse clicks and set the cursor elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want to have it. but park your mouse on a neutral zone of the desktop if you want to make a keystroke. secure zones for the mouse cursor are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the headlines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with the smart shift, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The smart move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes time before you can handle it. it is very likely to select text, copy it to the clipboard and insert it again, or perform any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. but it will probably only cause problems once. here are some advice:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the smart delay if you just start using & kmousetool; instead mark the text by a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse click. the mouse button plays a sound like a mouse click plays. so you know exactly when the moving time starts when smart moving. later you can use the smart move even without the audible mouse click. but this requires some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To use & kmousetool, the Xtest extension for & X window must be installed. this should be the case on most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speaker and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button once the mouse is short. this program has been developed for people who suffer from RSI syndrome and pain prepares pain.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait for a certain time that a Drag process starts before the mouse button is released. in this way, dragging and dropping can be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2533">On the second page, select the default text passbook. from the text passages you can often choose text passages used without having to type them. text passages can of course be edited.</seg>
<seg id="2534">On the third page (right screen shot) you determine the dictionary for word completion. & kmouth; reads the KDE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word. in addition, you can synchronize the word lists with an OpenOffice.org-dictionary, so that only properly spelled words can be added to the word completion.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The main window of & kmouth; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences (the lower white field in the screenshot) and an expiration memory of the already spoken words (the upper white field in the screenshot).</seg>
<seg id="2536">When you have checked the mouth, you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field. each spoken proposition is appended to the expiration memory.</seg>

<seg id="2539">& kmouth; knows two ways to pass the text. select the check box if the text is to be passed to the language generator as standard input.</seg>
<seg id="2540">If the check box is not selected, the text will be passed as a parameter. you can use the following placeholders:</seg>
<seg id="2541">Of course, the command to voice output depends on your language generator. you will find this command in the documentation on your language generator. examples for this can be found in the appendix.</seg>

<seg id="2543">With the first selection box action after the selection of a text passage, you determine which action is triggered by the shortcut or by choosing a text passage in the Text passage legend or in the bar for text passages.</seg>
<seg id="2544">The selected text passage will be added directly to the input field with the selection of instant messages. with the selection of In the input field, the selected passage will initially only be entered into the input field.</seg>

<seg id="2548">With the buttons to the right of the page you can delete or add dictionaries, change the order of the books or export them to a file. below the list you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and in the selection box.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Select the language you want for this source; & kmouth; then reads & kde; documentation. the frequency of the single words is simply determined by counting the occurrence. in addition, you can compare the wordlist with an OpenOffice.org-dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary.</seg>
<seg id="2550">With this option, you can merge the available dictionaries. & kmouth; ask which dictionaries are merged, and how they should be weighted.</seg>
<seg id="2551">With this option you create a new, empty dictionary without entries. since & kmouth; automatically inserts the words you entered into the dictionary, you will create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two parts. in the upper part, the text passages are represented as tree structure.</seg>
<seg id="2553">In the lower part, you can edit a selected entry. if you selected a text passage, you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard shortcut. if you have selected a text passbook, you can only change its name.</seg>
<seg id="2554">To add actions such as new text passages or books or delete selected passages and books you can either reach through the selection in the menu bar, in the toolbar or through a drop-down menu.</seg>

<seg id="2621">Text is edited in filters before being sent to the speech-dispatcher program. they are useful for improving pronunciation, to replace misspoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker, or to deal with certain shortcomings of speech synthesis and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"" "to understand how filters work, it's important to know how the" "" "speech-dispatcher" "" "program works with a text. & ktts; differentiates four types of text." ""</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. if the output of the screen reader is read, the received orders will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning has priority and holds the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after the issue of the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages have the next highest priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; a long text on a web page, you can talk to & kmouth; someone who is just entering the room. & kde; notifications are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. any order you initiate from the card board is a text order. KSayit is an example of a applications that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not own particular urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just such a pre-read, this issue is stopped and terminated.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal alerts, messages and text orders as well as to & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters work on the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently, there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there are still further types of filters available.</seg>
<seg id="2631">String Readers replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions. & ktops; it is delivered with predefined strings filters that allow the creation of chat ememoticons such as: -) by text or for reformatting messages from & conversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; conversions use an XSLT file (XML; Style Language - Transforms) to convert & XML; from one format to another format.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speech selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the card board speaker, you can read the text of KDE messages on it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied to voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues the text to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the page below. processing by the filters is carried out in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of the standard filters. if a filter is not ticked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are executed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to add a new filter. select the type of filter, and the follow-up dialogs will be displayed below.</seg>
<seg id="2638">For setting string translation filters you have to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern. if these patterns are found in the text, the text will be replaced with the respective replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name as you like, it only has to differ from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column match and replaces it in accordance with the string from column Erset. the list is processed in the displayed order from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">These buttons allow you to load a list of words or regular expressions from a file, save or delete the current list. if you load a list from a file, the entries from the file will be appended to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter is only applied if the speaker speaks for one of the languages listed here. click the button to display a list of languages. you can also select multiple languages if you press the & Ctrl; button at the click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter multiple programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs you get with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; -numbers must leave you omitted. if, for example, & qdbus; the application ID copete-3432 indicates, you may only enter copy.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string translation filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen Filter apply when they match. if all input fields are empty, the filter is applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string translation filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. thus, the words must be limited by separators (spaces) on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no instructions to write regular expressions. if you have installed the & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; expressions can be found in the package ambigul.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transforms translate & XML; with the help of XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such transformations. however, it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the xsltproc utility must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the xsltproc program. if xsltproc is accessible through the PATH environment variable, xsltproc is enough.</seg>
<seg id="2651">With the speaker selection filter, you can send texts to a specific speaker that is set up on the card board speaker, or to a speaker with certain features. for example, you can specify that texts by kmail should be read from a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; there is a text attached to the filter, it searches a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program specifies which the text on & ktts; and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card board speaker. with the speaker selection filter, you can overwrite the selected speaker.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter is applied if the text contains the typed regular expression. is installed on your system of the & kde; editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can call this one by clicking the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Here you can specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker is selected that best meets the desired requirements. click the button on the right to display the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to save or load your subscriber settings or delete all settings.</seg>

<seg id="2677">The 'speech-dispatcher' program uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand and extend for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The program xsltproc is used for the support of SSML and for the & XML; conversion filter is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile and manage, you need a current KDE development environment (version 3.4 or later), including the cleibs package and the speech files for the 'speech-dispatcher' program.</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code from & ktts; from the source file for kdex.html or downloaded the tarball each night, compile and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before you use & ktts, first check whether speech synthesizers are working properly with your speech synthesizer. to do so, you can use the shell script spd-conf.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; the program kttmsgr should be developed so that the setting of speech-dispatchers is directly possible and the script spd-conf is no longer required.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is disassembled into individual sentences; the user can go back to sentence or paragraph, repeat the output or stop the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">For example, if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it will be used, otherwise the best matching speaker will be chosen. if you want to know more about how and desktops; select a speaker you will see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">If you click on the Add-on tab to add a speaker to the list or click Edit, the card menu will be displayed. for example, the setup of the module for Festival Interactive will be shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival is included in PATH, you just have to enter festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the character encoding for text that is passed to the festival. when voices are known, this setting is automatically done. generally, Western languages are ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak are using ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders, you adjust the volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you cannot select some regulators and show this grey, the voice you choose will not allow these settings to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like MultiSyn voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with larger memory consumption) the first set will be synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not set up a speaker (or forget to click on Apply).</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window appears at the start of ttsmgr. otherwise, only the icon in the system section is visible after the start, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and kttsmgr doesn't work yet, it will appear in the system area once KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here all orders in the queue are listed, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sets and the currently processed set. the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card board speaker.</seg>

<seg id="2703">On this card you can set up special actions that are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktops; processes four types of voice orders:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and holds these orders. after the issue of the screen reader is read, the received orders are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next priority. this level is important news such as & eg; processor is subject to hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text. these orders are resumed after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">News have the next priority. a message interrupts normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that pronounces messages. if you are & eg; just read a long text on a web page, you can start with & kmouth; nevertheless someone who is entering the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning, or the output of a screen reader, add & ktts; insert the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory message are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voices, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of e.g. Abbreviations. SSML is part of the VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & tts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following restrictions exist:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British male) as this is the standard voice, the festival is used when issuing SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the Festival configuration dialog are not set to 100ft.%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>

<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and punctuation detection filters (SDB filters). SBDs can start text into individual sentences. this allows you to start typing faster with reading, since only the first set has to be synthesized, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this directly.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you see the punctuation detection filter. at the first start of & ktops; as default a set-limit recognition filter is set up automatically. you can change its settings or add other set limits detection filters, but beginners will not be discouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by selecting it. switch off the speaker selection and enter text for reading. switch the speaker selection again, change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker changes. of course, you must have more than one speaker, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktops; then you can start reading faster, since only the first sentence has to be processed and not the whole text block, which can take a very long time,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then stop or abort text orders on the card board, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the regular punctuation detection filter is automatically set up when you start kttsmgr for the first time. it cannot be shut down, only removed. do not change anything to that filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Punctuation detection filters compare text with a regular expression for punctuation and insert a tabulator mark (decimal code 8) at the propositional boundaries. note that the standard bylaws identification filter retains the punctuation.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD-filters are never applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warning messages, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal punctuation detection filter from mistake, you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ sbdrc contained in it.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the Speaker Selection tab, you can overwrite the subscriber settings for the application. the card is displayed if</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the default speaker (the highest on the card board speaker). in other words: no speaker properties are specified.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use of the most suitable speaker, which has all the characteristics of an appointed speaker. if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that best meets the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the properties of the desired speaker here. if this feature does not matter, enter nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Mark this check box if the property is to take precedence over other properties. you can also set multiple markers here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in the output of the output, it is always treated as a priority property. you will rarely use this property. the only case you might want to specify the attribute language is that a certain application will send text in a different language than the one set in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the field of speaker, which is most likely to delete the following, click on the Standard Speaker button and then use the Speaker closest to the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case 0 is the last word order in the queue. you can also specify an order number. (without the order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Kttsmgr immediately crashes when it is started. I compiled Debug support, but I don't get backtracking.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer 0.8.x is the command recently-register-0.8. if the problem is not solved this is probably a non-compatible version of GStreamer installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work if I play music with another application at the same time. if I stop a text assignment, freezes & ktts; one. on the & Console; appears a message stating: Unable to open PCM.</seg>
<seg id="2748">There is a problem on your system that conflicts with ALSA are likely to occur, which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PCM devices. please refer to the website of the ALSA project (dmix) on www.alsa-project.org.</seg>
<seg id="2749">I have uploaded an extra voice for festival from the internet. I have installed it and can use it in festival, but ktzmgr does not show this voice.</seg>
<seg id="2750">Add the new voice in the file $KDEHOME / share / apps / ktsud / festivalue / vocals. if this is successful, please send a patch along with the & URL where you found the voice to the developer.</seg>
<seg id="2751">On the Audio Card Audio there is a setting speed. to make this work, the program must be installed sox and can be found via the environment variable PATH. some Synthesizermoduls such as Festival Interactive even offer a setting for speed. depending on the selected voice, it is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The settings for speaking speed are ignored when & tts; & HTML; pre-reading. (this is because the HTML is converted to SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for converting & HTML; to & XML; (see) or, if you are very brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; -after-SSML reforming filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2753">I don't manage to read websites with a female voice. I have set up a female festival speaker, but & ktts; read the web pages with a male voice.</seg>
<seg id="2754">At Festival 1.95 beta, the Tag Sable GENDER does not seem to work. in order for the festival to produce no errors, the xsl file rejects the GENDER tags to convert from SSML to Saber. the same also applies to the VOICE tags.</seg>
<seg id="2755">I have added an own string translation filter and now I can go in & ktts; no more set-up or go back. on the index erunner jobs is shown, the order consists only of one sentence. what am I doing wrong?</seg>
<seg id="2756">You may not filter out punctuation marks (point, question mark, exclamation mark, comma and semicolon). instead, use a puncture limiter filter instead.</seg>
<seg id="2757">Alsa (Advanced & Linux; Sound Architecture). Alsa is on most systems with & Linux; already installed. (www.alsa-project.org)</seg>
<seg id="2758">GStreamer in version 0.8.7 or later. note: make sure that the modules are registered for GStreamer by calling the command recently before using GStreamer. (HTTP: / / gstreamer .freedesktop.org)</seg>
<seg id="2759">Some users experience conflicts with the audio output in connection with ALSA. if your system also counts, you can't simultaneously play music and read a text. & ktops; in addition, if you stop a text order and then start another one. possible solutions for this problem can be found on the ALSA website (dmix).</seg>
<seg id="2760">With July 2005 aKode still does not support real breaks. if you hold a text order in & ktts, the current set will be read before.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The audio-program sox is used for general setting of speaking speed, but otherwise it is not mandatory. Debian users can sox with the apt-get install sox command. the program is already included on most & Linux; CDs already included.</seg>
<seg id="2762">If you have downloaded a tarball (with tar-packed archive), log in as a normal user and unzip the tarball to a matching folder. switch to this folder and enter the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2763">In & kde; 4, the module & arts; probably removed or at least only created on request.</seg>
<seg id="2764">The following modules for voice synthesizers are created by default. some of them have a runtime dependence of non-free software. (non-free according to the guidelines of Debian distribution).</seg>

<seg id="2769">Festival is one of the best free TTS synthesizers whose source code is open. the quality of the voices is generally good, and several voices and languages are supported.</seg>
<seg id="2770">You need to install at least one language. help can be found in the instructions provided with the festival. if you want to read web pages, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone.</seg>
<seg id="2771">For these voices you need to compile an additional module, so you need the source code of the festival. the German voices are subject to restrictions on passing on.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This voice requires Festival 1.95 beta or later. the voice is still in an early stage of development. if you set up the Russian voices, you must enter the voices MSU _ ru _ NSH _ diphone. choose a Cyrillic (8-bit) encoding, such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2773">The festival is usually included in the distributions & Linux distributions. therefore, please check the CDs of your distribution first.</seg>
<seg id="2774">If you want to use the Polish, Hungarian or Czech languages, the encoding option must be set to ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2775">If you want to use the Russian voice, the encoding option must be set to an 8-bit Cyrillic such as koi8-R.</seg>
<seg id="2776">Festival can be used together with the MBROLA; then festival takes over lexkalische Analyse and & MBROLA; generates the audio output. the & MBROLA; program and the MBROLA; voices can be downloaded by</seg>
<seg id="2777">Note that MBROLA is not a complete language extraction system. & MBROLA; generates language from diphone files. you need additional software to create this diphone. Festival produces these from & MBROLA; required diphone. txt2pho can also create diphone from German text. more information can be found here.</seg>
<seg id="2778">In this process, additional wrapper code will be added to the festival to use & MBROLA; voices to voice synthesis. note that the & MBROLA; voice files are not installed in the & MBROLA; folder but in the folder festival / lib /.</seg>
<seg id="2779">IMS German Festival is a changed version of Festival for German and MBROLA; Voices. required either Festival Version 1.4.1 or Festival 2.0 (1.95beta). first install Festival and MBROLA; then download MS German Festival from</seg>
<seg id="2780">Instructions can be found in the README file in the package you have downloaded. (for use with Festival 2.0, playback of the error corrections is not necessary, you only have to recompile the festival). then add the following lines to the file festival / lib / siteinit.scm.</seg>

<seg id="2794">Start kttmsgr. on the map tab, click Add. select the Czech or Slovak language and EPs TTS speech synthesizer. if the EPOS programs are not in your PATH, enter the path to the programs on the card board speaker. in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs. enter an epos -h or say -h to get further information.</seg>
<seg id="2795">FreeTTS is a free, quelloffener voice synthesizer written in & Java; i.e. you must install the Virtual Machine on your system. with & Java; can not set pitch, volume nor speaking speed.</seg>
<seg id="2796">The command module allows you to use & ktts; with any voice synthesizer that can be controlled on the command line.</seg>
<seg id="2797">It is best to use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file (wav), rather than sending the output directly to the audio device</seg>
<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetworkconf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; that allows the administration of network interfaces, routing, and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & kcontrolcenter; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter;</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetworkconf; package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetworkconf; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation, a new module network settings are displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the module network settings (knetworkconf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network network settings in & KMenu; start.</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetworkconf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured, so that & knetworkconf; the device at all shows and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices installing and installing Linux will be installed and set up. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be charged by adapting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option is selected in the & kcontrolcenter; index. when starting the module network settings, this attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be detected, the manual selection is offered. it is possible to select the platform from the list that best meets the distribution and relations status. by selecting the setting non-again the definition can be made permanently. next time the network settings are started, this selection will be preset automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode. previously, all options are gray, which means that the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The Rider Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the Rider Network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up in the list and click the button to set up the desired device... to be edited in the Device Dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode selects the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings are required for the system startup at the same time. the DHCP or BOOTP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information at each system start, so no further setting is required. in the selection list, either DHCP or BOOTP will be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The manual can be used without dhcp or BOOTP to configure the TCP / IP configuration. in the IP address field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the input field network mask the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this option is selected, the system initializes the network interface when booting. if the initialization is not desirable, this option should not be activated.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Network devices can be activated or turned on as needed. switching on a switched off network device can be activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2817">Network devices can be activated or turned on as needed. switching off an activated network device will be deactivated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the IP address of the computer in the local subnet, which communicates the physical connection to remote networks and is used as standard for TCP / IP communication with hosts in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a complete domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the computer asks http: / / www.einedomain.org, DNS will resolve this name to an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator is a simple administration of this list. entries can be added, removed or altered. DNS records can be rearranged in the list by selecting an entry and upgrade or downgrading in the list with the Add or Down buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group machine to name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will display the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator for name resolution select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names known by name describes hostname to IP address links for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is primarily used when booting when no DNS servers are available. in small, completed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Normally, the list of names known by name contains some entries that support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this version of IP still in the test will replace version 4 in the future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... Add new alias dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the familiar computer and click the Add button. if the familiar computer has multiple alias names, press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry from a name-known computer from the list and select Edit.... This dialog will display the familiar computer.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be done one of the following tasks, then clicking on OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the network settings are not immediately effective in the system. in order to activate the changes, the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetworkconf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (mostly rpm packages) it is sufficient to install and kde; and Qt installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the pre-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a graphical interface tool such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; not only, but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile & knetworkconf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter important information about basic network technology is given, and in the second chapter all configuration files are discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information on the integration of the PC into a small (home) network is communicated.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently operating with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv5 has never found a big spread. IPv6 is expected to be implemented in the near future, and this description is currently focusing on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address of a network interface is ascertained. in external networks, on & eg; workstation, the network administrator is the point of contact which provides a valid IP address or, if available, DHCP can be used. in any case, the IP address cannot be chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore any use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting a gateways.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range of 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 PCs.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0, so that all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first is the so-called standard route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = your own calculator). the default route is required for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The 127.0.0.1 network address is reserved for the IP traffic in your local machine. normally, the address is assigned to 127.0.0.1 of its own so-called loopback interface, which works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this part, there are the configuration files that are affected by & knetworkconf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes changed dynamically with DSL connections, so it won't be surprised if there is another content found there in case of active DSL connections.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE, it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in SuSEconfig. another stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar which also provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packing. the second aim was to answer a question which my wife set: how much longer does it take when you secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used it must be done by & kdat; this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; pull the tape back and read the pre-tensioning information of the tape. recognize & kdat; don't know the pre-credits on the tape, you'll be asked if the tape is to be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & cdat; the pre-tensioner, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the band index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape has been inserted. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be browsed by unfolding the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, first the integration must be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& kdat; specifies by changing the symbol for the tape that the integration for the tape has been loosened and shows in the status bar a corresponding message. the tape can now be thrown out without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape can be used by & kdat, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A tape must be formatted before you can be used to store data. if your tape drive requires a formatted tape before use, this must happen before you can be formatted from & kdat. floppy tape drives usually require formatting of tape, but DAT drives are not formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and capacity, & kdat arrives; with the format of the tape. all data on the tape are lost! after completion of the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been started, the Settings dialog opens. in this dialog, you can check the selected files again and change the backup settings.</seg>
<seg id="2909">When you have confirmed the settings, the Security dialog appears. the dialog displays the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders are checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click on any of the archives and select the menu item Check....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test is started, the dialog box appears for verification. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">When you have confirmed the verification, the dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before redirecting the restore, the files that need to be recovered must be selected. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the tape drive. it will only restore the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the desired files from one of the archives with a tick. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore....</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the restore dialog will appear. in this dialog, you can check your selection again and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Once you have confirmed the restore settings, the restore dialog will appear. this dialog displays the progress of the restore process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it turns out to be necessary to re-create the tape indexfile using the tape content. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of tape:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current folder where the backup should be made. the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all the files listed under backup files, only the files in it are backed up, which are located on the same file system as the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be assigned separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">To determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Delete the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; s; & lt; lt; files was not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">You can set up the settings using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The complete path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted, and dat - before the tape is mounted, load the load to the drive. in some drives, this is necessary before read or write operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">"" "if the option is turned on," "" "tries & kdat" "" "tries to lock the ejection from the tape drive. it may not work on all tape drives." ""</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is turned on, the tape is automatically ejected when you delete & mount the tape. do not use this option on floppy Streamers.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Is the option turned on, tried & kdat; to change the hardware-calibrated block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you must & kdat; in any case tell the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">When & kdat; a tape is formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape. the content of the file is composed as follows:</seg>

<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who cannot know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users provide quick access for example to information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemlog enables experienced users to quickly access to information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; hence attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1, & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. this includes:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; provides functions with which the single protocol lines of a log file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After startup, & ksystemlog; first, the main protocol file of the system - the system log - will not appear to you, and it opens instead of a small message window, so you have & ksystemlog; very probably not started with system administrators. the protocol files are usually found under Linux in / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criteria or by entered strings. to do so, enter a string into the filter bar. the list of the log lines will now be changed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in default, a log line will only display if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can of course also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the corresponding column. for example, in the log file system protocol, select the column process, and also enter the name of a process in the log file, so show & ksystemlog; all log-lines sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important log-lines. log-lines of level errors are displayed with a more conspicuous color as log-lines of level hint. the colored representation of log-lines can be turned off an alignment dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you just want to display a particular process (for example in the system log or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can be useful, for example, if you want to examine the output of a particular command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use Filter Panel.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can select to jump to new lines in the main window context menu to display all the new log-lines added.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows to display several log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own web page on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further up-to-date information about the sources of the & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion repository: ksystemlog; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and also named so) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;</seg>
<seg id="2957">The System V Init is quickly becoming the standard for controlling the program start when starting the system in the & Linux; world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to address historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting it. Linux; kernels first look under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc rather than directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a whole set of scripts. basically, you need a script for any system service you wish to start when you restart the system or switch to another running level. however, system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls are after rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be located under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, which has to do with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches for the init at various places and starts the first one that it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard running level is entered in / etc / inittab. in the beginning section you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change this, you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up, you can fix it by restarting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d then you'll probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts manually by hand on the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would hold the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a k, the script is called stop with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script is called with the start argument.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server running level that runs only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. in addition, I could also have a user runlevel that starts & kdm; & kdm;, network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or a different pointing device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the field of available system services to one of the six Runtime levels to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will only be removed from its original running level (or its position). this will only happen if they extract an entry from the available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: items are moved if you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry existed previously in the target range of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorter number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorter numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry to a different running level, move it with cut to clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired running level with pasting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorter number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to switch the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before executing them.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise, they are restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I experimented with the standard Runners, and now the machine is constantly changing. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single-user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the standard running level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have some system services with & ksysv; for execution under runlevel X, but they are not executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you need to edit additional files in / etc, which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration for the proprietary configuration programs of these distributions but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using another distribution, please check that all configuration files are available that are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply terminate without notice if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even vary from version to version. if you use another distribution, please send me information about the Runtime, so that it can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter customization of & kuser; to start reading.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you need to save it. you can either use the corresponding toolbar icon or save the Save In the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">& kuser; is a simple application. the main window consists of two tabs, the user and the user group list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. the user or group properties dialog will appear.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed if you have enabled advanced system settings. only if you have enabled wildcard restrictions (quota) for users, a card board will be created on which you can make individual settings. additional card cards appear if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The card password manager appears if Shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This card only appears if space limitation (quota) is enabled and initialized for at least one embedded file system (identifiable by the quota user / quota group file on the file system). here, parameters can be modified for each user, with the limitations of the space in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected using the field file system with limited space limitation</seg>
<seg id="2997">The map card group informs about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs can be found in the Primar Group field. furthermore, the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The group dialog features a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the Add Add button on the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group works analogue.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module you can install the LILO boot manager, add, remove, and change boot password, change time to boot of the standard operating system, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, change, and more.</seg>
