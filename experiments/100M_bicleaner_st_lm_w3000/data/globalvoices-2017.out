although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and run their sports .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
at the age of 14 I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as the Jura @-@ student , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ n@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; free to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was as if it is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona was only intensi@@ fying my admir@@ ation for the USA .
I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his great@@ ness .
then came Donald Tr@@ ump .
much has been written about this man &apos;s x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully .
he tells exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in dro@@ ves for him .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can prim@@ aries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person , I asked myself ?
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever person with whom I could conver@@ se about Islam and his past .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s world@@ view coinci@@ ded with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er .
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who struggles for her life for the sake of the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son .
it still fits to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Le@@ aks , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump cleared his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a halt and the counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
but it turned out that they were the exception to the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , pres@@ idency made a man despite - or perhaps just because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for dump because they shared either its rac@@ ism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and in@@ capable of understanding those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for dump because they want to reg@@ ain control of a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ?
perhaps . perhaps .
however , you can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look different from him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( note ) : as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; revol@@ ving the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the white and whi@@ plas@@ h word play , as the great van Jones called , has killed just what America has done so splen@@ did@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have , America welcomes everyone .
for this country chose as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man , whose story , as he says himself , would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
with the election of Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , however , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to Hell with diversity , religious freedom and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of his election .
on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the crowd responded with a loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices lou@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that &apos;s not your America . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps country , said the news .
and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , couldn &apos;t find a place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love of music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what does the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca province have in common with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ah ?
that the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is at the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which , with their musical instruments , has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it .
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest in Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero &apos;s community in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of Mexico &apos;s poor@@ est provinces , is known for its abuse and gang violence .
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare gli@@ mmer of hope .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they get out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bu@@ stle you learn day for day , trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pani , bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from litter
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing - a village located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with prepared instruments consisting of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers started turning parts of waste into instruments under the guidance of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez .
the instruments mim@@ ic viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all produced from the garbage .
the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc .
in an article by the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ Ã¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
at first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin made of rub@@ b@@ ish .
today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces about one billion tons of tr@@ ash every year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - as the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music all around the world .
the orchestra even played in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat IU@@ U fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published by En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports on international , practi@@ sed solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content together .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the waters of Liberia , before the other coast of Africa visited .
the East African countries were correspon@@ dingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their shores .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles quickly mobili@@ zed themselves against the ship . they refused to stop one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing permit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply denied everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ members Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he was not able to catch fish there .
in the end , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of lo@@ oting the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( illegal fishing ) .
the members of this network , along with Somalia and Madagascar , are the six countries that at that time had exp@@ elled the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , Head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , and therefore it is extremely difficult to detect .
by the deliber@@ ate cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems which have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once imped@@ ed by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the au@@ ger stamp , with which information was circul@@ ated between individual countries , the actions are happening in real time , with trac@@ eability at F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about suspi@@ cious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection .
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . even so suspi@@ cious routes can be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship dischar@@ ges its caught fish on the road to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal liability .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information , which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially un@@ profitable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm advoc@@ ating the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supporting F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a closed front door
the aforementioned platform has been created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year because of the illegal fishermen who enter East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world . among these illegal fishermen .
their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , fantasy names , fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they exploit the lack of international co @-@ operation and make use of the weaknesses of an un@@ interrupted organized control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You must@@ n &apos;t run my harbor &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; yet another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and just this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
until now , the closed front function works .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspect vessels .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found fle@@ eting ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international body to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he builds a system that helps F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly evolving , also helps to detect the illegal ships that love to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and provides technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information . it is designed to help F@@ ISH @-@ i find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it .
recently , Sky@@ Truth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform alongside Google and Marine Protection Organization Oce@@ ana : a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed anywhere in the world by means of the position of each single tracking ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors , to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ew char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows tracking of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only det@@ est criminals but also sc@@ are them off .
ships that previously had no license and could hardly reck@@ on with consequences now know they are being observed .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i are seeing a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries sales since fishing boats have purchased more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i had helped Somalia to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found tow@@ ing nets on board where they were banned .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; six countries joined forces in 2015 , the West Africa Task Force . they are now tackl@@ ing illegal fishing according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Safety is the aim of bringing even more such initiatives and structures into other regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph : in October it presented Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under a false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without license and were used tow@@ ing nets that are now prohibited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ship had also penet@@ rated into forbidden waters , reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London .
their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to escal@@ ate : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot;
street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are regarded as a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the im@@ pe@@ achment of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .
this picture of MarÃ­a Ale@@ j@@ andra Mor@@ a shows a close @-@ up of the demonstration in Mar@@ ac@@ ai@@ bo in 2014 .

after the government of Venezuela opposed the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on im@@ pe@@ achment , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations about the country &apos;s political and economic crisis , ran into empt@@ iness by gathering on the streets .
under the has@@ h tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the refund of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them .
the debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the flat @-@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the Andes regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the centrally located north @-@ west of the village of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the country &apos;s political and economic situation wor@@ sens continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the im@@ pe@@ achment of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but in the end the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in her latest article the Con@@ text of the Governance Code as follows :
in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine , the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to reg@@ ain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance , Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ Ã¡@@ tica , or short MU@@ D ( for example : round Table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together called on the demonstr@@ ators to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly . in addition , a twelve @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , were scheduled to continue on 3 November .
the call was commented on Twitter , among other things , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil war , and on November 3 all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

on Twitter there are pictures that tell of arguments , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
especially large waves beat the news of police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government .
hours later they were able to leave the cathedral safely , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an state of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a :
the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards do not have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round that forms the level of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for an official ab@@ sent@@ e@@ ei@@ sm - this was now proven in the eyes of many by the presence of inn@@ um@@ erable people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ ek &apos;s Media Lab@@ s for this purpose :

here is your im@@ pe@@ achment !
on the road !
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others evaluate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that , from their point of view , has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to refra@@ in from cri@@ p@@ pling critical voices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or shopping .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of CÃ³r@@ doba .
as an adult man Qui@@ j@@ ano now said to his father as part of the big La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³r@@ doba .
during the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained the family secret .
in the situation at that time , I thought it was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years , one does not realize that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Secret Service Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .

no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the scale of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father .
his story shows the great power a parent has about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall with us . there I had befri@@ ended a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you were friends with one of the ERP .
pass only that they don &apos;t dec@@ eive you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina .
that &apos;s why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work at the military base .
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine .
on the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoner .
these were all kinds of documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything .

&apos;@@ That the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &apos;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack where cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - simply everything possible .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it .
that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks , where the stolen objects were par@@ ked and kept me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I se@@ w@@ ed in and saw a couch where people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was tied up there .
they un@@ le@@ ashed a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , over@@ laid him with water , and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts in the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ ble ... like a fil@@ thy wind .
years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I recognized the smell right away and I realized that this is the smell of a body in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How is it possible that a person can do so much suffering to another ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound and tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
he spoke to &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people were isolated at the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me away ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero gathered and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to survivors of the survivors , the Zi@@ vi@@ cian Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial , tried the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the path on which the duc@@ ts came here .
when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra till the order from above came to be reloc@@ ated .
this was a lie - eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought home all kinds of stolen things .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military character , which one has fought against an enemy that has been fought .

but if one goes into a house and ste@@ als the refrigerator , the record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
this is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; And you who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded with rage , struck me and scre@@ amed :
if you go so far , then I will find you and kill you .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
my father was like this .
I do not have a single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo of then , on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ tle jum@@ per made of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes to his home .
at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I answered , no problem , they can lay me a burden of what they wanted .
I was there anyway to cancel .
&apos;@@ the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &apos;
now , where I am older , I feel regre@@ ts .
I have children . once you have children , you realize the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , so you have executed people during the dictatorship . but why do the bodies disappear ?
why do kids kidn@@ ap ?
one day , my father brought a girl with her mother , whose mother had been killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why their bodies disappear ?
did these people also not have families to whom one could pass on their mortal remains ?
the dis@@ appearance of cor@@ p@@ ses is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when democracy was introduced , they brought machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but anything remains of course always .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I even stayed with the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought of showing my father was born during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I did not blame him for all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I haven &apos;t killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; they supposedly defended were actually good .
then I scre@@ amed :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he just said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I was reporting the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed . I have finally cancelled my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest pending before the end of the trial .
he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes : including heavy , illegal de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 154 instances , murder in 98 especially severe cases , torture followed by death in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment .
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended due to the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 The oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases and sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ Jud@@ gment : murder , torture and rape by officials . # Es@@ War@@ state terrorism
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant woman in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human minds .
the Court of Justice is an historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the process lasted more than three years , but the research took 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country where La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial could be built there , which is now being run by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the translator with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can let your driver &apos;s license be extended .
the photo was diff@@ used in the social media .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where one can pro@@ long his driver &apos;s license last month witnessed a particularly mis@@ guided translation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older mot@@ ori@@ es@@ man &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means wrong@@ ly - perhaps also with a malicious h@@ ind Th@@ ank &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; translated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incorrect translation was to be read from the 1st to the 20th of September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which has been widely divided into social media .
the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . it was also he who drew attention to the local newspapers .
the Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , which was published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could it result in such an English translation ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the incorrect English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the more appropriate , even gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she stated that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed the phenomenon of &apos; terrible &apos; elderly mot@@ ori@@ sts in Japan and wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ ori@@ sts , who are implic@@ ated in accidents across the country , is quite a cause of concern . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , which corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period .
the repor@@ ter , named above , brought comments to the light in the article published on Yahoo , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently had against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo for the translation error , among others , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible driving &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; So incorrect is the translation actually not at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ is@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre errors in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and actively language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate the translation into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations within the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is rated as the best , is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the sentences and en@@ ig@@ matic phrases that are created by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest English phrases in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that often decorate T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery or at least be harmless . but from large corporations or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , more careful translations can be expected .
the city of Kyoto hopefully uses a more serious source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar of Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel .
later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organised by op@@ posi@@ tional groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Ma@@ du@@ ros .
the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the Executive and the Supreme Court themselves .
Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was c@@ apped and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offerings such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest .
traditional media have been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the commission for telecommunic@@ ation threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot;
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again .
it is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ in@@ fil@@ ek later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transm@@ its its sessions .
earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique through which the DNS server requests certain domains flaw@@ ed .
if a web site is blocked by the DNS , the server will prompt or deny the request when you visit such a website .
we acknowledge a DNS ban : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es was det@@ ained in Car@@ ac@@ as live .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it is also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive training
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and g@@ athers evidence of other cri@@ es , who became victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a structural report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , falling schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re @-@ released by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she once again returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she became ten years old , she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls , who are forced to work , are called Cri@@ adi@@ ta to go to school .
the business is quite simple : a large family with little money hands over her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more abundant family . in exchange , the child receives food , an education and a roof above the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to pay for countless days of house@@ work , which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift .
the practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for several years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls .
she spoke with cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected evidence , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude that is in@@ oc@@ ulated by the Cri@@ adi@@ ta guarantees in general silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; make something out of themselves , &quot; is handed over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl and justi@@ fies its exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance , who would otherwise have no education , and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never experience it .
in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , received a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed signs of severe be@@ atings . shortly afterwards she died .
she was 14 years old .
it was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military unit Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o , who works as a civil servant in the Population Register Office .
Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with just 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
at the end of January 2016 F@@ errei@@ ra struck with a stick on Mar@@ Ã­n until she suffered fatal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later , the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people gathered in protest @-@ making demonstrations and demanded that there would be no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; lam@@ ented T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a .
without papers it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control how boys and girls live under what conditions .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ gar@@ ej@@ o to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case occurs before the Court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n may be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
the Life of a Cri@@ mean
the cri@@ adi@@ ta are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik Party , where her father worked , had to sign in bank@@ rupt@@ cy and her father lost his work .
their brothers had to work now and started selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to make money .
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
in the house of her employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
on Fri@@ days for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but she didn &apos;t get unlimited food either . &quot; I needed more books from the house &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
in some evenings the host Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics , &quot; she says .
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family often because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would return home to their mother tongue guar@@ an@@ Ã­ back home .
their Lord feared that they would lose the education that they had enabled them to lose .
she was completely clear , however , that she had paid for all she got from them with their hard work .
in school too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ b@@ bing and har@@ ass@@ ment that cri@@ adi@@ s are exposed to when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter , who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
to learn .
please send me a message .
starting from Monday , if possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad got five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; likes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ u@@ by wrote that she had a eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
another woman , who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a girl from the homeland , who wants to work . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the dis@@ col@@ oration of the ad switched off again :
dear friends , I have found one . I &apos;ll see if it works with her .
thank you , I write again if something is .
the business was complete .

in the course of our history we managed to aboli@@ sh such systems like slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the early history of Paraguay ) , in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors , the con@@ qui@@ stad@@ ores , the women of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ had to pay tribute and to their wives &apos; wives &apos; ) and the system of the men@@ Ã¹ ( where the workers were treated as semi @-@ slaves ) and the system of the cant@@ u ( in which the Spanish conqu@@ er@@ ors had to pay tribute to them ) and the system of slavery , in which they become light victims of abuse and exploitation .
social ine@@ quality in Paraguay and the spectacle of power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill dict@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
image of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , modified by Global Vo@@ ices .
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty Egyptian MPs recently agreed to draft legislation on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; regulating the use and benefits of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a job would then be set up which is mand@@ ated to give citizens a permission to use social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months , with the adoption of the law , users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do so , this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a wal@@ let .
the bill , consisting of six paragra@@ phs , and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video views , and text . &quot;
it is unclear how the law is en@@ forced when it is accepted , since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should put the registration to the users . it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media enterprises .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Aman@@ dus Satt@@ ar , Par@@ liam@@ entary Member and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and a password to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
this could mean Egypt plans to establish a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . due to it , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity in order to access the network .
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research technologi@@ sts &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Human Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have a strong doubt about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be passed as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether his acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and ensures that no different nar@@ ration is present on the image surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the MP Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a legal action against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was fores@@ een for those who are found guilty of &quot; threatening public order &quot; and &quot; adding to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kur@@ dist@@ an in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ah@@ med R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Per@@ si@@ can le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the larger family of the le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belongs to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether they are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t .
why is this certain type of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large pre@@ dat@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes towards zero . when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap , R@@ aza gets out of sheer joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , R@@ aza wants to portra@@ y a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .

in early March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , who was responsible for Nor@@ theast Japan , documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom crash in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper is based in Sen@@ dai , located in the Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was an et@@ ectable pre@@ f@@ ect in Japan northeast that both experienced the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to flee because the ts@@ un@@ ami had made whole coastal cities disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma experienced a nuclear accident , and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone for this reason alone .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Special Report shows from a local point of view that progress has been reached six years later to rebuild the local residents &quot; lives .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned sub@@ stitutes ( the European flag , the flag of Sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , even six years after the catastrophe , the ev@@ acu@@ ated of accommodation shel@@ ters ( the ad@@ mits , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) must be reloc@@ ated into final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe , almost 8@@ 0,000 people were forced to live in shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such dwell@@ ings .
almost 40 percent of Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who were in homes after the disaster were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent .
the state of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools affected by disaster have opened their gates until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident caused extensive involvement in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agriculture .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , as only 6@@ 90 hectares of the land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma destroyed by 5 400 hectares are located in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures the tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far out@@ stri@@ cken .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal population is more difficult to earn their living .
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to be able to determine an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the ev@@ acu@@ ees . she in@@ quired about the status of reconstruction and how her emp@@ athy has changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in their introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more information about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to ev@@ acu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
in its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the mighty earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , disaster @-@ induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience .
of 16@@ 0,000 Ev@@ acu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent substitute houses .
according to the 2017 stand , there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside of their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the disaster areas most of the ev@@ acu@@ ees who still live in shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old , fail because the efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when people come across from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be greater than common ground .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that it connects more than it seems at first glance .
these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast , we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday , a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated on him this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a stro@@ kes . the man was identified as Augu@@ sto S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s reported that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the incident was concluded by the active ministry .
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer was beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and all the repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net , in which one sees how Prot@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s shortly afterwards hur@@ ry to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in the social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users meanwhile have donated 10,000 Brasili@@ an rel@@ ays ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while lying in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .

the drawing has been shared several times in social networks .

on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s :
Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s has witnessed a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was killed by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined the intensive care unit after he was attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stroke .
police handles
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
polic@@ emen seated at protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeakers .
this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers all over the country .
again , the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window screen .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo extensively reported on a broken glass window in order to illustrate their title pages in an illustr@@ ative manner with a photo .
O Glob@@ o , on the other hand , preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any kind of material damage .
here too the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot;
the Vill@@ ages of Des@@ i@@ du@@ str@@ alisation in Cuba
with the introduction of the Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso law , nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich &apos;s congregation , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as the Spanish sugar mill , despite the fact that there is no significant harvest of sugar@@ s on site .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the fall , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory lost its facilities , until only the steel and concrete sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stops every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are back into operation , because they have been preserved .
that was something he did not expect .
N@@ ene feels like having heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad administrative decisions and climate change .
in 2016 , the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the amount produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no longer a news .
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes .
they left only factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the price of sugar rose again about a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must be between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , published in the 2016 report on &quot; Agricultural Economics &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Food and Food Organisation .
if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will certainly go down in history , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people , received their full sal@@ aries for further education .
the same happened at the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he repe@@ ats most is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first anniversary of the year , the first letters began to come .
it was officially written documents , which differ@@ ed only with respect to the parts that would be removed , the address and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was passed and the letters were getting more and more frequent .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another facility , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved against his will in the shut@@ down of the factory in which he helped to build .
with every part he removed he dis@@ mounted one of his 31 working years .
the most advanced industrial area in Cuba and the most important workplace was wi@@ ped out .
in many cases , no alternatives were created for the jobs and services generated by the plants in the municipalities where they were located .
we will never know if during the mamm@@ oth speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president looked into the eyes of the persons present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well .
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only high by grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years the congregation of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ e learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to spy on it , they also stopped to hal@@ ve the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms .
without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories .
they have been replaced with spare parts .
without a perspective for the future , many young people left the region .
a food factory was created in the area , whose production does not even serve to supply the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand peso a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not an im@@ it@@ ating person , yet he does not forgive the lies that he told him .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene walks into retirement at the age of 65 , not because it lacks force , but because it is bitter@@ ly bitter .

young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are occupied with themes that are important to them . they do this by hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of walking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ stars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the workshop is thus increasing the fact that the young participants learn topics like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cultural identity , language , debate , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these questions are inspired by songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in Western Canada , where almost two dozen young women mostly disappeared or murdered .
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of global@@ isation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people are not native to the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the refra@@ in is sung on Cre@@ e .
the young people involved were given some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the Nor@@ th@@ star hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will hear our cry
because as a youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise some@@ day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and go forward as well as our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
in the comments section , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ us ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
plastic dishes ( at the time of the day ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan .

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant .
to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( the way to the &quot; Plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) of any food that is served in this restaurant .
customers can look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter or go on the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the to@@ ki@@ er district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi there are a number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets today .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new mobile tapes decorated with plastic rib@@ bons , as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods have been turned into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex .
in this case an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) turned into a mobile stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition .
and here is an apple that holds your cell phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design .
and that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the com@@ ic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise , for example , colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice .
in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ ards made of dried salmon .
other qu@@ ir@@ ky plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow us on Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually manufactured .
a Mexican project tells stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media on the not@@ orious &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the Mis@@ sing and Get@@ ting regularly appear only in statistics . these , however , do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
the coverage of drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background .
the day after a violent incident , no one looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain .
there are behind each bone , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico has launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how afraid Life Chang@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who seeks secret tom@@ bs every weekend after his son .
Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew on a single day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today to look for the task that we have placed , and to search for graves , according to the people we loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I &apos;m now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me too .
at the moment , she has no income .
you stand for my father &apos;s insurance , but she doesn &apos;t get paid out because they demand a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get these ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t just have to show the faces of those who fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports from journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter in what form it occurs :
I have been acquainted with illness and sensation@@ alism for several years now .
I pass the newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from files of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only thing that is disgu@@ sting or sad . it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body .
I cannot be indiffer@@ ent to it or consider this as normal .
she continues writing :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he &apos;s great . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the in@@ action of people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wat@@ ered up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not stir and are still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : how a family was pl@@ under@@ ed by threats . &quot; in this it describes how armed criminals ex@@ tor@@ ted money from their business month for month until they had destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart .
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain of this never passes , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits have changed , phone numbers too .
we only contact you if it is absolutely necessary .
the further we are from each other , the better .
she concluded her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you .
in these terrible days , I wonder@@ ed whether there would be tears of my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction , he raises questions like : who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells about nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every age .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was over two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as a force through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Civil Security Council and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
just a few stories still live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking which has tor@@ mented the country in the last four decades .
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages to which he links contain pictures depicting violence .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or to expose a fal@@ si@@ fication .
but how is the year after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , no matter if true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its initial release , it has been mis@@ leading to depic@@ t trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for images .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tan@@ ker crossed the village of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ting around and explo@@ ding . 230 people lost their lives .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region became dangerous trails full of po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to navigate .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to it .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball which envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a cinema nearby , which was full of people watching the World Cup .
houses scattered and char@@ ted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to ignorance .
a picture entitled &quot; That is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident depic@@ t the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them .
but here the story does not come to an end .
over the years , the same photo has been raised several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
eye witnesses reported dr@@ astic atro@@ cities to which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many had been sh@@ attered , shot or burned .
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the Nig@@ eri@@ as military and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win the land ( examples of 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrong@@ ly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attri@@ butions ; Africa Check has documented states of Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof for mass kill@@ ings .
one step further , personal comments such as this example mistakenly associate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash announcement , published by the United Nations , those who could flee were beating pun@@ ches , rape and several dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news site , fal@@ sely claiming in 2012 , Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Th@@ ein being said , monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the picture from DR Congo to picture this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations , which called AF@@ P as their source , have also fal@@ sely attributed to Th@@ ein Being this statement , but did not have the picture taken out of the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of this false conn@@ ot@@ ation date back to 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private sites , social media and community as well as national and national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have rel@@ ayed false reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have del@@ ine@@ ated examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use and associated them with the respective countries , on the basis of which page they were published . by this we want to represent the range more clearly than through the language alone .
from the listed countries ( which in some cases were also connected together ) , several examples may be used for impro@@ per use .
here are some cases that can now be fully felt ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods .
the countries in Gra@@ y are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ Eye , may also demonstrate for@@ gery examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .

La Rep@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ ca quotes as his source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
France , 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo in order to illustrate the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have clearly seen no sides such as Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , at that time promoted by a post of U.S. , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller .

Iran , 2012 .
an association of the students of the@@ ology ( mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the picture of the DR Congo .

even inside Nigeria , DR Congo &apos;s photo was broad@@ cast@@ ed as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a tweet expressing sympathy to the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger who pursu@@ es claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government has published a right of correction in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in Myanmar as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliberately fin@@ ed news and photos , the international media , international human rights organizations and governments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ es that use H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and are used by extrem@@ ist groups to demonstrate that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often dis@@ semin@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; arter@@ ios@@ clerosis inj@@ uri@@ osi@@ tive symptoms ? &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , real@@ ises that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the president of Myanmar Th@@ ein had admitted to 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the picture from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture will continue to contain it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article of 2014 about students , who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the recently deleted , Catholic @-@ related news site An@@ Ã¡@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the image is not taken by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ ag@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture was subsequently circul@@ ated in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is attempted to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ DÃ¼n@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world is sleeping ) .
the picture of the DR Congo emerged with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to those events that took place in the name of Islam .
United States , 2015 .
the picture was swe@@ at@@ y for the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times were saved ) , but the messages associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the aim was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( German ) , 2014 .
after a message allegedly auth@@ ored by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; on the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums such as this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a ho@@ ax .
from the embassy in which the picture was taken from the DR Congo , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dist@@ anced themselves .
there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
on other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the map in grey ) Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( dat@@ as@@ ets with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names associated with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared significantly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture may in the end result in a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible .
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media are ei@@ ghty people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this mood of false and false information suggests that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and insul@@ ates the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the spread of violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( here for example ) .
one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is concern that violent images of readers and viewers are des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ zing and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investigated how violent media work on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is the fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .
technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be used by context or in a completely impro@@ per way .
however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ brid@@ geable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world which are difficult or not at all to translate .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific .
some of these inv@@ alu@@ able words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese Saudi ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish Im@@ per@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly any attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word .
these unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while .
most of these lists cover Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
in the blog you can find , for example , words from the Ta@@ p @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - strive for your parents in recognition of how they have tried for you in your younger years .
words in the Hun@@ sr@@ Ã¼ck language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after being war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; insur@@ moun@@ table &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive are these little languages .
speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Languages &quot; that are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite places here .

how Sri Lanka is about to deal with the worst floo@@ d@@ light of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst floo@@ d@@ water and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , usually employing late May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , N@@ il@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missing because of the floods and mud av@@ al@@ an@@ ches .
more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations .
the rainf@@ alls continued on Saturday ( 27 May ) and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still in@@ accessible .
the following images and videos convey an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
flood in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods are wor@@ sen@@ ing the crisis of thought , save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stood in high water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded due to the water p@@ eg@@ els of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force provided five planes for rescue operations and five other five are completed for the transport of emergency supplies for the inhabitants included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups have also agreed to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this area .
the taxi @-@ call @-@ app Pick@@ me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the disaster center is informed .
last year after the catastrophe of the Trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button , allowing users to call a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , with which several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need in security and provide help measures .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality .

use authorized . in January , I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and a dear friend .
I entr@@ ust to her my four @-@ year @-@ old daughter , she confi@@ des in me her children . she is my rock in the sur@@ ge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we call for rights for Trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are located in a sea of umbrellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with a head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , while others are chann@@ elling slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already taken this conversation .
people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination .
they had to pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we all are put into the same Muslim drawer .
in our collective imagination , this drawer is so well constructed that as soon as Muslims do not fit into it as I do not fit into it .
de@@ priv@@ ation of the body
I am not alone .
that even happened to the poet whose poetry is mostly sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western notion , the religion of Rum@@ i was deleted , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry .
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved .
in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid breaks down the story behind these pictures .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ rate them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous ideas dominate our news@@ feeds .
this narrative over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed reality , which in the last three decades had led nine Muslim women to their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative will fail to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
a powerful group exercises its &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who had been brought here by slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has occupied our collective imagination so deeply and flaw@@ ed that often Si@@ kh men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ings .
because of these stories , which we are telling , and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the Nar@@ r@@ ative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims constitute the highest degree &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population is an African @-@ American citizen .
six of ten American Muslims are among the first @-@ generation immigrants origin@@ ating from 77 countries .

four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream .
my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time , when Khan thought out the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were inevitable Muslims and Americans .
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or carrying out my handy hand@@ ker@@ chief , whom all Muslims carry - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ p@@ one W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we don &apos;t carry all hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to combat widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced on the ongoing bond of a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with len@@ ders , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood that have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger that tears a woman in the towel .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim but became a Muslim only then was born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they rever@@ t to the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging .
my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my friend , my neighbour , would see my rock in the sur@@ ge that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter , when I hold her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arab verses to protect the Qur &apos;@@ an and be called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them I repeat three times .
I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see .
my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow .

it is the image of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her perf@@ ected and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which can be almost mem@@ orized .
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I have a bad day .
to be Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people that - for centuries - was col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; empire &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed by a company called Ven@@ erable British East ini@@ dia Company , it has a profound significance to call God my only Lord .

belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry but at the same time see that my beloved grandfather is crying .
in the meantime while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan was un@@ conqu@@ ering about his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , were torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists , who shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; colon@@ ised &quot; all except four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first pilot bom@@ ber of history was thrown off a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , k@@ ash@@ mir under@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dangerous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the newspapers of his time since he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before there were planes , he traveled into more parts of the world than I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
it means knowing that if a tragedy hits the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports in order to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple hy@@ ph@@ ens , but fail to communicate them to others .
the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a magic cube , but is depicted in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons on this branch establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia exists in Muslim registri@@ es , which began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it exists in the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that prec@@ lu@@ des its boundaries towards people from just the countries that bom@@ bard it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the wars that we carry and the bombs that we reject in Muslim countries .
due to the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically in@@ accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we Need To Lead
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are too deeply involved to enth@@ use the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are back decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous pic@@ torial expression that we perpet@@ u@@ ate in our news editorial .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .

but I am concerned about this difficult global point in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason why conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the internet now lead the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
it had not yet been a few years before ; now they are master@@ ing large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history of which I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me a vital Muslim today .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb track in my speech .
things that perhaps evo@@ ke memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where one is made to another .

we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of &quot; others &quot; deliberately and un@@ consciously ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , while he already bom@@ bed cap@@ ut@@ te countries and &quot; other made &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ ative Art aims to preserve urban language diversity
story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniele Rossi , using the CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 license .
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , telling stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the cre@@ ators of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often associated with understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these events are instead &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening to cher@@ ish , feel , touch &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers introduce their story in their own language first and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and presentation will result in the audience getting involved .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video , for example , shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us tells the parable of the rab@@ bit and the Bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe :
after explaining the meaning of his parable , John Ny@@ af@@ ara is asked : &quot; what is it like to talk to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand their language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness :
you &apos;ve listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all who are inspired by the project can come in contact with T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling stories .
Puerto Rico claims new enforcement of sovereign debt
with the objective of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march started at the South African Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da ) and the Com@@ en@@ ical church meeting of Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the new enforcement of the debt also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public debts , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refuse to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with dec@@ lining retirement payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the USA - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization with no party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , proposes a law on state responsibility as an alternative to the existing state view .
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a vast restructuring of the state infrastructure .
measures imposed from outside will be je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed without the participation and convic@@ tions of citizens to be rejected by the people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration bore the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Night guard for light and truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network .

the book published last year and is freely available here contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it reads :
this book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense from our different experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who have been det@@ ained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 .
his name was kn@@ itted from the directory of the A@@ dra jail in which he was sitting on October 3 , 2015 .
since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book , entitled Coll@@ ective Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce , gives his friends and family a voice that wants to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , immediately .
seeing Bass@@ el paying a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose for ?
what have we given up in this process of extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activists has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution .
his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police Bass@@ el &quot; had taken part in a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal in his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria .
Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototype was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the world &apos;s most important archaeological sites , was the cross@@ roads of many civili@@ zations and here Greek @-@ Roman architecture types blend with local traditions and Persian influences .
at that time Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would do everything to extingu@@ ish this architecture , which not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world .
this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
fun@@ n@@ ily , this project has not yet been completed .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
I spent all my life in dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English even when he was in prison .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he has taught other det@@ ain@@ ees to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually holding one in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of waiting ( waiting ) , a sab@@ otage which she wrote to her husband in 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in prison .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for one year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available license @-@ free .

&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your beautiful eyes ,
that I lose the reflection in the moment we embrace ,
that every one of the dangers does not care for me ,
each of the f@@ ences , fet@@ ters and guards
I forget the crow@@ ding of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
which I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I let another piece of my soul leave with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ el@@ iness ,
to bring back all the moments ,
and to cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...

the story of Bas@@ sels is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in jail since 2011 .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambique : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to corruption @-@ convic@@ ted director after release again on previous post &quot; &quot; &quot;
Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption that a government member returned to work in the state machine after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 , along with four other def@@ end@@ ants , of 54 million Me@@ tic@@ al ( about 800 000 Euros ) .
the money came from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambique , whose Council was managing Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his res@@ etting to the company , which happened on 19 April .
in accordance with the opinion of the At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office of the Republic , which evaluated the motion , there would be no reason for any obstacles to relate to Cam@@ ba@@ za , as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment .
however , many inhabitants do not mean the action .
in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the offen@@ ders .
the company apparently kept silent however and did not undertake appropriate legal steps for the use of the corresponding functions .
Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the social media of Moz@@ ambique , re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case &quot; vile . &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had sat down .
he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish up his image .
but since he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ents to be incorporated into the company , which he helped to cause harm .
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
un@@ disgu@@ ised !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil said the director has no moral :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him . I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded with such a way that the state has already so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ ale to return and serve the state , * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but has instead served itself only by the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mah@@ el , that a th@@ ief belongs to prison : &quot; &quot; &quot;
thi@@ eves belong to the Pr@@ ison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to be remembered not only as the first independent president but also as a sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic or@@ ator .
one of his most famous oral presentations was , when he stren@@ u@@ ously affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of all , including fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious person changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is also criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also negative :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment ; he sat down for 10 years and was released .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook blocks the ra@@ cial word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known Social Network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still being discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East In@@ dic@@ ate or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ uses the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or the ad@@ vices &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese Scripture ) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech .
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word have been cens@@ ored for their use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings that have the same sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ kn@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a play .
the phrase ku la - &quot; He@@ aling &quot; + the question mark ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - is very similar to the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the Facebook initiative .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of dis@@ semin@@ ating rac@@ ism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing to Fac@@ t@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the words next to it .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech get a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise her nation@@ alism .
while the campaign may send a strong signal to anyone who dis@@ semin@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , whereby users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts by telling his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is banned from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and the li@@ king , post and sharing of content was prohibited for 24 hours , because the mail &quot; didn &apos;t correspond to the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post , the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism are bad in the country .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice :
Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work .
cens@@ oring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a curr@@ y &quot; have banned .
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied tru@@ sts .
if they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech in order to see if their posts are taken off the network .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which didn &apos;t contain any hate speech , but removed :
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a curr@@ y and watch an Indian film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail containing the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you then heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot used with permission .
in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists , which have used social networks to expand their voices and influence , have increased .
among other things , Hass@@ an in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the commun@@ es in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts forced thousands to flee .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sides .
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context rather than code @-@ concentr@@ ating initiatives and learn from them .
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end of the chil@@ dr@@ ens season
a wedding ring in the sand .

the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the parliament of the country unanim@@ ously approved a law that should forbi@@ d this practice so that the age @-@ worthy age is now at 18 .
before this change of marriage , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities held in practice , and in May 2016 there was a big public scre@@ am . at that time Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ch Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , said that the state should not interfere since that , old age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; not@@ withstanding the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a partner of the UN Convention on Child Rights , the min@@ ors as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every person under 18 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the percentage of children who had been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it was 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office of the country confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 young were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements aimed at aboli@@ shing laws on children &apos;s marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . doub@@ tless they helped bring about this result .
nevertheless , everything went smoothly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the chil@@ dr@@ ens , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this kind of religious opposition resulted in tensions in this un@@ complicated situation , and at some point doubts arise if the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all .
but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite four sen@@ ators ( among them a woman ) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m again :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one against it .
having previously been decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thri@@ lled , because the laws on child marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk disgu@@ ised at the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the chil@@ dr@@ ens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s worth almost every price .
while Abel was of the opinion , it took long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , Excell@@ ent news !
the sp@@ ouses have been decided .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 on the contrary ! ! ! ! &quot;
the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , said :
the age @-@ able age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation eigh@@ teen years .
the draft to am@@ end the sp@@ ouses was decided today , on June 9 , 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all MEPs who opposed the vote have voted for the law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chil@@ dr@@ ens &apos; marriage is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ bearing tur@@ tle .
many thanks to all the activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
thanks to our MEPs .
but a possible hook arises in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the general secretary of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take legal steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to deliver his promise now .
while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished that the debate would be different .
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the debate so generally , if we , instead of addressing the problem , would simply talk about the fact that the state protects our daughters from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men that are in the advantage of them , &quot; would you be willing to continue the discussion ?
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
however , whether it comes to legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where inf@@ ant &apos;s marriage in different gra@@ dations is legal or still the norm , although there are laws which they prohi@@ bit .

mirr@@ oring web pages allows Turkish users to view Wikipedia content
the Wikipedia page was presented internationally in the USA on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking its popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle on Wikipedia .
day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series oppose the block@@ age .
although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world &apos;s third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking an article by Wikipedia , as recently posted in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship from Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked there are now several mirror sites ( pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ plan File System ) , when the platform put all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( i.e. calcul@@ ator computer connections ) , which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
despite the legal ban , the content is irre@@ voc@@ able .
in a blo@@ gger , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we started to stop snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . thus , there is the possibility to read the contents on decentr@@ alized and distributed ways .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it was merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a mirror site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member and co @-@ workers at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
you access another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server further direc@@ ts the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey .

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation
a su@@ h@@ len@@ ose N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and washed colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife to the international stage .
and his hom@@ etown right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class situation helps him in his work :
I live on the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a le@@ op@@ ard .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was on and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
and he ought to know , for he was already standing face to face face to face :
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately sits down , we look at ourselves and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! !
to promote the protection of wild animals Sag@@ ar placed the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos .
his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation .
check out some of these photos below .

this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women should avoid addressing the names of their hus@@ bands or even of older men in the family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should dis@@ regard the norm , keep this practice alive .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a pseu@@ do @-@ judgment and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with a name .
the tradition of not calling their wives by the name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer privileges to fear , if at all they should not follow this practice .
in the small village Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main topic of discussion in the city .
it is a place only for them , in which they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is run by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working with her video camera for seven years using her video camera to detect practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected , and direc@@ ts these clubs .
it tells them how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was of women who don &apos;t call their hus@@ bands on their name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands al@@ oud is a custom that they have perpet@@ ually maintained and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not believe this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion until this discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband on behalf of her husband , wanted to try out how it works .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked everybody , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can tell us how they want , that means they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equivalent ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking a century @-@ old tradition where married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands .
Roh@@ ini tells us :
a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only ch@@ ained before herself ; another decided to release the whole pent @-@ up fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
still in adren@@ alin rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got afraid and said it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic spot on the forehead , indicating the status of the couple :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it either .
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped bearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped doing so , but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves , not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry about who could hear anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last few months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur .
in a round of discussions we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to the clothes .
some women in the group have only borne sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sage cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of trousers ; they did not dare .
after much debate and discussion about the advantages of their own coat @-@ of @-@ clothes , the mor@@ als combined with the sar@@ is and much more , s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled Roh@@ ini sli@@ pped their own pair of kur@@ tas ( tor@@ shirts ) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them .
next they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed .
the question of whether in the five months has already changed since her first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of their husband .
some , including me , do it , but only if they are alone and are not members of the family .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as ha@@ ste for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
as stated in Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am it too .
but this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit to the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commemor@@ ative day
the Beat@@ les at their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot of the Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was held in the hands of the cour@@ a@@ geous to find the Beat@@ les memorial day in the Japanese Twitter Trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is considered a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , re@@ marked in 2016 on the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just barely five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here realized quite quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! today is the Beat@@ les memorial day in Japan .
also today songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese kar@@ aoke bars and in the English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les memorial day is .
we all love the Beat@@ les in our house .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as it is for fans , Japanese people of course also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the well @-@ known places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Math@@ ew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( From the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges sometimes cannot be qu@@ ir@@ ky enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les memorial day is .
exactly today in 1966 the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
and of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; today I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and eat R@@ amen pasta with Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so the day will be gone today .
so , we hope you are there !

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia Police warned the population that bald men could be in Moz@@ ambique &apos;s target of attacks .
photo : different bolt / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0
a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald @-@ headed people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , is disturbing the Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia Police , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government has now called for a number of operations to stop practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently believed that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia said to the BBC .
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of assass@@ ination for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with Al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to go to the country :
attention to bald men travelling to Moz@@ ambique &apos;s bald men in Moz@@ ambique are the target of ritu@@ alistic attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambique Police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three bald men due to their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the assass@@ ination took place .
Hus@@ sel Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ str@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that the local police already follow the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the prosecution and assass@@ ination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has been commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , this draw the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambique in consideration ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that there was a belief that the victims in the head might have power to generate the wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared on Facebook the chron@@ ic@@ le of B@@ log@@ gers &apos;s poor Sn@@ a@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ã@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME fo@@ ams a country in which the people would have shame to go to the streets , and girls would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks , a nation where people would walk hon@@ estly or even take their lives to earn their bread , a land in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald @-@ headed people are hun@@ ted , who aim to get rich wealth .
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunities for flaw@@ less hum@@ our could not be missed .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both are both gl@@ atz@@ kÃ¶@@ p@@ ef@@ ull :
Moz@@ ambique authorities are very concerned about the murder of bald @-@ headed people .

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt sympathy towards his family , friends and all those who have known and loved him .
a pioneer of Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , took Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) to expand public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in Arabic in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who out@@ lay themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband had been condemned to death but did not give any further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and the constitution were unknown until today ( August 1 , 2017 ) when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we especially honor Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organisations who have campaig@@ ned for his release in the last five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2011 and the beginning of the protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , including the Syrian Network for Human Rights organization .
countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly disappeared by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 , no fewer than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably only recently made .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer at the final stage .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man , he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to enable him to treat overseas .
while some countries have critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others have completely wi@@ ped out the subject .
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised some foreign reactions .
United Nations united nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad .
Norway - Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China , since exports were largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately liber@@ ate Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants .
the EU &apos;s top diplom@@ at , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us , as announced in a statement on 30 June :
at the same time , we expect China to lift all limitations of Mr Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family member .
they should meet and receive all visits they wish and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
United States of America
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it could help him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the AF@@ P news agency on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US Embassy sum@@ mon@@ ed a fur@@ ious response from China , with the Foreign Ministry &apos;s statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the following to the couple :
protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condi@@ tionally .
I urge China to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o un@@ condi@@ tionally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany as well as Germany
German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian &quot; solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was released on July 7 and 8 at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing hosted the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ u attorney previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police have always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to anyone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact .
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom to exercise these rights .
France - France
on 29 June , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons :
all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where he needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information if France will finally accept it .
Taiwan Airport , Taiwan
the Council of mainland Europe in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu @-@ M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u , of the ruling demo@@ cra@@ t Progressive Party , also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June by Li@@ u and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world .
I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was supposed to be considered a city .
this re@@ mark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association , the minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supported Singapore as a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of this , it seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently guided by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the topic , the good old ly@@ re emerges from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic as it fits better to their power .
in the end , the answers given in the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam received answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judicial , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he addressed these questions with a rational manner with non @-@ answers .
Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion .
personally , I find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our not@@ e@@ worthy K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , provided he was paid highly to be part of the government of Singapore .
announc@@ ing his commentary on the blog , he points out that he should begin to read the entire address of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was more a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore to cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said Singapore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as the leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that is another matter .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of Singapore &apos;s political leaders , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review de@@ compos@@ es the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; committed a mistake &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city .
since he plays an important role within the Cab@@ inet , statements by Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ?
who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journey of a Dec@@ ade &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tends to affir@@ m , Singapore is and was always a city : &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often listen to statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the defence of the country especially &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked his editors recently : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or home country ?
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ours about certain parts of the world are exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
the question posed to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answered . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I &apos;m living in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his conversation partner by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication often follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans perhaps cook in@@ war@@ dly with rage when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who does not know , there is little that Can@@ adi@@ ans distinguish us from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans attach a Canadian flag to their ru@@ cksack when they travel .
everyone loves Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans , on the other hand ... .
so it was already when I began travelling through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
gay marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we obviously often say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
first of all , I have many American friends whom I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if I &apos;d be confused with Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first : to be called &quot; nice , &quot; basically means to be idle - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , soft but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian double @-@ go@@ er ) .
if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter .
to be harmless is to be in@@ con@@ spic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far from the things that happen around you .
I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of the Canadian .
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what out@@ si@@ ders describe as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans often don &apos;t talk about the fence across the fence .
we lack the warm , open friendliness , which I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; cute . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dy Thailand &apos;s j@@ un@@ ta
a pop band famous in Thailand has released a music video that the j@@ un@@ ta par@@ o@@ ols , which took power in 2014 and despite their promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about the rules he makes his girlfriend .
although not explicitly politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continued military rule of the j@@ un@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
in the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was divided 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially how it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta regime .
take a look at these videos of videos that relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which grants absolute discretion to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army on important national issues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change in settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the j@@ un@@ ta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army which monitors online content and accused persons accused of le@@ ver@@ aging the monarchy .
Thailand uses a strict har@@ sh@@ ment against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems that the j@@ un@@ ta continues to pursue is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines even though security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax pay@@ ers .
the video shows how people are thrown into a black delivery van before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some journalists are in jail , because they allegedly caused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; confusion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long imprisonment , should they insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song showed members of the band that im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost towns in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ asia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Geor@@ gian war officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ i are located in the basin of Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
different ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Dep@@ end@@ ants , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , the largest part of Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey residential blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ kow@@ kas , symboli@@ se the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are dec@@ ayed and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to end this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that all served the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
about fifty inhabitants live in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still harbour one or two families , are recognized by the balconies , where linen is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed home .
when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she just forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal use ) such as livestock breeding , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to get over the l@@ aps .
in winter the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages .

about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my heart will remain in Asia for ever , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to receive financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building .
when holidays are , we visit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but we cannot do this all the time - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she calls A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
everyday she re@@ members the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia just broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( Administr@@ ative Capital in Ab@@ ch@@ asia ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha holds about $ 9 for each child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
near the house where there has been Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once , they keep pigs , cows , ste@@ els and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that at first it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxi@@ ousness .

you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right for them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when our conversation tends to end , a little boy is running to us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hi@@ des .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
as they walk , some of them throw stones on the exp@@ elled buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez runs a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner P@@ RI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border with Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
it is led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican singer , a young woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in Ted@@ dy B@@ ears .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name of Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless , hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants are arriving here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez re@@ counts , the people are coming in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m Africa ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes .
she does not want to refuse anyone .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medication they can &apos;t afford , she mas@@ sively mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived recently .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a reasonable nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebas@@ ti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to come to Boston to find her husband and three children .
they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that Afri@@ cans already speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
like many of his companions , he previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest at M@@ um Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , smiling . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her that her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I experienced what they are experiencing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others don &apos;t help . that &apos;s why I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job site .
the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children , who wanted to squee@@ ze money from him without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single teacher , offered him their roof .
a few months later the family is still living there and she tries to decide where to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa , everything is full of guests .
in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , the travellers quietly consult their phones .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she &apos;s also nostal@@ gic because of those who went away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she fli@@ ps in her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair lichen that her has made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many more travelers , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she pre@@ fers her .
&quot; Ya I fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; they have gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users .
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile phone call to install the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the message it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities also managed to use the app for more than fighting terrorism .
according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because , just after they had installed the app , they exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group .
the police report found that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online sc@@ ams , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users about how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network .
this app with filtering for min@@ ors is meant to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person .
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
while messages about digital cens@@ orship in China are mostly focused on users &apos; experiences in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , repres@@ sed ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shut@@ downs .
the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; which cens@@ ored messages posted in China showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen picked up the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app .
the X@@ inj@@ ian authorities make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , it could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
you have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity by the recovery technology .
we are back in Mao &apos;s China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description from which it comes out that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions given by the City Party Council to minimize dis@@ semination of illegal content . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all government branches , public authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices .
a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :
in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi to register their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at the local police .
the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible off@@ ence , including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications .
sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Du@@ b@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and realize that you are all alone in a place where everything is important .
everything gradually dis@@ b@@ anded and revealed a truth that is clearly visible both from the inside and from the outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one that gives honour to her name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one who has kno@@ cked down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but if reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond drama , beautiful scenes and performers - the characters are transformed into beings from flesh and blood , and everything scre@@ ams after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the Earth is spinning on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone .
they have arrested me and my father three times , but this was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were ri@@ pped in a peaceful protest like we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was enough for the city to cr@@ ush the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the neighbor@@ hoods swe@@ pt away , just my own .
for the first time it was silent , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that has been obstruc@@ ted to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down a little after the electricity supply stopped functioning in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by the silence .
a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we alli@@ ed ourselves to a splendid image that fully fulfilled my expectations .
in such a moment , you are aware that you release the gh@@ ost from the lamp , but it simply does not interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he put on .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you back your voice after you cried out to you all the way up to the security service office .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me also hear you scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only cour@@ a@@ geous enough to sh@@ out if we are not close . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes focused on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you dare to see me in your eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building .
perhaps it was my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure of my cause when I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hadn &apos;t thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement with his father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father like that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed dance is still in my nose today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I scre@@ amed the yard .
in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me .
then back through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I pre@@ tend all details exactly before I enter the room .
in other words , they have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I can immediately set up without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell , and I attacked a tried and tested method of communication : to strike against the wall with his fist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I learned that my cell com@@ rade was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first chief &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness no distinctive tra@@ its can be seen , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will be inter@@ ro@@ gated immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him if I stay .
li@@ ar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive all these crow@@ s that are lab@@ oring on the fruits in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from a distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams sound , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the color of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that showed us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under &quot; , all@@ usion to 13th Sh@@ ure of the Quran ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be inter@@ ro@@ gated . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was v@@ ented : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ t dialect - so they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the close view of their world view .
this is not a house that is not a country here ; it is a curse which they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and stock@@ y man ; at least he seems to me so .
he begins a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that der@@ ail him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start as much more important with your life than joining those thu@@ gs and prot@@ esting demonstrations that will soon be an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I &apos;m used to not answering .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and strikes have become an ordinary communication tool after a friendly conversation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , although I had done nothing to deserve this punishment .
on punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; con@@ fession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably comes from the clo@@ ist@@ ers .
your exec@@ ution@@ er will delight in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot compete with him and you can &apos;t hold back your cri@@ es .
my scre@@ ams didn &apos;t like him yet enough so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector or whether it belonged to normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a huge cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the row .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and did not find a favour , which is why he attacked an electrically loaded stick next to him .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body enough to supply my whole neighborhood .
my half @-@ naked body stretched out on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted you@@ ths : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be quiet and move , you will be mis@@ placed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he locks to his screen , sometimes to his computer , hin and again to his couch .
but what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fel@@ lows ( about : farmers ) .
for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questions their old @-@ proven opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ sion@@ ism .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking , and he can feel loud with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special dis@@ like against the American foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , has anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian escap@@ ees of the second generation &quot; - so he refers to himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think so because of my own circumstances , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think so , because I am a human being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while he po@@ urs into two cups in water . it &apos;s the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a burning hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the lu@@ gs speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ ist@@ band of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison .
recently , the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ os@@ exual front @-@ singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ ai , contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms , is the main reason for the concert statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the MEPs and former press spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ ri@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the established legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement should probably not be just rhet@@ oric , but actually reflect an increasingly obvious reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender norms to body by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
she is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who they should trust .
in the past few years , the number of &quot; honorary mor@@ als &quot; has been increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside is foreg@@ one .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers reached its zen@@ ith in 2016 ; however , it is compo@@ unded that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence .
according to a law on crime against crime in 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; in@@ definitely be det@@ ained in prison &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that the woman will have nothing to do .
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s music also enjoys great popularity and is well known for not shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b dispute that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was informed of politics , &quot; he says .
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b att@@ acking the question of the Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song called &quot; Sant@@ or@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of ga@@ ys and les@@ bians and that comments on equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been extensively cens@@ ored in 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b introduced an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to remember that his comments were torn out of context , distorted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a edited version was stre@@ amed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the eighth century , who remains in memory even today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ evo , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
there is nothing new in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom that the government sanc@@ tion attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service seized several former members of the government and members of the teacher association with the reason that they cri@@ tically expressed themselves on comments in social media related to the corruption rooted in the deeply rooted corruption of the country .
in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural re@@ thinking in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now prevented M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - that is H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing them . &quot;
perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions , and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies .
until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and consequently resist .

Neb@@ ula in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ ula Festival .
one susp@@ ects that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us in August . another theory states that the fort@@ resses , drums and dancing have been handed over more than one thousand years ago and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the Nor@@ theast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the em@@ iss@@ us@@ hi , to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view .
one can only imagine how big these parts are ...
a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ ula Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high fortress was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ ans exchange arms against sh@@ ears and raz@@ ors

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Call@@ ao , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are everyday .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for es@@ thetic services for men .
the trend , appearance and therefore also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to more and more regular citizens to go to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these expensive hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 .
there experts are competing against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the Augu@@ sto Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy school , located in El Call@@ ao , found an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to trade their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the school year that began in March and reported on some of its achievements :
in 1995 , we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district , which we are very proud of , because we have built up this education community because of love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ ri@@ llas
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love letters to people we know ?
is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel exp@@ elled ?
exactly this question left the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga of the Bo@@ got@@ art Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cart@@ as p@@ or la leg@@ li@@ aci@@ Ã³n , which encouraged young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ llas .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) that forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who had lived in illegal refugee camps for many years , were exposed to a rhet@@ oric of war and were carrying their weapons around the clock , must now integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , once accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla struggles , must now take up its ranks and support them in building a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must unite and help in the process of integration .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ llas back in order to welcome them back into society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who will then be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as an inspiration for the campaign
the idea for the letters to reconciliation was based on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates who took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to briefly speak to K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ th@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need much more .
he plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year .
so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
so far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ ic@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
a group of 40 students from the University Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ art Foundation traveled to the camp to personally convey the letters .
the F@@ ARC members stood up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; said the political student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the guer@@ ri@@ llas lived ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , I asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
perhaps he was tired of the war , it was sad to be the faithful companion of this warri@@ or for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he never expected something different from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms .
until now , I only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace reig@@ ns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices in new voices
at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together for a discussion .
the students were all grown up and the F@@ ARC was already in hiding .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC said the history of the organization , their ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have witnessed the social injustice of the state to the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party , we can help shape society more just in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and realizing that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings , who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful to me .
the reality in which the country lives is hur@@ ting .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who killed and caused so much harm , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g .
many former fighters have replied to the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i :
the Colom@@ bians were proph@@ esi@@ ed that peace would reign after dis@@ arm@@ ament .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , rise up and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call all supporters of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and offer sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .
a Trans@@ woman talks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ rov

it follows the translation of an article written by our partner Ai@@ da Mir@@ mak@@ h@@ ova and whose first publication took place on the website of OC Media .
hom@@ os@@ exual and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of haz@@ ards - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with horror , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last few months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat posed like a sword sword about the local LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community has not only come about overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked to us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has taken over the international head@@ lines several months ago after reports have been published that addressed the deport@@ ation , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ as@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Ch@@ echn@@ ya authorities who arrested suspi@@ cious men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in gun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they brought a monster to the world &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there .
she already felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned from the gender equ@@ ation of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
she moved to the USA for fear of her life .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman clothed in difficulty .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while trying to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the Internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can remove this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos from my documents went through the W@@ hat@@ s@@ App round .
on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked .
when I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from my car &apos;s back seat , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot;
when I turned around , I felt a bit in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ or the family , you Sch@@ and@@ fl@@ eck ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and woke up at the end of the hospital .
apparently some women had received everything and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital , I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung .
OC Media : in which wing were you placed - in which the men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are out of date , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women .
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
when I first read his name at his office , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for having res@@ or@@ ted to me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
they called me and wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
they asked me to send back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all this was a lie .
they put absurd demands : some said to me that I must prove it by running through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that all was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop .
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family manage to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has humili@@ ated not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was too much for my mother and she put a rope around his neck .
fortunately the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark windows under the window and a number plate with a 95 on it .
after it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something wrong .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
without registration , I bought it without registration , without registration .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked in at the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;d be safe just because you left the country ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you get stuck . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
but we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
some traditionally Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still carry in me .
as much as I wish , this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I really trouble watching the person they remember from their past - so to my male form .
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed dor@@ man@@ t ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in a gun for one and a half months .
he told that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that everyone could barely wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not exclude a new wave .
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
this is what I mean , they probably charge the relatives , they take care of the problem with the person concerned , and in the end we demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; is experienced by the blood of satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men now still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there &apos;s not so many .
if , then , above all , those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to execute Gaddafi &apos;s court .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked some village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise themselves .
OC Media : is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was det@@ ained in gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself when these people were taken along .
until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports to date . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always been wearing my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny , when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , back then it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vili@@ zation &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in the end it was thrown back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short loops .
the Ministry of Security of Sh@@ aria has never bent a hair on me .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there .
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t worry about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one often says it to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never offen@@ ded me , never hun@@ ted and never struck .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace last ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began speaking on television about morality .
he spoke not about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women .
nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city started to change .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at once with suspicion .
in that time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteri@@ or@@ ated .
OC Media : what kind of activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA .
apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organise te@@ ac@@ ups , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food menus .
I don &apos;t spend a cent for it .
I discovered these people myself when I stum@@ bled away places of refuge .
I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ off ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to expose you to foam in front of the mouth that there are no ga@@ ols .
the Da@@ ge@@ stan@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians have whatever ; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I come from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant for me to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during the Ram@@ adan - live with men .
you know , many think at tran@@ sit@@ ty to men who love men , and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact , different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all , because I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
there has been a sharp rise in suicide since the last few months .
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 moved the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran which is marked by poverty and unemployment .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the southwest of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability of his family to arise , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and wish to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August in the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Tam@@ im - have imposed .
their stories have one thing in common : it was all family pat@@ rons who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government , and to pursue a safe work .
Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to cont@@ end its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab ancest@@ or was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 underwent major efforts to end ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most productive and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population receives only little of this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arabic regions in the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are lying .
these dam@@ s have only managed to ag@@ grav@@ ate the des@@ ol@@ ation caused by d@@ rought , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ si young@@ sters increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , announced that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school and 45 % completed a university degree .
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , a human rights activ@@ ist who resi@@ des in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging in Ah@@ ra@@ z and anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot; &quot; &quot;
since officials and institutions do not pre@@ tend to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and for@@ cing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ ra@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated , let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing .
in view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi have to endure , human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation becomes explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and becoming aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and originally published on the A@@ fro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women , who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and soci@@ etal arguments in front of me , why I should be femin@@ ist and why we should generally be femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , nowadays , despite the same education , women still earn less money than men .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I suffer double and triple .
I am a black woman .
and yet : when I come to speak on skin colour , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention the way we have always been mis@@ used in terms of ra@@ cial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white fem@@ inists adopted not to mention women .
but they all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of ra@@ ci@@ ally motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I can &apos;t join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injus@@ tices in her thinking that relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ n compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I , too , refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an evil and margin@@ alised being in an historical sense .
I refuse to join groups that , in addition , absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation in order to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c programme .
I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender , as some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; still exists in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and to join the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than engaging me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever before that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , author of Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , corpor@@ al and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you to inform themselves about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of the femin@@ ist movement of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift up black women and women of other cultures , because in this paradig@@ m I exist .
because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman , I am recognized as part of this paradig@@ m .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on international efforts to solve environmental problems .
in the context of a content sharing agreement , this article will be re@@ published here .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission is to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentary by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .

Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence
&quot; &quot; &quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the crying women &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express their pain on women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and show their rejection . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ sory . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ter@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed for the protection of the persons affected .
a police inspec@@ tor told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent over her .
since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said their statement would be laid on the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena about ill @-@ treatment , there was no use of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez &apos; attention to detail .
a few days later , the second woman drew back her advertisement .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
if women report a complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the state .
in many cases , women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to law enforcement agencies at all .
In@@ halt@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible ab@@ uses and a legal system that contains nothing under Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation impacts and statistics
it is hard to find out how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher in gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aci@@ Ã³n y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are different reports and reports that do not even reveal the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; she explains .
however , the numbers available are alar@@ ming .
in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office included 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of the advertisements of women came here .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were mi@@ stre@@ ated physically , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do so . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on any woman who is ref@@ unded for bodily abuse , there are two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own off@@ ence , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
by August 2016 alone , journalists included at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country .
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men .

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that nothing under@@ takes
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
in the beginning she did not want to do that , but then she did . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted forever .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she has endu@@ red the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I read about it , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent , because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing her name , she wrote posts on Facebook , where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him sooner .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ating them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) consisting of women who are all in any way victims of abuse . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case , everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
Victoria advertisements with the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support .
she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays &apos; laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the display of abuse is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees major problems in the application of the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 a draft law was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees that fem@@ ini@@ d is an independent crime book and pun@@ ish@@ able to punish har@@ sh@@ er as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the wording of the law was changed in a few ways in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions would be lev@@ elled , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had fores@@ een that the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence have to carry on themselves , if they simply res@@ ti@@ tu@@ te ad and would like to receive a secure accommodation , to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it :
in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal .
those who are silent in the face of these facts acqu@@ ires themselves and contributes to the fact that the perpet@@ rators are free to off@@ end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to refund so long before abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . prior to that , parts of the law had been modified . among other things , a passage was cancelled , which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence .
opinions about the changes are going apart .
the reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law , however , is considered a great set@@ back .

independent media in Oman a year after the ban on a newspaper continues to be attacked
&quot; this website was closed on the basis of a resolution by the Minister of Information &quot; published on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n .
more than a year ago , the Ot@@ toman authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of its reporting of corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison where he is serving a one @-@ year prison term .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and tried , but later released .
Oman has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after having settled his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; Ã©@@ tat .
since then , alongside his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has prof@@ essed the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic intelligence , to restrict public fre@@ edoms , including freedom of the press , to torture and in@@ timi@@ date human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict the peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 entitled &quot; The hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
in this report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman , to susp@@ end a verdict in an inheritance case .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the title : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial board , was invited by the ISS before the special department and arrested by the security forces upon arrival .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS took up deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as Chief Editor to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information issued the statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , is prohibited from 9 August 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the trial in Mas@@ k@@ at took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , to &quot; distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; mis@@ use of the internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a publication ban and slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years &apos; imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 Nep@@ al@@ ese Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year ban on employment was imposed on both journalists .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order .
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ ani@@ ties ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the pron@@ ounc@@ ement of the sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on 26 December 2016 , but al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after a six @-@ month prison sentence from the Mas@@ k@@ at prison . al @-@ Ha@@ j remains in prison where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government of the Roman@@ sh government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; by three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of the press was injured in recent times in Oman .
further violations include , for example , closing the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the Afgh@@ an authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ bian authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that its journalists can pursue their work ;
3 . protect the freedom of the press in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial exec@@ utions .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit , non @-@ governmental organization supporting human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting freedom of expression and association and the right to assemble , support and protect them peac@@ efully .

medical research in Africa : chances and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more severe effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem .
secondly , research carried out by African scientists is helping build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Center for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) .
in the 1990s he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just when the AIDS epide@@ mic first showed serious effects on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a Post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ Ã¡@@ mi healthcare system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results . in doing so , I support the Serbian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
I am also currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
CC : what do you think are the key current scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always be receivers instead of being power themselves .
the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GM : where does funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or withdraw here , as funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
GM : what is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is need for special academic education , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , space exploration , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries , based on your experience ?
RW : often it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines are only available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers are changing food production worldwide
this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com webpage , a magazine that talks about solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ ra@@ geous , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by his own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many types of let@@ tu@@ ce he can get .
but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it any further for breeding .
the patents are not only for single varieties , but also for certain properties , such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green , or cr@@ inkl@@ ed leaves .
over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or card@@ boards . due to this trend , plant bree@@ ders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still breeding let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer as his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der to which I have to p@@ addle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when they stand trial , no one can breed a new type of salad because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot; so he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants .
however , he is very cau@@ tious and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tube salad of the Out@@ red@@ ante grade in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested if plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free open source software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property so that plant bree@@ ders can be used permanently .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US bree@@ ders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them .
this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; bree@@ ders only allow others to breed their seeds so as to breed their own varieties , and not to cut it out immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of bree@@ ders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
for the emer@@ itus professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of seed and the ability to breed new plants , both for food security and environmental protection .
seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bree@@ ders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; movement does not concern itself with genetically modified plants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from organic farming or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , &quot; he says and particip@@ ates in the ever increasing mer@@ gers in the global agriculture industry , the latest examples of the mer@@ ging of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , as it is offered , for example , on farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to continue to provide their seeds to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant features .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available genetic pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the ever @-@ increasing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore increasingly restricted .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found that about one third of all the anti@@ trust characteristics are protected as intellectual property , which makes it impossible for plant bree@@ ders to be used either at all or even more difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not yet exist , but experts such as Lu@@ by assume that mass @-@ grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots .
a question of perspective
plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specifically desirable characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves until such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bree@@ ders takes more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson Car@@ ly S@@ ca@@ du@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions like the United States agricultural ministry , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity .
however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is other bree@@ ders , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expi@@ red .
often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but supports it by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees it differently : waiting for 20 years until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , you would have lost the fight .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain : &quot; independent plant bree@@ ders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to facilitate farmers their work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant features : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form it themselves and as bree@@ ders , we finally have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ eche , plant bree@@ der in the U.S. state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i &apos;s board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures are needed for the cultivation of a mass of her@@ bi@@ cides , which is breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is just opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case .

Mor@@ ton is also convinced that bree@@ ders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I always need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , it is protected against competition for 20 years , which makes it very easy in my opinion . &quot;
although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding , the concept now spreads quickly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ e is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bree@@ ders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding differ from country to country , which is why the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally cultivated plants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2016 , the Dutch organisation Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seed .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for Open Source seed systems , explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems for which the official launch should be scheduled next year .
a merger of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food , has published a network of aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . in this , it represents the view that farmers have the opportunity to come to seed , exchange and improve seed policy in order to ensure a stable supply of food .
the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has particularly focused on where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
on the weekend of the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , docum@@ enting human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported it above .
in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world in spite of this attack and the mo@@ ck@@ ery of the Egyptian right and the constitution . even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it was never as important as now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the distortion and not dimin@@ ish . we ins@@ ist on fulfilling our task further .
AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ ur , the Arab @-@ language edition of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al J@@ az@@ e@@ era due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;

in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no more access to Egypt .
Zi@@ ada uses his blog for the distribution of columns and articles , which he writes for websites and media not available in Egypt .
now the blog he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government was himself the target of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider of the also ci@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles are mainly revol@@ ving around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada spoke about the government &apos;s block@@ age and reflected what it means for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons :
1 ) They succeeded in im@@ par@@ ting me the feeling of a state of siege ; a arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons to the National Security Council , the blocking blo@@ gs and any other web site I worked for .
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words : my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles in order to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog .
the cour@@ a@@ geous will go the way up to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked the web from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and ET@@ IS@@ A@@ LA@@ T .
af@@ te also documented the block@@ age of providers that was possible through the circum@@ vention of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the blocking of web pages that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practices imp@@ ly the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that might have access to Egyptian users .
the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are taken behind closed doors , so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against these actions in court .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
the Brazilian armed forces deployed in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the government crisis .

day after day , newspapers in the whole of Brazil are reporting state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves ro@@ b pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends out 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
in the middle of the economic crisis and in a stra@@ ined financial situation , the violence threshold in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio .
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation , Global Justice , even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published on 16 August published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; That &apos;s not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in which she announced to set up a new column called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the paper thus explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world , such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . , which , however , devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : it &apos;s not normal !
this is the only alternative so as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ ede , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
in the same video , a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war dis@@ course , if it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police who are shooting and then asking questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not civilians , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira is argu@@ ing against violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police .
this is not a war .
this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ acceptable negl@@ ect of the public service .
to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital .

according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is considered to be &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north @-@ east of the country .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the mor@@ row &apos;s per state , Rio is ranked 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is part of Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia stresses , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these security policy measures included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police camp and permanently station@@ ing a unit there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases . but , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under attack after several reports of har@@ ass@@ ment and repres@@ sions against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux rec@@ ited from one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio is not the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio will also result in serious consequences for human beings .
this calls on the state to use means and means that are typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an invisible point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Rio will continue to suffer .
it is a week ago that the police declare the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence , this incident happened as head@@ lines : an or@@ ch@@ ard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : learn besieg@@ ed Syri@@ ans , plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ c
since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the ensu@@ ing civil war many Syrian cities suffer from a brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b .
the region East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians to live .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime .
since 2013 , these rebel areas have been besieg@@ ed by rebel areas outside Damascus , which led to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; food @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and run the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , told the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and to make it easier for more and more to gain popularity . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
125 families are planning to bro@@ aden the plant@@ ation of mushrooms , Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the Constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around â¬ 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday 4th September 2017 .
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy .
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started the &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds from the regions &quot; before they checked out their quality and , if they are suitable for consumption .
then they planted a small mushroom @-@ yard in a tank . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after 3 months , mushrooms have been distributed throughout Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a for free .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
provision of a new food source in the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the production of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world , so that our success and our fight against hunger and siege becomes visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese call for justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities in Portugal on October 21 and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were ra@@ mp@@ ant in the north of Portugal .
forty @-@ two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the fact that the government cried out for three days in solidarity with the victims for three days .
bran@@ dies were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 explo@@ sions of fire that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017 , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness : there are only in 4 districts no fire .
quite Portugal is burning in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a d ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15th , 2017

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ Ã£o So@@ ver@@ al , Portugal &apos;s Con@@ federation , declared P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , construction permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a far reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments .
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law allowing the construction activity from fall to fall , if the applicant had a means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val continues in the same article of the paper P@@ Ãº@@ bli@@ co .
the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees of easily inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , still expand upon fires of this kind .
these problems are due to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when inhabitants were looking for information or trying to contact their relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that provided information to the population : it took advantage of its own civil protection data with the help of the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial at this fat@@ eful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million visitors .

in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years earlier , a terrible civil war between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n fac@@ tions broke out , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of the Haz@@ ara , sat in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even if his mother did not say that at that time , she knew she wouldn &apos;t see her son for a long time - maybe even more .
at dawn , the boy was supposed to break open .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Haz@@ ara @-@ dominated He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ reb@@ ate party , had just been killed by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ k found himself in Pakistan .
he worked in a coal mine for a few years . the work was heavy and made him ill .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar which were heavier than himself , to earn his livel@@ ihood .
back then , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really tough , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ k in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were no services and no heating there . we hang@@ ed nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ k left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and landed on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece .
after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k joined Italy in 2002 .
some time A@@ shar@@ k was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; true , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers due to relatively high willingness to pay . however , it is true that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the human rights organization Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special admission centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; they are impro@@ vised centres in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which may result after the registration of the asylum application for months .
until then people who have no money for accommodation depend either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
and there was also A@@ shar@@ k .
but his unt@@ amed li@@ fest@@ y@@ les helped A@@ shar@@ k to get rid of these conditions soon .
after having worked several years in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ k put his whole savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice .
this was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack .
A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis &quot; success story is now the topic of &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have ar@@ isen , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Orient Experience restaurant , where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pa@@ dua the peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
however , A@@ shar@@ a &apos;s goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy sector and retail , and aim to return to the country which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ k with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan .
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and must get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ shar@@ k also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can sell their crop surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the development towards a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity .
A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .
N@@ eti@@ zen Report : Egypt &apos;s draft bill enables shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in detention for more than 900 days .
he reported on the clearance of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , prot@@ esting against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys N@@ eti@@ zen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges , wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights
the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that suggests that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority .
users should register to use social networks within six months of their successful legislative decision on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name and ID number .
those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months &quot; imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty .
the law , which was applied by sixty Members of Parliament , is currently present to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
in May , another member of the Bundestag reached a legislative proposal that would introduce heavier pun@@ ish@@ ments to the insul@@ t of the president or a high official .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under Egyptian law , the en@@ vy of the president as well as state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under the legislative act , such action would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judicial experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; imprisonment &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years .
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who shot Egyptian polic@@ emen while exercising violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the pres@@ election of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in jail for a trial date , just as more than 700 protest participants had been arrested for the same incident .
his trial , which was scheduled for 20 May , was recently postpon@@ ed because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatening the death penalty on the basis of one , so many human rights groups agree , bo@@ g@@ us burden of , among other things , arms ownership , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a spoke to the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si sitting block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the pun@@ ish@@ ments of the journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested for the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tunisi@@ an activists questioned about le@@ aked documents
in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours listening to Sam@@ i Ben G@@ res@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ res@@ bia was mainly inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan , explicitly supported a controversial bill that would acc@@ use business@@ men and during the former regime of dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption if they return all illeg@@ ally received funds .
the document , published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website , sheds light on how the presidential plans for the support of the draft bill look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the mention of his sources under the name of Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the Regional Court in Tunis on 9 May .
does China want to force users of social media to submit their identification ?
according to new rules of the information bure@@ au of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media .
it is also stated in the regulations that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts assume that here@@ with the elimination of anonymous comments is to be achieved in social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Ros@@ com@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; organizer of the dis@@ semination of information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this designation is part of a year of 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government is carrying out a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force them upon request to susp@@ end user data .
websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ n@@ ull@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the image board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ R@@ u and dozens of other services belong to these websites .
Turkish court features ban Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the ban on Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site had been closed because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an information resource that co@@ operates with groups to address a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey blocked the website completely . it is , among other things , China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
UK can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ing
after this week of le@@ aked documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor real @-@ time communications and to install Backdoor uting programs that dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left out other technology companies and the civilian population outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and proposals from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
