<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run their sports.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">At the age of 14 I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts as the Jura-student, covered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "free to Method Man," "" "I was as if it is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona was only intensifying my admiration for the USA.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said: "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then came Donald Trump.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about this man's xenophobia and racism.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in droves for him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">Like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer person with whom I could converse about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Trumps's worldview coincided with Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer.</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who struggles for her life for the sake of the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits to the engagement of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Leaks, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump cleared his way to the nominated republican presidential candidates, they offered me a halt and the counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, presidency made a man despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for dump because they shared either its racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and incapable of understanding those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for dump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, they might say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps. perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, you can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "this" "" "Whitelash" "" "(note): as much as" "" "revolving the whites against all other ethnicities" "", "the white and whiplash word play, as the great van Jones called, has killed just what America has done so splendidly." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - what faith or background one may have, America welcomes everyone.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president twice the son of a Kenyan man, whose story, as he says himself, would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">With the election of Donald Trumps, however, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to Hell with diversity, religious freedom and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of his election.</seg>
<seg id="47">On a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "the crowd responded with a loud" "" "no!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "" "" "no!" "" "they cried and their voices louder." ""</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone is not like you, have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "" "thank God, Mr. Trump, that's not your America." "" "36 hours later he was corrected." ""</seg>
<seg id="59">The land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps country, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people who look like Mr. Khan, couldn't find a place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What does the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca province have in common with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateurah?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both places has not only changed the lives of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is at the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">For several years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music band) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which, with their musical instruments, has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding it.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest in Vicente Guerrero's community in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of Mexico's poorest provinces, is known for its abuse and gang violence.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare glimmer of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they get out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day, trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from litter</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing - a village located at the top of the biggest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with prepared instruments consisting of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers started turning parts of waste into instruments under the guidance of Favio ChÃ¡vez.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments mimic violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all produced from the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article by the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">At first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the kids knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin made of rubbish.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments made of recycled material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of trash every year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - as the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music all around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat IUU fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published by Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports on international, practised solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content together.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already had illegal fishing in the waters of Liberia, before the other coast of Africa visited.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were correspondingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind on their shores.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized themselves against the ship. they refused to stop one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing permit.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply denied everything," "" "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and pursued the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">In the end, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of looting the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, founded in 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (illegal fishing).</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network, along with Somalia and Madagascar, are the six countries that at that time had expelled the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and help each other where illegal fishing is concerned," "" "says Tony Long, Head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, and therefore it is extremely difficult to detect.</seg>
<seg id="110">By the deliberate contempt of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing can harm ecosystems which have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once impeded by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the auger stamp, with which information was circulated between individual countries, the actions are happening in real time, with traceability at FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">For example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that have been noticed or experienced during a port inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea using satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. even so suspicious routes can be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship discharges its caught fish on the road to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the road and possibly also whether they have a criminal liability.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information, which means that the ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "it is about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially unprofitable." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">"" "and this is what we want to achieve," "" "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm advocating the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supporting FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front door</seg>
<seg id="120">The aforementioned platform has been created to recover an estimated 20 million USD of lost revenues, which lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year because of the illegal fishermen who enter East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region attracts commercial fishing from around the world. among these illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, fantasy names, fishing protected species and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they exploit the lack of international co-operation and make use of the weaknesses of an uninterrupted organized control system," "" "says Long." "" "in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You mustn't run my harbor" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "yet another country could say" "" "Come to me." "" "and just this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">Until now, the closed front function works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspect vessels.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international body to combat crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "" "" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that helps FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly evolving, also helps to detect the illegal ships that love to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, Chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and provides technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that connects different levels of information. it is designed to help FISH-i find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations really influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes it.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently, SkyTruth launched the Global Fishing Watch platform alongside Google and Marine Protection Organization Oceana: a platform that provides satellite data and can be viewed anywhere in the world by means of the position of each single tracking ship.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors, to get a better picture of who is doing what is doing - that simply makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and join their resources for investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this at a global level." "" "" "" "ew charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows tracking of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities not only detest criminals but also scare them off.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that previously had no license and could hardly reckon with consequences now know they are being observed.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i are seeing a 33% increase in fisheries sales since fishing boats have purchased more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i had helped Somalia to track Greko 1, the inspectors found towing nets on board where they were banned.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "said Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="148">"" "six countries joined forces in 2015, the West Africa Task Force. they are now tackling illegal fishing according to exactly the same model as FISH-i." "" "Safety is the aim of bringing even more such initiatives and structures into other regions," "" "says Copeland." ""</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to report its first major triumph: in October it presented Greko 1, a ship under a false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without license and were used towing nets that are now prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="150">"" "the ship had also penetrated into forbidden waters, reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "" "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London.</seg>

<seg id="153">Street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are regarded as a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the impeachment of President NicolÃ¡s Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela opposed the proposal of the opposition to a referendum on impeachment, the Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations about the country's political and economic crisis, ran into emptiness by gathering on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hash tag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (for example: the refund of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate will also be held in other parts of the country - among others in the flat-land area of Barinas, in the Andes regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the centrally located north-west of the village of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The country's political and economic situation worsens continuously, which is reflected in the daily life of Venezuelans by an acute lack of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the impeachment of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but in the end the holding of a re-election was blocked by official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the Context of the Governance Code as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">In the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and violence are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which there is a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine, the referendum was considered the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance, Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica, or short MUD (for example: round Table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together called on the demonstrators to join a mass rally to support the National Assembly. in addition, a twelve-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, were scheduled to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The call was commented on Twitter, among other things, as follows:</seg>

<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to watch the atrocities in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">As an adult man Quijano now said to his father as part of the big La Perla-Ribera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="201">During the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano has not chosen his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I thought it was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years, one does not realize that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, a torturer and a murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Secret Service Department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>

<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijjanos's son, a man who, over the years, recognized the scale of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy, and who testified before a Federal Constitutional Court against his own father.</seg>

<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall with us. there I had befriended a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you were friends with one of the ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they don't deceive you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Workers Party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">That's why he forbade me to go to the sports hall again. a few days later he took me to work at the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought it was fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">On the military base I had to destroy the papers that had heard the prisoner.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all kinds of documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, just everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla - all in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">The first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack where cars, furniture, TV, fridges - simply everything possible.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">That day I went to the other end of the barracks, where the stolen objects were parked and kept me with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I sewed in and saw a couch where people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person that was tied up there.</seg>

<seg id="349">The incorrect translation was to be read from the 1st to the 20th of September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original photos by Joshua Levine, which has been widely divided into social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The error was the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. it was also he who drew attention to the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto Shimbun, which was published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "" "" "how could it result in such an English translation?" ""</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>

<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto Prefecture apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she stated that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for their accuracy before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are sincerely sorry that older people felt offended by inadequate correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed the phenomenon of 'terrible' elderly motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"" "the word" "" "terrible" "" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists, who are implicated in accidents across the country, is quite a cause of concern." ""</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, which corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, you need two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and actively language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate the translation into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies that do not have foreign employees leave translations within the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is rated as the best, is made a translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The sentences and enigmatic phrases that are created by machine translations show that this technique cannot replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest English phrases in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that often decorate T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable as jewellery or at least be harmless. but from large corporations or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, more careful translations can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="389">The city of Kyoto hopefully uses a more serious source for its translations in the future.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar of Libertad" (Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the websites of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online broadcasters also carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas organised by oppositional groups opposing the government of NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the Executive and the Supreme Court themselves.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was capped and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to get access to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: activates your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers are once again locked.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offerings such as Vivoplay are popular among Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of unrest.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been hesitant in reporting on protests since 2014. at that time, the commission for telecommunication threatened them with fines and closures if they would continue to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission saw this as a "call to violence."</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered at @ vivoplaynet again.</seg>
<seg id="403">It is astonishing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEinfilek later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the Domain Name System (DNS) but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transmits its sessions.</seg>
<seg id="405">Earlier research by the Institute of Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique through which the DNS server requests certain domains flawed.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a web site is blocked by the DNS, the server will prompt or deny the request when you visit such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We acknowledge a DNS ban: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">VPITV, a third locked channel, was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores was detained in Caracas live.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it is also reported that the government regulates Internet connections: this makes Venezuelans more difficult access to multimedia coverage of current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university, she once again returned to the house and heard the owner of the house proud of her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "the one that has become something," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she became ten years old, she started working as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, the more than 46.000 boys and girls, who are forced to work, are called Criadita to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The business is quite simple: a large family with little money hands over her underage son or her underage daughter to another, more abundant family. in exchange, the child receives food, an education and a roof above the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to pay for countless days of housework, which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that one cannot lift.</seg>
<seg id="425">The practice referred to as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for several years for an organization that fights for the rights of the boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with criadita - especially young girls were affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected evidence, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude that is inoculated by the Criadita guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"" "" "" "the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," "" "explains Alvarenga." ""</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and "make something out of themselves," is handed over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes up the girl and justifies its exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance, who would otherwise have no education, and perhaps even starved.</seg>

<seg id="435">In January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households, received a face.</seg>
<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed signs of severe beatings. shortly afterwards she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">It was Criadita in the household of the former military unit TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant in the Population Register Office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small town with just 3.000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016 Ferreira struck with a stick on MarÃ­n until she suffered fatal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later, the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people gathered in protest-making demonstrations and demanded that there would be no further Carolina "in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely distributed in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay more cows are registered as children," lamented Tina Alvarenga.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control how boys and girls live under what conditions.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case occurs before the Court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n may be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">The Life of a Crimean</seg>
<seg id="455">The criadita are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls in their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik Party, where her father worked, had to sign in bankruptcy and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers had to work now and started selling sweets on the street or on the market in order to make money.</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of her employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">On Fridays for example, she cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But even this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but she didn't get unlimited food either. "I needed more books from the house's library as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">In some evenings the host Alvarenga was forced to stand next to him and read editorial from opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince her not to believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"the host had found someone who listened while talking about politics," she says.</seg>
<seg id="472">"they didn't allow me to visit my family often because they thought that I would learn" bad habits "there." so they thought that Alvarenga, who belongs to the indigenous group of Guarani, would return home to their mother tongue guaranÃ­ back home.</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education that they had enabled them to lose.</seg>
<seg id="474">She was completely clear, however, that she had paid for all she got from them with their hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">In school too, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing about which almost never is spoken is mobbing and harassment that criadis are exposed to when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anyone to come home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships arise, I felt particularly clear that I was not a member of any group.</seg>

<seg id="505">Within six months, with the adoption of the law, users must register on the website of the site with their proper names and identity numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">If it fails to do so, this could result in a penalty of up to six months in prison or a wallet.</seg>
<seg id="507">The bill, consisting of six paragraphs, and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as "any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video views, and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">It is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should put the registration to the users. it is also unclear how they should account for those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media enterprises.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activist Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persican leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the larger family of the leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belongs to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether they are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain type of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"" "as Raza shows in the video," "" "the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator." ""</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes towards zero. when the team in the video states that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza gets out of sheer joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza wants to portray a different side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies of wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of things in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School on Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and still occupied the region with the reconstruction.</seg>

<seg id="544">In early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, who was responsible for Northeast Japan, documented the progress achieved over the past six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" of March 2011. an enormous earthquake, a tsunami and an atom crash in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">Kahoku Shimpo newspaper is based in Sendai, located in the Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was an etectable prefect in Japan northeast that both experienced the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring prefectures Fukushima and Iwate were forced to flee because the tsunami had made whole coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima Prefecture and Fukushima experienced a nuclear accident, and 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone for this reason alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">The Kahoku Shimpo Special Report shows from a local point of view that progress has been reached six years later to rebuild the local residents "lives.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned substitutes (the European flag, the flag of Saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi was able to record the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, even six years after the catastrophe, the evacuated of accommodation shelters (the admits, casetsu juutaku) must be relocated into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe, almost 80,000 people were forced to live in shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="557">Almost 40 percent of Evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters while Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuees who were in homes after the disaster were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the figure is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools affected by disaster have opened their gates until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 per cent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing ports have resumed their operation in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident caused extensive involvement in the three prefectures of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of farmland in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, as only 690 hectares of the land of Fukushima destroyed by 5 400 hectares are located in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures the tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far outstricken.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are up to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal population is more difficult to earn their living.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to be able to determine an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuees. she inquired about the status of reconstruction and how her empathy has changed compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In their introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more information about the tsunami consciousness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in disasters prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its issue to the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the mighty earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, disaster-induced nuclear accident that Japan had ever had to experience.</seg>
<seg id="578">Of 160,000 Evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent substitute houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the 2017 stand, there are still 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside of their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the disaster areas most of the evacuees who still live in shelters, older than 50 years old, fail because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When people come across from other countries speaking a different language, the differences seem to be greater than common ground.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that it connects more than it seems at first glance.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our prospects and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices podcast, we look at exactly these global connections. in our Into the Deep podcast, we treat issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherini remembers how the love of music has strengthened her affection for the Iranian culture; Violeta Camarasa talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="594">Reight: Mateus Ferreira da Silva on a widely used photo.</seg>
<seg id="595">A Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week: last Friday, a police officer had beaten him against his head during a demonstration in GoiÃ¢nia. nationwide, millions of demonstrators took part in a march against austerity.</seg>
<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studied social sciences at the University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull-brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>
<seg id="597">Doctors operated on him this Saturday and moved him into an artificial coma.</seg>
<seg id="598">His condition is considered critical.</seg>
<seg id="599">The local photo journalist Luiz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mateus, which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days.</seg>
<seg id="600">On the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a strokes. the man was identified as Augusto Sampaio.</seg>
<seg id="601">After the incident, the military police in the Brazilian state of GoiÃ¡s reported that Sampaio had been suspended until the incident was concluded by the active ministry.</seg>
<seg id="602">The pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mateus Ferreira in GoiÃ¢nia (photos: Luiz da Luz).</seg>
<seg id="603">If a police officer was beaten by a demonstrator and landed on the intensive care unit, his face would be seen on television for six months and all the repression would be justified.</seg>
<seg id="604">The Facebook page "Desneuralizador," a press channel of media activists from GoiÃ¢nia, shared the video recorded by Luiz da Luz on the net, in which one sees how Proteus is attacked by the police officer and several paramedics shortly afterwards hurry to him.</seg>
<seg id="605">Another video with the same scenes, but filmed from a different perspective, has also appeared in the social networks.</seg>
<seg id="606">In the clip shown below you can see the attack on eus from the 50th second.</seg>
<seg id="607">For the family of Mateus, who lives in another state, Internet users meanwhile have donated 10,000 Brasilian relays (approximately 2,700 euros) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in GoiÃ¢nia while lying in hospital.</seg>

<seg id="613">GoiÃ¡s has witnessed a wave of political violence: here the activist Guilherme Irish was killed by his father because he supported the Occupy movement in secondary schools. here, the military police of a WhatsApp group joined the intensive care unit after he was attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stroke.</seg>

<seg id="617">The MP Flavio Serafini, Socialist and Peace Party (PSOL), asked the police to renounce violence against demonstrators via loudspeakers.</seg>
<seg id="618">This includes a report in Folha de S. Paulo, one of the oldest newspapers all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="619">Again, the Brazilian media have covered street protests by directing the focus on another unexpected protagonist: a window screen.</seg>
<seg id="620">The Folha de S. Paulo and Estado de S. Paulo extensively reported on a broken glass window in order to illustrate their title pages in an illustrative manner with a photo.</seg>
<seg id="621">O Globo, on the other hand, preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire.</seg>
<seg id="622">There is no plausible journalistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause.</seg>
<seg id="623">This must also be recognised if one is strictly against any kind of material damage.</seg>
<seg id="624">Here too the term "vandalism" obtains an absurd, disproportionate meaning, and the typical acts of violence of the military police are covered by headlines with the title "protesters on confrontation with the police."</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Ãlvaro Reynoso law, nearly hundreds of sugar cane factories in all of Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich's congregation, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as the Spanish sugar mill, despite the fact that there is no significant harvest of sugars on site.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the fall, the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region, and the factory lost its facilities, until only the steel and concrete scaffolding remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier veteran who stops every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which after a long inactive time are back into operation, because they have been preserved.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene feels like having heard that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, the low market prices, inefficiency, bad administrative decisions and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016, the production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the amount produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no longer a news.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the church saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction in the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centavos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the price of sugar rose again about a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugar must be between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, published in the 2016 report on "Agricultural Economics" by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Food and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate around 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will certainly go down in history," "" "that was the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 at the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people, received their full salaries for further education.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened at the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has been working in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">"" "when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about the closure of the factory, the word he repeats most is" "" "cheating." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents were of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first anniversary of the year, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">It was officially written documents, which differed only with respect to the parts that would be removed, the address and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the Minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was passed and the letters were getting more and more frequent.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he assures.</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities across Canada are occupied with themes that are important to them. they do this by hip-hop, thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then worked together with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The Northstars.</seg>
<seg id="695">"" "the workshop is thus increasing the fact that the young participants learn topics like" "" "cultural identity, language, debate, love, self-acceptance" "" "or whatever comes to mind." ""</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspired by songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the trunk of the Winnebago in Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Western Canada, where almost two dozen young women mostly disappeared or murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the young people are not native to the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved were given some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstar hip-hop group who gave them a verse in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as a youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise someday</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and go forward as well as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator</seg>
<seg id="713">In the comments section, the reader and advocate of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also contributes and adds the verse in syllabus (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost any restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">To show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (the way to the "Plastic models of the dishes") of any food that is served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can look at these plastic dishes and then decide whether they will enter or go on the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the tokier district of Kappabashi there are a number of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into showy cell phone accessories and other gadgets today.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the Blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new mobile tapes decorated with plastic ribbons, as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods have been turned into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition at the Tokyo station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) turned into a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your cell phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And that is only the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there someone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic courts can also take on a less appetizing form in order to surprise, for example, colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and handyards made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">Other quirky plastic dishes can be viewed at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow us on Twitter the hashtag #.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media on the notorious "fight against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the Missing and Getting regularly appear only in statistics. these, however, do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">The coverage of drug bosses such as El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, chief of the Sinaloa cartel, pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident, no one looks at the bereaved or on the churches that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">There are behind each bone, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">For this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking") to give these victims a voice and tell stories of people involved in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>

<seg id="778">Your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal, no matter in what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been acquainted with illness and sensationalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I pass the newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from files of specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the version.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only thing that is disgusting or sad. it works like a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent to it or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues writing:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he's great. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the "heroic deeds" of offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"" "the inaction of people is incredible to me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village are justified by being" "" "watered up" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not stir and are still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the capital district: how a family was plundered by threats." in this it describes how armed criminals extorted money from their business month for month until they had destroyed not only the business but also tore their family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain of this never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits have changed, phone numbers too.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The further we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She concluded her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days, I wondered whether there would be tears of my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Children of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a generation of violence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction, he raises questions like: who cares for the child of a missing wife and a man murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow up in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells us he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells about nine scars on his left leg - one for every age.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was over two years earlier, when he was only a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men out of a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as a force through organised crime and the fight against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Civil Security Council and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor's office was 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Just a few stories still live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking which has tormented the country in the last four decades.</seg>

<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, no matter if true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its initial release, it has been misleading to depict tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false coupling of picture and event - "false description" or "false context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tanker crossed the village of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilting around and exploding. 230 people lost their lives.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and devastated. the streets in the region became dangerous trails full of potholes that were difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to it.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball which enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema nearby, which was full of people watching the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charted corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "That is Nigeria." by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident depict the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies lined up on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not come to an end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo has been raised several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not related tragedies, especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened not in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, fighters of the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eye witnesses reported drastic atrocities to which they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the numbers could not be confirmed." "" "nobody stayed behind to count corpses," "" "said one of Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many had been shattered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unclear, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the Nigerias military and the attempt of Boko Haram to win the land (examples of 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture emerged from the DR Congo as it was wrongly presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a series of false attributions; Africa Check has documented states of Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases, the picture was presented as a proof for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">One step further, personal comments such as this example mistakenly associate the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the fatal persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash announcement, published by the United Nations, those who could flee were beating punches, rape and several dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following who brought these descriptions together with photos from DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Saudi-Arab news site, falsely claiming in 2012, Myanmar's Thein Thein being said, monks and politicians allegedly participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the picture from DR Congo to picture this information.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussion of the silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the assassination of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">Wanting to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">A deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "social media are eighty people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">This mood of false and false information suggests that actual atrocities are untrue and insulates the actual horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent pictures has already been debated in detail (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that withholding images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these images are even demanded by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is concern that violent images of readers and viewers are desensitizing and taking the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigated how violent media work on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is the fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be used by context or in a completely improper way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, any investigation of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. unbridgeable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a choice of words from around the world which are difficult or not at all to translate.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings, which are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these invaluable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese Saudi) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish Imperesa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly any attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a little context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected in an online list for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists cover Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words, while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">In the blog you can find, for example, words from the Tap-clap language of Vanuatu, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - strive for your parents in recognition of how they have tried for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">Words in the HunsrÃ¼ck language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness you feel after being warmed in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and awaken our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish more of these "insurmountable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive are these little languages.</seg>

<seg id="972">After an opinion of the disaster center of Sri Lanka from May 28, 2017, 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people were missing because of the floods and mud avalanches.</seg>
<seg id="973">More than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people have been brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rainfalls continued on Saturday (27 May) and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased.</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the areas affected and still inaccessible.</seg>

<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups have also agreed to help.</seg>

<seg id="988">The taxi-call-app Pickme (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app, so that the disaster center is informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the catastrophe of the Tropensturms Roanu, Pickme introduced a "flood aid" button, allowing users to call a vehicle for pick up assistance and donations. these were then transmitted to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched a "SOS" button, which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for flooding and landslides.</seg>
<seg id="991">The combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka, with which several social media platforms are fully exploited, bring people in need in security and provide help measures.</seg>

<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions after the role of "others" deliberately and unconsciously; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the employment that we have no president, while he already bombed caputte countries and "other made" people, goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for Narrative Art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Story telling, by Flickr user Daniele Rossi, using the CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS) initiative, telling stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honor the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk is that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the creators of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often associated with understanding" "" "these events are instead" "" "listening to cherish, feel, touch" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format storytellers introduce their story in their own language first and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and presentation will result in the audience getting involved.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video, for example, shows a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamus tells the parable of the rabbit and the Baboon in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">After explaining the meaning of his parable, John Nyafara is asked: "what is it like to talk to an audience that doesn't understand their language?" with a broad smile, he shares his feeling of inclusiveness:</seg>
<seg id="1150">You've listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all who are inspired by the project can come in contact with TLS to organize their own storytelling stories.</seg>

<seg id="1155">With the objective of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march started at the South African Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old town of San Juans.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (Ciudadano Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda) and the Comenical church meeting of Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the new enforcement of the debt also submitted a petition to the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debts are responsible for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without personal interest in public debts, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy." ""</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for more than a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has made for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture, which is hosted in Berlin, there was an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, managing director of Book Sprints, produced excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a collective research).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is freely available here contains a series of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it reads:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements are built for free knowledge and what are the real costs associated with it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors involved in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our different experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers who have been detained in Syria since March 15, 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was knitted from the directory of the Adra jail in which he was sitting on October 3, 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book, entitled Collective Remembrance, gives his friends and family a voice that wants to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing Bassel paying a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own destinies, deeds and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activists has been in custody by Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military institution.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police Bassel" had taken part in a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal in his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 who presented themselves as the insider of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">His whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Bassels's cultural prototype was more foresighted than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the world's most important archaeological sites, was the crossroads of many civilizations and here Greek-Roman architecture types blend with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">At that time Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he started working with this work, the IS would do everything to extinguish this architecture, which not only embodies the cultural heritage of Syria but of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Funnily, this project has not yet been completed.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent all my life in dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English even when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he has taught other detainees to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of waiting (waiting), a sabotage which she wrote to her husband in 2012-2015 when he was in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">Since 2011, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in jail since 2011.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>

<seg id="1254">"" "Mozambique:" "" "due to corruption-convicted director after release again on previous post" ""</seg>
<seg id="1255">Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption that a government member returned to work in the state machine after half of his prison sentence where corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010, along with four other defendants, of 54 million Metical (about 800 000 Euros).</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council was managing Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good leadership and immediately called for his resetting to the company, which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with the opinion of the Attorney General's Office of the Republic, which evaluated the motion, there would be no reason for any obstacles to relate to Cambaza, as the company did not undertake any disciplinary proceedings following his imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many inhabitants do not mean the action.</seg>
<seg id="1261">In an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency, condemned the company's decision to re-establish the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system," "" "says the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that even the company should have initiated a disciplinary action against the offenders.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently kept silent however and did not undertake appropriate legal steps for the use of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the social media of Mozambique, rejects this behaviour and considers the case "vile."</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had sat down.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish up his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But since he is incompetent, he consents to be incorporated into the company, which he helped to cause harm.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Undisguised!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil said the director has no moral:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him. I can't believe that you are rewarded with such a way that the state has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morale to return and serve the state, * he had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but has instead served itself only by the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">Honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded.</seg>

<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known Social Network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still being discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indicate or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censuses the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or the advices" "" "(in Burmese Scripture) as part of an initiative to tackle the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar" may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech.</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts in which they discussed the use of the word have been censored for their use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings that have the same sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooknutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a play.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "Healing" + the question mark (la) on Burmese - is very similar to the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet believes that it will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before releasing all posts that are suspected of disseminating racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you are writing to Factook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and control it by checking the words next to it.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech get a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise her nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the campaign may send a strong signal to anyone who disseminates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship is often a cat and mouse game, whereby users of social networks can simply start using a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts by telling his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and the liking, post and sharing of content was prohibited for 24 hours, because the mail "didn't correspond to the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author expressed his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism are bad in the country.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will bring even more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and so words like "chair" or "pea curry" have banned.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified trusts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech in order to see if their posts are taken off the network.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which didn't contain any hate speech, but removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "just to try out if Facebook is removing the mail containing the word" "" "Kalar" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post states" "" "If you are a doctor, do you then heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists, which have used social networks to expand their voices and influence, have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, Hassan in social networks should additionally heat the violence in the communes in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine area, where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists forced thousands to flee.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its Burmese sides.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at context rather than code-concentrating initiatives and learn from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Before this change of marriage, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities held in practice, and in May 2016 there was a big public scream. at that time Brother Harryperch Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), said that the state should not interfere since that, old age did not determine the maturity.

<seg id="1347">Statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the percentage of children who had been married to 15 was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 it was 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the Federal Statistical Office of the country confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1300 young were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements aimed at abolishing laws on children's marriage followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. doubtless they helped bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the childrens, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition resulted in tensions in this uncomplicated situation, and at some point doubts arise if the opposition would agree to the draft bill at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite four senators (among them a woman) of the opposition and an independent one that contained - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law proclaim." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram again:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">Having previously been decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws on child marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk disguised at the heart of the matter, but do you know what? the childrens are now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that's worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was of the opinion, it took long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>

<seg id="1375">But a possible hook arises in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the general secretary of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj has announced his intention to take legal steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to deliver his promise now.</seg>
<seg id="1377">While the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished that the debate would be different.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the debate so generally, if we, instead of addressing the problem, would simply talk about the fact that the state protects our daughters from being abused by large, hard-boiled men that are in the advantage of them, "would you be willing to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">However, whether it comes to legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where infant's marriage in different gradations is legal or still the norm, although there are laws which they prohibit.</seg>

<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was presented internationally in the USA on 18 January 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For more than a month, Turkey has been blocking its popular and crowdsourcing principle on Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series oppose the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many tech-savvy Internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the world's third-largest VPN prevalence), most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking an article by Wikipedia, as recently posted in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked there are now several mirror sites (pages that mirror the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the Interplan File System), when the platform put all the Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. calculator computer connections), which does not rely on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">Despite the legal ban, the content is irrevocable.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogger, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we started to stop snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. thus, there is the possibility to read the contents on decentralized and distributed ways.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it was merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirror site of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and co-workers at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server further directs the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Because this is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo of Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and washed colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune's wildlife to the international stage.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class situation helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live on the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could there be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river would be a leopard.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was on and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he ought to know, for he was already standing face to face face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep in sleeping!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the book appeared. he immediately sits down, we look at ourselves and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar placed the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">His passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist accommodation.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This post was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women should avoid addressing the names of their husbands or even of older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">"" "instead they use a pronoun or say" "" "father of my child." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should disregard the norm, keep this practice alive.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state of Odisha by a pseudo-judgment and rejected by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married family with a name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of not calling their wives by the name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer privileges to fear, if at all they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village Walhe in the district of Pune in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main topic of discussion in the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them, in which they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is run by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paist has been working with her video camera for seven years using her video camera to detect practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected, and directs these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">It tells them how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was of women who don't call their husbands on their name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open up the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the name of their husbands aloud is a custom that they have perpetually maintained and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not believe this is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband on behalf of her husband, wanted to try out how it works.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"" "Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some believed that it was a good thing because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked everybody," "" "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can tell us how they want, that means they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equivalent?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they brought the name of their husbands over their lips," says Rohini Paste from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking a century-old tradition where married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells us:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only chained before herself; another decided to release the whole pent-up frustration against him and his family by cursed.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenalin rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she got afraid and said it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the carcinogenic spot on the forehead, indicating the status of the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnoberred point if he did it either.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped bearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped doing so, but think they are now in a better position to choose themselves, not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want the women to worry about who could hear anything," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last few months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a round of discussions we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to the clothes.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only borne saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a sage curta, a wide shirt over a pair of trousers; they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much debate and discussion about the advantages of their own coat-of-clothes, the morals combined with the saris and much more, smuggled Rohini slipped their own pair of kurtas (torshirts) into a discussion round so that the women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed.</seg>
<seg id="1531">The question of whether in the five months has already changed since her first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of their husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, do it, but only if they are alone and are not members of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - such as haste for more freedom of movement or their own clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">As stated in Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1549">On June 29th this year, the hashtag was held in the hands of the courageous to find the Beatles memorial day in the Japanese Twitter Trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is considered a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who interviewed the Beatles in London in 1964, remarked in 2016 on the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just barely five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here realized quite quickly that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! today is the Beatles memorial day in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Also today songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese karaoke bars and in the English classes at Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today Beatles memorial day is.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love the Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "I don't know if this" "" "Winnie the Pooh" "" "doll should represent John Lennon or not." ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese people of course also make pilgrimages to the well-known places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, these are your 5 places that you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Mathew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (New York Memorial)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (From the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">Pilgrimages sometimes cannot be quirky enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today Beatles memorial day is.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966 the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the movie K-On! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">We did the same last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies also use the fan community in terms of market terms, such as this Ramen Shop (Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! today is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could this be for a day?</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald-headed people for organ trafficking, probably for superstitious purposes, is disturbing the ZambÃ©zia Police, a province in Mozambique. the local government has now called for a number of operations to stop practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometers from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently believed that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi are used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia said to the BBC.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of assassination for obscure purposes, is people with Albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 conducted a mission in the South African country to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of Southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the assassination took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussel Algy Adamo, student and resident of the town of Inhamstre in the south of Mozambique, said that the local police already follow the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The prosecution and assassination of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of ZambÃ©zia, has been commissioned by the traditional shamans, this draw the police of the Republic of Mozambique in consideration (PRM), which also indicates that there was a belief that the victims in the head might have power to generate the wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">Angela Ferreira Samantha shared on Facebook the chronicle of Bloggers's poor Snappa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>
<seg id="1603">I MÃCHTE GERNE EIN Mosambique, THE SME foams a country in which the people would have shame to go to the streets, and girls would be ashamed to offer sex against good marks, a nation where people would walk honestly or even take their lives to earn their bread, a land in which neither the Albinos nor bald or bald-headed people are hunted, who aim to get rich wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1604">Despite the seriousness of the phenomenon, some of the opportunities for flawless humour could not be missed.</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably only recently made.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer at the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the State Department in China referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a spokesman, he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, the Nobel Prize winner and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to enable him to treat overseas.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others have completely wiped out the subject.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some foreign reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations united nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway - Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China, since exports were largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately liberate Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The EU's top diplomat, Federica Mogherini, also called for the release of Lius, as announced in a statement on 30 June:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift all limitations of Mr Liu's wife and family member.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They should meet and receive all visits they wish and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">United States of America</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told him that the Americans" "" "wish him the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as it could help him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced the AFP news agency on June 27 that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to release his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the US Embassy summoned a furious response from China, with the Foreign Ministry's statement that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The US Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also adopted a resolution in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally.</seg>
<seg id="1658">I urge China to release the Nobel laureate # LiuXiaobo unconditionally so that he can go into a proper medical treatment. http: / / bit.ly / 2tE6kUo</seg>
<seg id="1659">Germany as well as Germany</seg>
<seg id="1660">German government spokesman Steffen Seibert wrote on July 3, Berlin, hoping that Liu will receive all the medical support he needs, and that a "humanitarian" solution for Liu Xiaobo should be the highest priority. "</seg>
<seg id="1661">The Chinese President Xi Jinping was released on July 7 and 8 at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing hosted the Reuters news agency that China had great concerns whether the vortex of Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide Liu with adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Liu attorney previously told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police have always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to talk to anyone outside, including his lawyers, to speak and contact.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum says further:</seg>
<seg id="1667">Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and freedom to exercise these rights.</seg>
<seg id="1668">France - France</seg>
<seg id="1669">On 29 June, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments he needs, regardless of where he needs. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information if France will finally accept it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan Airport, Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of mainland Europe in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislature, Yu-Mei-nu, of the ruling democrat Progressive Party, also called on China to allow the sick intellectual Liu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, expressed himself very much in a statement on 28 June by Liu and admitted that many have asked him to pray for Lius well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens, inspired by Liu Xiaobo, signed the Charter 08 which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state at an international level.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was supposed to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association, the minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog" "" "Cavalierio" "" "accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of this, it seemed invariably undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently guided by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the topic, the good old lyre emerges from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic as it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the answers given in the last week of Shanmugam received answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judicial, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He addressed these questions with a rational manner with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his mind as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally, I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">If Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our noteworthy K Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point, provided he was paid highly to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">Announcing his commentary on the blog, he points out that he should begin to read the entire address of the conference so that one could better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was more a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so unequal, even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore to cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said Singapore" "" "be no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as the leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that is another matter.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of Singapore's political leaders, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is properly associated and aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review decomposes the weak points of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr Shanmugam" "" "committed a mistake" "" "or was it a Freudian speaker?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">If Singapore is not a country, we are only considered an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, on which country go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the Cabinet, statements by Mr. Shanmugam are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who has to pay back our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"" "the magazine" "" "Journey of a Decade" "" "tends to affirm, Singapore is and was always a city:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often listen to statements like" "" "the defence of the country especially" "", "but that is not quite right." ""</seg>

<seg id="1745">My clarification often follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, ice hockey, nature." many Canadians perhaps cook inwardly with rage when they are held for Americans, but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who does not know, there is little that Canadians distinguish us from Americans.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border with Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59-year-old Mexican singer, a young woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold-colored earrings in Teddy Bears.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name of Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about 2.50 dollars the night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless, hundreds of African and Haitian migrants are arriving here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"" "sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez recounts, the people are coming in full small buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to cry out:" "" "mom Africa!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez already received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already been sleeping outside on cardboard boxes.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, she buys them medication they can't afford, she massively massaging them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived recently.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was a reasonable nickname for Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1924">They have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and Africans are often travelling together and that Africans already speak on Whatsapp by Ms RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, he previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy became weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mum Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"" "" "" "mom Africa is our mother and we will never leave her again," "" "he said, smiling." "" "we will always stay in touch." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her that her guests often send her text messages when they went away to greet her or to report about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for migrants travelling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"" "" "" "I lived in the United States," "" "he says." "" "I experienced what they are experiencing." ""</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others don't help. that's why I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job site.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children, who wanted to squeeze money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single teacher, offered him their roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later the family is still living there and she tries to decide where to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa, everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the corridors, the travellers quietly consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but she's also nostalgic because of those who went away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she flips in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair lichen that her has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many more travelers, boy and old.</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly, while she prefers her.</seg>

<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang people are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile phone call to install the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or "Web Cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the message it is said that the app" "" "prevent" "" "access to terrorist information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities also managed to use the app for more than fighting terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because, just after they had installed the app, they exchanged messages with a private WeChat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police report found that the app would identify and track the sources and distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information," including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic web pages, from online scams, trojans and phishing pages to alert users about how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with filtering for minors is meant to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">For example, the "remote control" could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person.</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While messages about digital censorship in China are mostly focused on users' experiences in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, repressed ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The Twitter-based media outlet "Images from mainland China" which censored messages posted in China showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen picked up the residents indiscriminately as to whether they had installed the surveillance app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The Xinjian authorities make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, it could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">You have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity by the recovery technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Mao's China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "also published a Jingwang product description from which it comes out that the software can lift the password requirement of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"" "" "" "the regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions given by the City Party Council to minimize dissemination of illegal content." ""</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, public authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi to register their "personal ID cards, cell phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards" at the local police.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and annihilate any "terrorist videos." however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a whole range of other possible offence, including those referring to peaceful religious or political communications.</seg>

<seg id="2090">Jordanian Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and resistance</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time indoors; sometimes he locks to his screen, sometimes to his computer, hin and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the top floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; the year when Israel completed its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine where they lived as fellows (about: farmers).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questions their old-proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapessionism.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities that range from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by limits in his thinking, and he can feel loud with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special dislike against the American foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones, has anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian escapees of the second generation" - so he refers to himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"" "" "" "I don't think so because of my own circumstances," "" "emphasizes Hdaib." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think so, because I am a human being" "", "while he pours into two cups in water. it's the holy month of Ramadan; during that time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a burning hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the lugs speak lukewarm coffee and the waistband of the Kent cigarette in the nose first and foremost of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently, the Interior Ministry announced a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front-singer Hamed Sinnai, contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms, is the main reason for the concert statement.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the MEPs and former press spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahrib said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "just" "" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights," who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism. "</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement should probably not be just rhetoric, but actually reflect an increasingly obvious reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender norms to body by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">She is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of countless women who lost their lives through the hands of those who they should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past few years, the number of "honorary morals" has been increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside is foregone.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of Volunteers reached its zenith in 2016; however, it is compounded that Jordan lacks the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on crime against crime in 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "indefinitely be detained in prison" and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee that the woman will have nothing to do.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs's music also enjoys great popularity and is well known for not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib dispute that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">I was informed of politics, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib attacking the question of the Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and "Ghareeb," the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song called "Santorano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gays and lesbians and that comments on equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been extensively censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib introduced an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to remember that his comments were torn out of context, distorted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a edited version was streamed," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuevo, a poet of the eighth century, who remains in memory even today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nuevo, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">There is nothing new in the hashemite kingdom that the government sanction attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service seized several former members of the government and members of the teacher association with the reason that they critically expressed themselves on comments in social media related to the corruption rooted in the deeply rooted corruption of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural rethinking in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now prevented Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - that is Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place every day in the heart of the Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of "experiencing them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions, and artificially induced democracies.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to rap and consequently resist.</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer centre on Crisis Reporting, which Aman belongs to as a Student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebula in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big extravagant warriors dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Nebula Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">One suspects that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in many areas of Tohokus in August. another theory states that the fortresses, drums and dancing have been handed over more than one thousand years ago and came from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the Northeast to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the emissushi, to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can only imagine how big these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally).</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen again for a long time: two solid cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebula Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend its summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The view of a 18 meter high fortress was incredible.</seg>
<seg id="2163">Let us enjoy the rest of the summer!</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth out of crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are everyday.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for esthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, appearance and therefore also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes like Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to more and more regular citizens to go to the experienced hands of hairdressers who can recreate these expensive hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been held since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There experts are competing against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy school, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to persuade young people to trade their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hair art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year that began in March and reported on some of its achievements:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995, we were the only technical school in the municipality and the district, which we are very proud of, because we have built up this education community because of love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerrillas</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love messages to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Is it not even more important to accommodate people who feel expelled?</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question left the young Colombian activist Leonardo PÃ¡rraga of the Bogotart Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation and inspired them to the campaign of Cartas por la legliaciÃ³n, which encouraged young people to write letters to guerrillas.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia) that forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was considered so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">Before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters, who had lived in illegal refugee camps for many years, were exposed to a rhetoric of war and were carrying their weapons around the clock, must now integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, once accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla struggles, must now take up its ranks and support them in building a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians must unite and help in the process of integration.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrillas back in order to welcome them back into society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighter who will then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as an inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for the letters to reconciliation was based on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates who took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak to Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year.</seg>
<seg id="2198">So the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">So far more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manicales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotart Foundation traveled to the camp to personally convey the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members stood up as they had done earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," said the political student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut where the guerrillas lived) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "nevertheless, I asked him," "" "Hello, what are you doing?" "" "he said," "" "I reply to a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"" "" "" "never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "" "suddenly tears ran over the cheeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was tired of the war, it was sad to be the faithful companion of this warrior for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never expected something different from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before the Hungertod. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now, I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices in new voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">At the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together for a discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up and the FARC was already in hiding.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC said the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have witnessed the social injustice of the state to the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop into a political party, we can help shape society more just in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "a goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," "" "said one of them." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and realizing that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate people with beautiful feelings, who were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful to me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives is hurting.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who killed and caused so much harm, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have replied to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote the following letter to the Archbishop of the town of Cali:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that peace would reign after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, rise up and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call all supporters of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and offer sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2262">When I was about to bring out a few shopping bags from my car's back seat, I heard a male voice saying: "here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt a bit in my body, but I didn't hurt.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to dishonor the family, you Schandfleck?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I did not know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up at the end of the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had received everything and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital, I learned that I had two cuts in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wing were you placed - in which the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are out of date, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and put me to the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I first read his name at his office, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for having resorted to me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me and wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to send back to Chechnya to prove that all this was a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They put absurd demands: some said to me that I must prove it by running through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grozny and say that I had not changed my gender, that all was just bad speech, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family manage to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "They have brought a monster to the world, which has humiliated not only your family but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">"" "we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you have to disappear from here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2291">It was too much for my mother and she put a rope around his neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Fortunately the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there was a car with dark windows under the window and a number plate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it had happened for the third time it became clear to me that there was something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Without registration, I bought it without registration, without registration.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked in at the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"" "at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "" "you don't think you'd be safe just because you left the country?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you get stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">But we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditionally Caucasian elements I still carry in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, this spiritual barrier I cannot overcome.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I really trouble watching the person they remember from their past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed dormant?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in a gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He told that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could barely wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not exclude a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">This is what I mean, they probably charge the relatives, they take care of the problem with the person concerned, and in the end we demand a proof that the so-called "honor" is experienced by the blood of satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men now still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there's not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all, those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to execute Gaddafi's court.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can later present them as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they had attacked some village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically submerged in order to radicalise themselves.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is that just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was detained in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, this person was himself when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports to date. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always been wearing my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already known in Grozny, when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, back then it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to introduce us to the" "" "Civilization" "", "but in the end it was thrown back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Sharia has never bent a hair on me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grozny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"" "in the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "" "Don't worry about the misfortune of another." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says it to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they thought you were sick?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never offended me, never hunted and never struck.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began speaking on television about morality.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He spoke not about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless - you could feel how the people in the city started to change.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In that time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that, I am still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organise teacups, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food menus.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't spend a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I stumbled away places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenoff?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to expose you to foam in front of the mouth that there are no gaols.</seg>
<seg id="2385">The Dagestanans have which, the Kabardines have which, the Russians have whatever; on the whole planet they exist - but not in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2386">I come from there, so it's unpleasant for me to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during the Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">You know, many think at transitty to men who love men, and they believe that you change their sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different types of feeling to be exact, different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">I'm sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all, because I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">There has been a sharp rise in suicide since the last few months.</seg>

<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 moved the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran which is marked by poverty and unemployment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability of his family to arise, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and wish to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August in the Arab Ahrazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that more men could take life.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Tamim - have imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: it was all family patrons who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government, and to pursue a safe work.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahrazi is suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahrazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the indigenous Arab population to contend its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab ancestor was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and in 1925 underwent major efforts to end ethnic autonomy in the whole of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most productive and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population receives only little of this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi-Arabs systematically jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arabic regions in the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only managed to aggravate the desolation caused by drought, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab Ahawsi youngsters increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, announced that 5% of the Ahwazis, who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school and 45% completed a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the mind of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, a human rights activist who resides in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination," leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging in Ahraz and anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:" ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">Since officials and institutions do not pretend to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahrazi and to be hired as even Arab names in the workplace are not tolerated, let alone the speech of the Arabic language or the wearing of Arab clothing.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In view of the given circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi have to endure, human rights activists beat the alarm before the situation becomes explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and becoming aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>
<seg id="2430">Depression is treatable and suicide is preventable.</seg>

<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. captured by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the AfrofÃ©minas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women, who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and societal arguments in front of me, why I should be feminist and why we should generally be feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, nowadays, despite the same education, women still earn less money than men.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later come across a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I suffer double and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: when I come to speak on skin colour, black women in the LGBTIQ community, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention the way we have always been misused in terms of racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists adopted not to mention women.</seg>
<seg id="2448">But they all agree that women - all women - should come together to "lift up their voices and" Kumbaya, my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalized form of racially motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are often referred to the school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering from domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I can't join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her thinking that relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my belonging in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourn complained in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I, too, refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is an evil and marginalised being in an historical sense.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groups that, in addition, absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation in order to advance their egocentric programme.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender, as some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women are trying to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different origins a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" still exists in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and to join the Movement of Womanism, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than engaging me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we have black women to define ourselves according to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, author of Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can in this way also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, corporal and even the spiritual elements that make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you to inform themselves about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of the feminist movement of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment, I can lift up black women and women of other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman, I am recognized as part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither bypassed nor ignored.</seg>

<seg id="2470">In this documentary by Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child," Musa tells.</seg>
<seg id="2472">Scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="2473">Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - which is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources.

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay" by cursory. the article belongs to the series # Porsermujer (# weighteinterraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed for the protection of the persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector told Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent over her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said their statement would be laid on the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena about ill-treatment, there was no use of Ada BÃ¡ez 'attention to detail.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second woman drew back her advertisement.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If women report a complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report to law enforcement agencies at all.</seg>

<seg id="2490">It is hard to find out how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian GonzÃ¡lez, researcher in gender issues at the Centro de DocumentaciÃ³n y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay. "there are different reports and reports that do not even reveal the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay," she explains.</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the numbers available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, the District Attorney Office included 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 advertisements for domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of the advertisements of women came here.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were mistreated physically, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"" "according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "" "on every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do so." ""</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on any woman who is refunded for bodily abuse, there are two women who do not do so," "" "she stated at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since women's murder in Paraguay is not an own offence, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">By August 2016 alone, journalists included at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violence by men.</seg>

<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In the beginning she did not want to do that, but then she did. this should be regretted forever.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she has endured the psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">"" "" "" "I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too subservient, because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming her name, she wrote posts on Facebook, where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of mistreatment.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had fallen so long by Carlos and didn't leave him sooner.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner was mistreating them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") consisting of women who are all in any way victims of abuse." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case, everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victoria advertisements with the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a process against her former partner, who developed into an unmanageable juridical struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>

<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees major problems in the application of the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016 a draft law was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# non-eWeniger) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees that feminid is an independent crime book and punishable to punish harsher as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the wording of the law was changed in a few ways in order to also win the deputies for the law, which feared that the way for the decriminalisation of abortions would be levelled, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had foreseen that the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence have to carry on themselves, if they simply restitute ad and would like to receive a secure accommodation, to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient financial resources for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay, mistreatment is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place so that violence is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Those who are silent in the face of these facts acquires themselves and contributes to the fact that the perpetrators are free to offend.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we need to refund so long before abuse is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. prior to that, parts of the law had been modified. among other things, a passage was cancelled, which the partners called for reconciliation in cases of domestic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions about the changes are going apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The reconciliation section was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">The cancellation of the words "gender," "political force" and "sexual harassment" from parts of the law, however, is considered a great setback.</seg>

<seg id="2546">"this website was closed on the basis of a resolution by the Minister of Information" published on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn.</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Ottoman authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn because of its reporting of corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, continues to be in prison where he is serving a one-year prison term.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and Zaher Al-Abri, were also arrested and tried, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been governed by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after having settled his father, Said ibn Taimur, by a coup d "Ã©tat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, alongside his role as the only sultan, he has professed the most important offices in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for the Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic intelligence, to restrict public freedoms, including freedom of the press, to torture and intimidate human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict the peaceful and legitimate activities in the area of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the public affairs of the country, such as corruption in authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>

<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order.</seg>
<seg id="2569">For Al-Abri, a deposit of 5000 omanities (13,000 US dollars) was set and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 before the pronouncement of the sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri on 26 December 2016, but al-Haj sentenced to six months in prison for a year and Al-Maamari.</seg>

<seg id="2573">Despite the decision of the Court to allow Azamn to resume, the newspaper continues to face attacks by the government of the Romansh government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order to extend the closure of "Azamn" by three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information signed a further statement in which the closing of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appeal to re-publish the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where the freedom of the press was injured in recent times in Oman.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, picture taken with his consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media or not at all. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on-site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment in the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research carried out by African scientists is helping build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">In the 1990s he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just when the AIDS epidemic first showed serious effects on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a Postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡mi healthcare system.</seg>

<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work lies on the application of research results. in doing so, I support the Serbian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">I am also currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>

<seg id="2615">Lab material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should they focus on, and how can we support development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is need for special academic education, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, space exploration, healthcare (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries, based on your experience?</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers are changing food production worldwide</seg>
<seg id="2628">This post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com webpage, a magazine that talks about solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outrageous, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by his own ingenuity and the question of how many types of lettuce he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it any further for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents are not only for single varieties, but also for certain properties, such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green, or crinkled leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cardboards. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still breeding lettuce, but it takes longer as his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it's like lying in a river a boulder to which I have to paddle." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think these patents go too far on salads." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And when they stand trial, no one can breed a new type of salad because all the characteristics are already patented. "so he continues to do as good as possible and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, he is very cautious and tries not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the United States and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding (Open Source "breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red tube salad of the Outredante grade in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested if plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seed) can be inspired by the movement for free open source software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property so that plant breeders can be used permanently.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do business with their seed and sell it. "open Source" breeders only allow others to breed their seeds so as to breed their own varieties, and not to cut it out immediately - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeritus professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of seed and the ability to breed new plants, both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">Seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">"" "Kloppenburg stresses that the" "" "open-source" "" "movement does not concern itself with genetically modified plants." ""</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from organic farming or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability," he says and participates in the ever increasing mergers in the global agriculture industry, the latest examples of the merging of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, as it is offered, for example, on farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables is bred is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to continue to provide their seeds to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant features.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk because the available genetic pool is constantly shrinking due to the ever-increasing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore increasingly restricted.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found that about one third of all the antitrust characteristics are protected as intellectual property, which makes it impossible for plant breeders to be used either at all or even more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not yet exist, but experts such as Luby assume that mass-grown plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of perspective</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specifically desirable characteristics - from those through which their taste or color improves until such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders takes more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently more necessary than ever since changing conditions are much worse due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions like the United States agricultural ministry, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">However, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is other breeders, since "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow once the patent expired.</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same conclusion using another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"" "such protection does not inhibit innovation, but supports it by providing more material and expertise to the public." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees it differently: waiting for 20 years until a patent expires, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, you would have lost the fight.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a general good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "" "" "we want to facilitate farmers their work." ""</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it will be impossible for us to continue using the best and newest genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant features:" "" "we do not really create the characteristics themselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form it themselves and as breeders, we finally have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Depeche, plant breeder in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi's board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "he who breeds a variety also breeds his own values into it.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures are needed for the cultivation of a mass of herbicides, which is breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is just opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than e.g. Monsanto) have patents, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either they reject the patent or they hold it for too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both is the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton seeks Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks as if I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalogue because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves, "he says." with a patent, it is protected against competition for 20 years, which makes it very easy in my opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="2683">Although the US seems to be a leader in open source breeding, the concept now spreads quickly around the world.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open-source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>

<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conventionally cultivated plants.</seg>

<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for Open Source seed systems, explains that the organization is currently building a global alliance for open source seed systems for which the official launch should be scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A merger of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of the censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of the 5th of August, the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), documenting human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported it above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published a statement on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world in spite of this attack and the mockery of the Egyptian right and the constitution. even though it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals, it was never as important as now. ANHRI confirmed that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome the distortion and not diminish. we insist on fulfilling our task further.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masur, the Arab-language edition of Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera due to alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organization of the wave of website locks to victims. @ anhri one of the main sources of data for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no more access to Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada uses his blog for the distribution of columns and articles, which he writes for websites and media not available in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog he set up to circumvent the censorship of the Egyptian government was himself the target of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider of the also ciadas blog, on the other hand, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while he talked about the student protests and recorded a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly revolving around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada spoke about the government's blockage and reflected what it means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They succeeded in imparting me the feeling of a state of siege; a arrest, attempted murder, summons to the National Security Council, the blocking blogs and any other web site I worked for.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words: my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles in order to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The courageous will go the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked the web from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and ETISALAT.</seg>
<seg id="2743">Afte also documented the blockage of providers that was possible through the circumvention of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12th, we noticed how the blocking of web pages that VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practices imply the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that might have access to Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are taken behind closed doors, so that the Egyptian population has no legal basis with which they can proceed against these actions in court.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian armed forces deployed in the Favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>

<seg id="2753">Day after day, newspapers in the whole of Brazil are reporting state-of-the-art headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "thieves rob pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends out 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and air afee to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the middle of the economic crisis and in a strained financial situation, the violence threshold in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation, Global Justice, even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "" "published on 16 August published the editorial" "" "That's not normal" "" "in which she announced to set up a new column called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper thus explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world, such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc., which, however, deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category "War in Rio." (...) This is our way to call: it's not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guede, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, declared that this decision was not an occasion for pride but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explains that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas that are controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, if it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police who are shooting and then asking questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose goal is not civilians, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira is arguing against violence as a "war." this is in her opinion a justification of the failed security policy by the media and could make it difficult to hold responsible for the police.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">This is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-acceptable neglect of the public service.</seg>
<seg id="2774">To remember: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2776">Photo by: Fernando FrazÃ£o / AgÃªncia Brasil. published with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2777">According to CecÃ­lia, Rio de Janeiro is considered to be "the most violent place in Brazil," according to CecÃ­lia: "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and north-east of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the morrow's per state, Rio is ranked 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">It is part of Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as CecÃ­lia stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These security policy measures included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to capture a favela by deploying a massive police camp and permanently stationing a unit there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent death cases. but, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under attack after several reports of harassment and repressions against the poor municipalities that should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux recited from one of his articles from 2010, explaining why violence in Rio is not the criteria specified by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio will also result in serious consequences for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This calls on the state to use means and means that are typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an invisible point in the landscape and becomes an object for "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas in Rio will continue to suffer.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is a week ago that the police declare the mountain with the Favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence, this incident happened as headlines: an orchard died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the ensuing civil war many Syrian cities suffer from a brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victory Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The region East Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians to live.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these rebel areas have been besieged by rebel areas outside Damascus, which led to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as "food-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and run the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not part of the traditional food planted in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, told the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2815">125 families are planning to broaden the plantation of mushrooms, Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the Constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around â¬12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday 4th September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started the "production of fungal seeds from the regions" before they checked out their quality and, if they are suitable for consumption.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities in Portugal on October 21 and called for justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the fact that the government cried out for three days in solidarity with the victims for three days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Brandies were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 explosions of fire that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal - an area of the size of the Lisbon district.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness: there are only in 4 districts no fire.</seg>

<seg id="2845">The aim of the Saturday protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why civil protection was unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2847">JoÃ£o Soveral, Portugal's Confederation, declared PÃºblico:</seg>
<seg id="2848">After PedrÃ³gÃ£o, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did this nowhere: there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"" "in the forest of Leiria, a similar tragedy would have happened as in June, as the streets were closed very late." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2851">In addition, construction permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned.</seg>
<seg id="2852">A far reaching proposal for the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities that saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments.</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a slackening of the law allowing the construction activity from fall to fall, if the applicant had a means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," JoÃ£o Sorval continues in the same article of the paper PÃºblico.</seg>
<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees of easily inflammable wood, like in a vicious circle, still expand upon fires of this kind.</seg>
<seg id="2855">These problems are due to the fact that the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when inhabitants were looking for information or trying to contact their relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided information to the population: it took advantage of its own civil protection data with the help of the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by the developer JoÃ£o Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial at this fateful weekend in October that the servers did not stand up to the onslaught of the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million visitors.</seg>

<seg id="2876">Even if his mother did not say that at that time, she knew she wouldn't see her son for a long time - maybe even more.</seg>
<seg id="2877">At dawn, the boy was supposed to break open.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, the leader of the Hazara-dominated Hezb-e-Wahrebate party, had just been killed by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenseless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of the Hazara, came ever closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Ashark found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">He worked in a coal mine for a few years. the work was heavy and made him ill.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar which were heavier than himself, to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">Back then, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really tough," "" "said Ashark in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site on which we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">"" "there were no services and no heating there. we hanged nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Ashark left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and landed on a small, uninhabited island of Greece.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Ashark joined Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time Ashark was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to the needy twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "" "" "true, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high willingness to pay. however, it is true that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "the human rights organization Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system" "" "suffers from a general lack of transparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the vast majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "" "special admission centres" "". "they are improvised centres in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially filed an application for asylum - which may result after the registration of the asylum application for months.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then people who have no money for accommodation depend either on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">And there was also Ashark.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his untamed lifestyles helped Ashark to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After having worked several years in the construction industry for several years, Ashark put his whole savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This was so good that after a while he opened a second hostel and a quick snack.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Ashark Baratis "success story is now the topic of" Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy "(German:" behind Venetian Luxury - a Hazara in Italy ") by director Amin Wahidi.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have arisen, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were praised even in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his Orient Experience restaurant, where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy by the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek dishes.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">However, Ashara's goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy sector and retail, and aim to return to the country which he had to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"where there is a risk, there are also opportunities," says Ashark with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan.</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>

<seg id="2925">"" "Ashark also forged plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques." "" "they can sell their crop surplus in the market and improve their financial situation," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development towards a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end there are stability and prosperity.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Ashark has made this journey himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this path.</seg>
<seg id="2928">Netizen Report: Egypt's draft bill enables shutdown of social networks Mahmoud Abu Zaid, aka Shawkan, in detention for more than 900 days.</seg>
<seg id="2929">He reported on the clearance of the camp Raba'a el Adaweya in Cairo, protesting against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo of @ Ciluna27 shared on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, wins and emerging trends in global Internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that suggests that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration with a government authority.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users should register to use social networks within six months of their successful legislative decision on the authority's website, stating their full name and ID number.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who missed this step could be sentenced to six months "imprisonment or the final payment of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was applied by sixty Members of Parliament, is currently present to the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">In May, another member of the Bundestag reached a legislative proposal that would introduce heavier punishments to the insult of the president or a high official.</seg>
<seg id="2937">"" "" "" "under Egyptian law, the envy of the president as well as state institutions is already punishable." "" "under the legislative act, such action would be punished with prison and fines," "" "said judicial experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy." ""</seg>
<seg id="2938">"" "" "" "if the law is passed, this can mean up to three years" "" "imprisonment" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2939">In addition, this would underpin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger anyway for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who shot Egyptian policemen while exercising violence against demonstrators who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the preselection of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan was waiting for four years in jail for a trial date, just as more than 700 protest participants had been arrested for the same incident.</seg>
<seg id="2942">His trial, which was scheduled for 20 May, was recently postponed because the prison management failed to bring the accused from prison to the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatening the death penalty on the basis of one, so many human rights groups agree, bogus burden of, among other things, arms ownership, illegal assembly, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza spoke to the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were charged for their coverage of the pro-Morsi sitting blockade on the Raba'a Al-Adaviya square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishments of the journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly, who were also arrested for the aforementioned incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists questioned about leaked documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May Tunisian authorities spent six hours listening to Sami Ben Gresbia, who is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gresbia was mainly interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan, explicitly supported a controversial bill that would accuse businessmen and during the former regime of dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali of the corruption if they return all illegally received funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document, published on 21 April on the Nawaat website, sheds light on how the presidential plans for the support of the draft bill look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the mention of his sources under the name of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press Code, which assures journalists the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he appeared as a witness in the Regional Court in Tunis on 9 May.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force users of social media to submit their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new rules of the information bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">It is also stated in the regulations that registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts assume that herewith the elimination of anonymous comments is to be achieved in social networks. it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to only selectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"" "according to Roscomnadzor, WeChat failed to register as an" "" "organizer of the dissemination of information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2961">This designation is part of a year of 2014, thanks to which the Russian Government is carrying out a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services responsible for the removal of content and to force them upon request to suspend user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Websites like Vcontacts and Odnullniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the image board 2.ch.hk, the e-mail service Mail.Ru and dozens of other services belong to these websites.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court features ban Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the ban on Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia admins refused to delete two English-language articles, the data, Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications announced that the site had been closed because it was" "" "an information resource that cooperates with groups to address a political defamation campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey blocked the website completely. it is, among other things, China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">UK can't stop sniffing</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week of leaked documents, the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor real-time communications and to install Backdoor uting programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal, but has left out other technology companies and the civilian population outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until 19 May. reactions and proposals from members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
