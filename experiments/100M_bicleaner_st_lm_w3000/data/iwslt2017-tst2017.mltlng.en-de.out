that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans .
it is however another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA had literally handed over blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like this chapter ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years , the government has been fighting against cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and to spy on journalists .
according to the First constitutional law , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many cour@@ a@@ geous repor@@ ters had done before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison .
from 2007 to 2015 Ris@@ en was at risk of going to prison .
but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened .
suddenly , although for years , they indicated that it would be essential in their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped to ris@@ ons .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
instead of sh@@ utting down and bringing tears to the testimony , that could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly raised his phone bill ,
just like his e @-@ mail , financial and banking information , his credit return , and even travel references with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens put@@ ative source .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers at his arrival , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government down@@ gra@@ ded too much of its work .
from September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we therefore put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but just as technology enables the government to circum@@ vent the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand .
today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Ris@@ en had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Anywhere , an open source nar@@ ration system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I work .
instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the Washington Post here .
here you can upload documents or send information , as with any usual contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access .
so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is however only a small part of the whole , in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately governments around the world are developing new sp@@ ying technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se all of us .
it is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to put mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower ,
who knows about gri@@ ev@@ ances in the care of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers who alarm the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ In@@ sider who warns us before the next financial crisis .
after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money have hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer from Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ ig@@ ned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has shaped box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems to be far away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should that be done to us ?
but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads .
and that affects all of us .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal .
in the whole world , media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , can be used by a few to hide and obsc@@ ure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bi@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the United States .
presum@@ ably because up to now there have been no prominent Americans who have come to this sc@@ andal in these revelations .
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
but thanks to the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have ties in the US .
in fact , in some U.S. countries , less information is needed , less information is required to set up a company than to get a library card .
this type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
frau@@ d@@ sters have allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here with Global Wit@@ ness , we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it actually work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring a suspi@@ cious money to the United States to buy a house , yacht , private jet .
it really shock@@ ed us that all of us had made proposals to a lawyer from our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as a single case .
it &apos;s not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not about a single top politicians , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may sound very non@@ sense as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
over the past few years , we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies .
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
since then , the EU has captured in central registers at the national level , who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it .
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties have dra@@ fted a bill in both parliam@@ ent@@ arians , but this does not make the progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how this Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally .
for us in Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use the laws to end this type of in@@ transparency . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency that allows now this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after completing my design studies , I bought back yard sales .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me enthusias@@ tically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what do I do now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he &apos;d go to peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; u@@ h , how do you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at night I was lying in bed , star@@ ing at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I rock up there ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what if he is crazy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I got such a fear that I went out of bed , cu@@ dd@@ ly at the toes of the door , and closed my bedroom door .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in touch .
the work of art he bought from me today hangs in his class@@ rooms . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as host . it completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with me .
let &apos;s take a leap forward , two years later ...
I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate dra@@ gs out and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it super , and we too .
I &apos;m sure to taste our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets completely different because we made them for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and dropped the door into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed .
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ qu@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it .
so we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors you close when you come by .
over the Internet , they can invite wild people to stay with them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
no one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
if you have a problem , you can concentrate on the things that you can do well . we could design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before .
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we asp@@ ire to .
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
share your locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this quiet touch of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
most guests feel like they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile now ?
could you please declare on Twitter that he is running for the office of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to share with you some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
what if your neighbor first presented himself with his name ; if he had told you where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you have 150 assessments that everyone says : &quot; he can really hold on very well un@@ locked mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait for both hosts and guest to leave their assessments before we put them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence .
not surprisingly , we trust people most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case through assessments .
if you have less than three assessments , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation dis@@ solves com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted love .
we also learned that confidence is dependent on how much money is available .
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if you tell too little , like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hi ! &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; Great art@@ works in your home ! I &apos;ll go on holiday with my family . &quot;
how can I create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics you should write something .
our whole company is built on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disman@@ tle these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people take advantage of our offer .
you can see three things .
first of all : incredibly good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need which had not been met before .
for us , the business is running very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have rav@@ aged apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there &apos;s nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves .
fortunately , of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction was ever a problem .
for people trust each other rightly .
when trust works , it can create wonderful things .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save life even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive one in your own car to the hospital , when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions ?
it is about economic trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just to mention it won &apos;t do justice to the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything .
when you travel nowadays , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
what if journeys were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if in any place you have visited , a group there will be waiting for a thorough re@@ plen@@ ishment and show you a neighborhood next to a tur@@ pent@@ ine neighborhood of which you have never heard of it ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments on the basis of sharing ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing a common share ?
I imagine cities that allow society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking spaces belonging to the government ,
were now offered to residents . students who were looking for a place to stay ,
were given to people whose children were moved out . incu@@ b@@ ator programs were started ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or host .
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality also existed before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why did our work just work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
down@@ right overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da goes past me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us if it had this big impact , I wonder why we can use design soon .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double espresso , with cream extra .
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a car@@ rot @-@ fitness fan@@ atic ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslim .
but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born like that .
I decided to do so .
when I was 17 , I made the decision to ou@@ ch me .
no , not as a hom@@ os@@ exual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you op@@ press yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was : at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence for me , compared to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;@@ an .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted , and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;@@ an .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
have you ever felt that someone you perceive you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ?
that &apos;s how it feels .
later I married and started , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian American Dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember where they were there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking news &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was smoke , planes flew into buildings , people j@@ umped out of the buildings .
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should one do something like that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; &quot; &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mec@@ ca bom@@ bed ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Oh my God .
it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u , the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects .
on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and begin construction studies .
I remember -- when we were driving sil@@ ently -- as deep as it went into my seat , and I was the first time feared to be recognized as Muslims .
we moved to our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organizations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rem@@ ain in well @-@ lit regions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not be sam@@ pled . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed in the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard about attacks on Muslims or by people that were held to be Muslims in the open and suggested .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have rejected the people &apos;s anger at the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to explain oneself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today , we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when will we get rid of them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are sen@@ sel@@ ess because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ class and Olympic athletes .
will the closure of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking spaces available , but not stopping the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other fai@@ ths , and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington , DC area told me recently : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radic@@ alisation it has been found that he begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or belief .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran .
as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like IS .
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology behind their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you have a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke she sil@@ enced her and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her fur@@ y , she was a prime objective for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m restored the connection with God and its church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world .
what she learned in the Mos@@ que was preventing her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
one study -- actually several neuro@@ logical studies -- show that if we fear , at least three things happen .
we are more likely to accept an author@@ itarian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you see when the mood of Muslims flow@@ ed up@@ stairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two elections .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected .
it can indeed be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has rational and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it as the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts all of us .
in the assignment of collective debt it is not only about having to explain oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented , promising , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when has such a young man come out of my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered them , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon .
he went to De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be fatal not only im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or did we stay safe at home ?
we discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us , as it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely practice our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled crowd were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had dar@@ ed courage and sympathy to panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or you will join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you hold a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man with a drau@@ ght , work in a noble think tank , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
looking at Muslims all over the world , and I did this with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want normal things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want jobs and they want to live in peace .
so I am in no way an exception .
when people like an exception appear to rule , then the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide .
before entering into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes .
by connecting flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space .
you can also build self @-@ loading structures independently .
they have learned to bear loads , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know where the mobile objects are located in the room .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine the calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; external commands are available at the highest level e. g. &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; land &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called stern starter
a plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations .
in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay . okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that come to the core of the matter .
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying machines , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ ic , the mechanically most simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bow , no other actuators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanically simple , there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room .
however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern window . to get it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right if everyone watches me is small , so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening .
if the mono sco@@ op is an exercise in fer@@ ocity , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this surplus ?
they see that it is just symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
in this way he receives the excess capacity ,
move in space in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even rot@@ ates .
of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some can be seen in models , the rest is taught directly when flying .
let &apos;s look at that .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable .
this machine here consists of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance Quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller drops , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making half @-@ f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took custom@@ ary Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each of them weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ ps them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where it is and is self @-@ controlled . that &apos;s why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine on the outside would like to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act .
it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that creative , clever creatures are allowed to form them in such a spectacular manner .
the fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other faster and faster in a very distant gal@@ axy ; they converted the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second .
for this short moment they gle@@ amed bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally talk about black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let &apos;s arrange the events in a timely manner .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell life on earth .
since then the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group especially cour@@ a@@ geous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravit@@ ational waves , which are caused by colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ omet@@ er- gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o could be increased significantly , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was started for a final test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gravit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes rus@@ hed through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the f@@ arewell to my death @-@ sick father .
the fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves from black holes and their signals meas@@ urable by observ@@ atories like lig@@ o for 23 years . but what are gravit@@ ational waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ pp@@ le in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other .
to illustrate , lec@@ turers in courses on the theory of rel@@ ativity often perform a truly al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretch and dust , stretch and dust . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and smo@@ ked at the arrival of the waves . the el@@ on@@ gation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that is 20 zer@@ os following the comm@@ a followed by a 1 .
with a five kilometer long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text about gravity
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive , and with the support of the public , all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne released this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott like to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength , much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phone .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
for sounds , this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you :
for example , your child &apos;s face .
instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height , rhythm and volume to close the story behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now just Alice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
with them we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space .
but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we trans@@ mu@@ te wave patterns into sound , we can literally listen to the universe .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p !
turn the two bodies very fast , you hear the same chir@@ p with an additional ton@@ er change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu Yi@@ wu Yi@@ wu Yi@@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , engraved in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I &apos;ll never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s sound &#93; No one knows what to listen to , recognize this as the sound of -- SH : ... two black holes each with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer .
AA : let us briefly think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est bodies in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circle one hundred times per second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we have heard it .
this is the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way of exploring the universe , as it has never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space we can &apos;t see -- practical or in principle -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I &apos;d like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ a .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
but the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never go through because these are op@@ a@@ que .
gravit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate the iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to research the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it because the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow .
using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in All things that we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run , which we had not expected .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , such as Lig@@ o , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from pre@@ historic times . the black holes are , so to speak , the sour cher@@ bones for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as cour@@ a@@ geous as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and cir@@ c@@ ality of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried out an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a year , I would say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be on TV live ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start the show ?
no , no , no , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of was removing my fear .
my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life has changed .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , is called all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my bill of bill . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
a new life attitude in my family . from then on , I s@@ wore to always play with them as soon as you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I am very proud .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; yes &quot; thing to play with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am an author . I think things out , awaken you to life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
I watch television , in great style .
in this season I &apos;m responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts simultaneously in production , four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV ,
350 million dollars for a season .
in America , my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million spectators .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts I have created myself and not just produced , so on top . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around bon@@ fires and tell my stories .
four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires burning around the world .
do you know who is doing this ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I say it because I know what you think if the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; author &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; falls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I tell you , so that all of you who work so hard , whether you run a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously when I talk about work , so you understand that I &apos;m not just walking around the computer and imagin@@ ative , and it &apos;s true when I say that it &apos;s not dre@@ aming about a dream job .
it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears .
I work a lot , hard and I love it .
when I am immersed in the work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is as if I set up troops , as I painted on a canvas .
as a result of a high tone , run a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
it is creative , mechanical , ti@@ ring and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when the job is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever .
many people accept when I explain the sums to them that I talk over writing that writing gives me joy .
don &apos;t get me wrong , that &apos;s what she does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began with the television production , when I started working and working and making , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy . the bu@@ zz !
the bu@@ zz@@ ing is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the bu@@ zz is music . the bu@@ zz is light and air .
the voice of God is in my ear .
and if you have such a bu@@ zz then you cannot strive for great@@ ness .
the feeling of not being able to do otherwise than to strive for size no matter what price .
this is called the sum .
or perhaps it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work at the same time , the more I am writing history , the more expectations there is .
the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing .
I like this h@@ um . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the bu@@ zz . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this sum@@ ming ?
and then the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burnt out .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write to my n@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the tot@@ als ceased .
the engine &apos;s bu@@ zz@@ ing was silent .
I didn &apos;t love my job any more . the engine was off .
the tot@@ als did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , do not deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a showing Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing I was .
so what do you do if what you do is suddenly ban@@ ishing the work you love ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know , some may think , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ail yourself , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do , you do , you do , you do what you do , be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz is stopped , who is then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then my &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; southern state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asks me a question . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say No , when two things become aware of me :
&quot; &quot; &quot; first , I have to say Yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no one more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when did this happen ?
I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and mo@@ urn my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mo@@ m , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nothing special about this .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ el@@ iness and in the absence of h@@ um , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out .
I am focused .
I am quiet .
the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist .
everything that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons , and the song in which it &apos;s going to go , or whatever the girl acqu@@ ires in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so scar@@ ce that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door rises and an energy boost comes in .
and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the bu@@ zz is slowly coming back .
no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a bu@@ zz@@ ing .
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the titanium frame , that &apos;s just the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the tot@@ als is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real bu@@ zz depends on the love .
the tot@@ als are the electricity that comes from the lust of life .
real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , because what God told me I am a Titan ?
it is just love .
we all need a bit more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I am doing this as a rule so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice if I want to hear the h@@ um again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t seem to play in such a way as to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at work than at home .
this admission is painful , because what kind of person does he prefer to be as a home ?
well , I .
&quot; &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Titan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
we run around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I always hook up my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I wonder : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can do it too ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you .
maybe you think me nai@@ ve , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it &apos;s wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit will be replaced .
and talk to my teen@@ ie girl for a whole 15 minutes with me , am I mother of the year .
it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for more .
anyone can spend 15 minutes on the track , even in a bad mood day !
15 minutes a little !
no mobile phone , no linen , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are in it !
my children are my oasis of wellbeing , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the bu@@ zz of having a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and keep it .
I am not perfect in it . I fail and I have victories . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stands for everything I have given up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes a bit , why not take full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without games .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy po@@ urs in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul .
I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my bu@@ zz now .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the clearer my head .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high clay , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the other , the right bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , consistent , naked and new attitude towards life in me spreads . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m a writer . I think things out , I &apos;ll catch you to life .
this is part of the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability .
this is probably the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures .
certainly they have heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; depth brain stimulation . &quot; here , one im@@ planted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ on circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves .
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is to restore the brain .
in my opinion , we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was chief physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
they have to imagine that in the case of skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas the brain sw@@ ells and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life one has to reduce cran@@ ial pressure .
for this , sometimes a part of s@@ wollen brain mass must be removed .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist .
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the surroundings in order to prosp@@ er .
that &apos;s exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François managed to do so .
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they quickly divide .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
we saw a new strange cell population , which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage , they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they keep us ?
we do not know this .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so certain .
but one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step , we reim@@ proved them at the withdrawal point of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we integrate these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are reim@@ pl@@ ying the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes .
in the first scenario , we imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we inserted an injury and reim@@ pl@@ ab@@ ated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we were able to observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ plant@@ ated .
the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells we d@@ yed in in vitro , in culture .
of course we couldn &apos;t stop there .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual skill task .
they had to take pellets from a tray .
they did it very well .
when they had achieved a stable skill level , we hurt the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex .
as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more .
just as it would happen to humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just like after a stroke .
the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just like the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left side you see the monkey who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance before injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
see now as we reim@@ pl@@ ete the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation .
I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream still is to implant it in humans .
I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giuss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely .
of course , the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results you have to fill about two kil@@ os of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc .
J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authorities allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and assess if it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
then you have to apply this to a multic@@ entre study .
you have to prove at first that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
BG : and that it &apos;s safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider it un@@ changeable .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in fact democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I made it unmistak@@ ably clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends who told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed if they change anything .
at this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , China &apos;s Communist Party and even the Euro@@ group are wrong , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy .
for without democracy our societies are mixed , our future is ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste , I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which threat@@ ens our economies at present .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Twin To@@ oth Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which th@@ rows his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all recognize the mountain of debt ,
but few know his twin .
a mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , which , however , are too sc@@ ary to invest where it would be productive and income , with which one could bear the debt @-@ berg and also produce all the things humanity desper@@ ately needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy .
I call them two numbers .
in the past 3 months , in the USA , in England and the euro area , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
$ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion sounds like a lot of money to compare it with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars , which at the same time comp@@ eted in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did nothing to infl@@ ate the stock markets and raise real estate prices .
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stagn@@ ating wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the U.S. , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low aggregate demand that , as in a continuous loop , encourages the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who , out of fear , the prophecy of the ro@@ cket could be true that his son would kill him if he grew up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him .
this is my hatred with capitalism --
its extremely wast@@ eful nature . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
so is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed , what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
but it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy on the basis of these exclu@@ sions .
the decisive thing about the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive that they granted them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same vote wei@@ ghting in questions of the state &apos;s concerns .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy hasn &apos;t lasted long --
like a candle that lights up very bright , it is quickly burnt out .
however , today &apos;s liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious Revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution .
while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a by@@ law for rulers .
for liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone .
in our modern demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and business began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two is taking place by gradually under@@ mining politics and deprived it of it .
do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
there is no degeneration of their DNA .
it is because today one can be in the government and still not in power , because the power is immig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is about like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors , who have decim@@ ated so sustain@@ ably the animals they feed on , that they star@@ ve at the end .
similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it is har@@ ming itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are depreci@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls and the directors of corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their businesses .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind .
if that is true , it is obvious that we must re@@ unite the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Mar@@ xi@@ an left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor reg@@ ain a position just like in ancient Athens without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste more subli@@ me , and social conflicts lower , like it -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China will come .
so we must re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the sectors of business and politics , and thereby ensure that we are democr@@ ati@@ sing the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyper@@ car bureaucracy which makes the film &quot; matrix &quot; appear as a documentation .
the question is not , therefore , whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that of &quot; Matrix , &quot; or by something similar to society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which people are serving human beings , or in a high @-@ tech version of ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks about the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation , I would like to briefly mention some examples .
in the area of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and where your capital follows you from one place to the next , from one company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working , is the property of those currently working in the company .
then all revenues come from capital and revenue , and the concept of wage labor is completely out@@ dated .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work therein , and employees who work there , but the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency backed by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all mankind .
imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John Ma@@ yn@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world I describe is simultaneously liber@@ alized where they prefer privileged individuals , and Marxist , because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nesi@@ an , global Key@@ nesi@@ an .
but above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will awaken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or will we sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide politically together .
it is in our hands and we do it more democr@@ atically .
thank you .
father of Father Giuss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if something I &apos;ve just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economics is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which is called Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is correct , Marx is definitely relevant ,
as Hay@@ ek , therefore , I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that is why I am also totally confused .
BG : indeed , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t get confused , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very gre@@ ek , kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what to keep from the west &apos;s point of view .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone .
in a sense , if I am allowed to say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that &apos;s a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill --
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
what one can now observe in China resembles much of the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
China now acc@@ using to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century sm@@ ells great after hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back for the first half of the year six months later ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing , as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good@@ bye to our self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the per@@ sever@@ ing den@@ ial that a massive destruction line proc@@ eeded through the euro@@ zone and continues to be mas@@ sively under threat to the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was , by the way , the first suggestion that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have also chosen den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , it might be delayed for a while , but when the change occurs it happens to be ab@@ rupt and destructive .
BG : what changes do you see ahead of ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- serious ...
if there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , he has made no mistake , it is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the request to renew the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders &apos; pages to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that for 5 years they have been carrying out a disa@@ strous program in Greece .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is worse than during the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Depression &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody from the tro@@ ika of the credi@@ tors who imposed this policy on us was saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you still seem to be pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , according to what it seems to me , it will also be bear@@ able for the future of Europeans , as well as the non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for having been at TED .
Y@@ V : thank you .
Roy Price has never heard most of them , although he is likely to be responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy has met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studio ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slender , has a hed@@ geho@@ g and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking out the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard fought industry .
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
he has to find shows that are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are right on this curve .
this curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this review .
if your show is rated at nine and above , this is a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what &apos;s going on at this end of the curve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy Price is not worried about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to under@@ mine &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he gets more thoughts about the middle sco@@ und@@ rel , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
the pressure is available , and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch everyone for free .
and if Amazon publishes vain things for free , do you acc@@ use it , right ?
millions of viewers watch these episodes .
but they don &apos;t know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything .
you capture when you start the show when you pause , what parts you jump over or look again .
they collect millions of data in order to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team were working .
about the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always on the look@@ out to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different .
rather than hosting a competition , he and his team have watched the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , i.e. the ratings they give to the shows , their course , what shows they like , etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series on a sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has thus landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
it has two very competitive , data @-@ sav@@ vy companies .
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you make , you should be able to make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you optimize it by very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work so this is a bit frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time where we access more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software . come in touch , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is carried out or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the most experienced companies are wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that by analy@@ zing data analysis breaks of flu , the worst kind , they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it just didn &apos;t work , this was another sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nature &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
in spite of all these errors , data increasingly streams into decisions of life -- at work , in the law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy .
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first , disman@@ tle this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items ; as a second , put the individual parts together to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : taking apart and putting together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all have it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete , in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence wherever they belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience , what they would otherwise have been unable to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; from it did not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first when they comp@@ eted for TV ideas than they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is telling us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
it &apos;s also called Magic 8 Ball . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will fight it out later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , where I should have listened to the ball afterwards .
however , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with a little more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
in the end it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn .
and I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions , be an expert in what you are doing and take risks .
because in the end it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
