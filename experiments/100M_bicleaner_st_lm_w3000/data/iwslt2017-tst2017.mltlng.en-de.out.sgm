<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA illegally listened to phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is however another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA had literally handed over blueprints to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like this chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years, the government has been fighting against cracks and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning Whistleblower and to spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First constitutional law, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they give.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters had done before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015 Risen was at risk of going to prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the process, something unusual happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although for years, they indicated that it would be essential in their case, the government's demands were dropped to risons.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of shutting down and bringing tears to the testimony, that could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, secretly raised his phone bill,</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail, financial and banking information, his credit return, and even travel references with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens putative source.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers at his arrival, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government downgraded too much of its work.</seg>
<seg id="26">From September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "" "" "we therefore put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional law, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone." ""</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as technology enables the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there is communication software that has not yet existed when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureAnywhere, an open source narration system for whistleblower, originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an email, go to a news site like the Washington Post here.</seg>
<seg id="33">Here you can upload documents or send information, as with any usual contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server where only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is however only a small part of the whole, in order to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spying technologies that jeopardise all of us.</seg>
<seg id="38">It is important for us to ensure that not only technology experts such as Edward Snowden have a chance to put misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,</seg>
<seg id="39">Who knows about grievances in the care of soldiers and wants to report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers who alarm the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">After all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leak of history was published.] [the Panama Papers "revealed that rich and powerful] [enormous sums of money have hidden in tax havens].] [we asked Robert Palmer from Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has shaped box companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is alleged that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others waiting nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems to be far away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that be done to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">In the whole world, media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havens, can be used by a few to hide and obscure their assets -- something we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bids.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">Presumably because up to now there have been no prominent Americans who have come to this scandal in these revelations.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">But thanks to the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have ties in the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, in some U.S. countries, less information is needed, less information is required to set up a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Fraudsters have allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness, we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring a suspicious money to the United States to buy a house, yacht, private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all of us had made proposals to a lawyer from our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as a single case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It's not about a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "" "" "it's not about a single top politicians, involved in a scandal." ""</seg>
<seg id="80">"" "" "" "it's about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability." ""</seg>
<seg id="81">And to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior difficult." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">It may sound very nonsense as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years, we have seen more transparency regarding the owners of companies.</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">Since then, the EU has captured in central registers at the national level, who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it.</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties have drafted a bill in both parliamentarians, but this does not make the progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how this Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us in Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"" "" "" "we need ordinary people who will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind false companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who get up and say:" "" "intransparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use the laws to end this type of intransparency." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the intransparency that allows now this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after completing my design studies, I bought back yard sales.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "and I thought," "" "Oh, man!" ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "what do I do now?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he'd go to peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said:" "" "uh, how do you?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">"" "at night I was lying in bed, staring at the ceiling and thought," "" "Oh man! what did I rock up there?" ""</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">"" "what if he is crazy?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I went out of bed, cuddly at the toes of the door, and closed my bedroom door.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me today hangs in his classrooms. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as host. it completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">When I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with me.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap forward, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate drags out and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create it to transform fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk including a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure to taste our cheese-ham-omelets completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and dropped the door into the castle, Brian and I stared.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blequczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make a business concept out of it.</seg>
<seg id="138">So we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors you close when you come by.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can invite wild people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">No one who is still in comfort would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">If you have a problem, you can concentrate on the things that you can do well. we could design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of trust we aspire to.</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Share your locked mobile phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic that you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">Because the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger in his hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel like they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile now?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please declare on Twitter that he is running for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to share with you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor first presented himself with his name; if he had told you where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you have 150 assessments that everyone says: "he can really hold on very well unlocked mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait for both hosts and guest to leave their assessments before we put them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are in terms of age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Not surprisingly, we trust people most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add a person's reputation -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three assessments, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation dissolves commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted love.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that confidence is dependent on how much money is available.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "if you tell too little, like" "" "Hi!" "", "you don't get an answer." ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother" "" "-- -- the request is not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">So there is an optimal degree of openness, such as "Great artworks in your home! I'll go on holiday with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company is built on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dismantle these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take advantage of our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First of all: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need which had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is running very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have ravaged apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, of the 123 million overnight stays only a fraction was ever a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, it can create wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with enough hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save life even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital, when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing fit together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is about economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but it's just" "" "rental industry" "" "just to mention it won't do justice to the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">When you travel nowadays, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">What if journeys were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if in any place you have visited, a group there will be waiting for a thorough replenishment and show you a neighborhood next to a turpentine neighborhood of which you have never heard of it;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments on the basis of sharing?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing a common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that allow society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">This project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking spaces belonging to the government,</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered to residents. students who were looking for a place to stay,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or host.</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality also existed before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work just work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of confidence.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us if it had this big impact, I wonder why we can use design soon.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think that most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A carrot-fitness fanatic,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born like that.</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17, I made the decision to ouch me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>

<seg id="325">They know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are senseless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-class and Olympic athletes.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking spaces available, but not stopping the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other faiths, and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington, DC area told me recently: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation it has been found that he begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group believes that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or belief.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">As a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I believe that we have to do everything to stop a group like IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology behind their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you have a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scriptures." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was exactly the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke she silenced her and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her fury, she was a prime objective for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection with God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the Mosque was preventing her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neurological studies -- show that if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We are more likely to accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that when people submit messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they were more likely to have military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood of Muslims flowed upstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two elections.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror as I expected.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has rational and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it as the first, but the toxic air of fear hurts all of us.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collective debt it is not only about having to explain oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>

<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew.</seg>

<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and it was not an easy decision for us, as it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely practice our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled off my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled crowd were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had dared courage and sympathy to panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before entering into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft in the Frac Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flight devices achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-loading structures independently.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads, deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of possibility in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it is necessary to know where the mobile objects are located in the room.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine the calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "external commands are available at the highest level e. g." "" "start" "" "and" "" "land" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called stern starter</seg>
<seg id="422">A plane that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopter in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flying machine doesn't matter in which position the optimal position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that come to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of mobile parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that meet to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying machines, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospic, the mechanically most simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only one moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbow, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanically simple, there is a lot happening inside the interior so that it can fly stable and move anywhere in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">However, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern window. to get it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right if everyone watches me is small, so I show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the mono scoop is an exercise in ferocity, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this surplus?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is just symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way he receives the excess capacity,</seg>
<seg id="447">Move in space in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some can be seen in models, the rest is taught directly when flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine here consists of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance Quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller drops, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making half-flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took customary Micro-Quadcopter -- each of them weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equips them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where it is and is self-controlled. that's why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think out new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine on the outside would like to be a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us lies the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that creative, clever creatures are allowed to form them in such a spectacular manner.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive industrial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other faster and faster in a very distant galaxy; they converted the mass of three suns into pure energy in a tenth of a second.</seg>
<seg id="470">For this short moment they gleamed brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the whole known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally talk about black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let's arrange the events in a timely manner.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell life on earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer- gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo could be increased significantly, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was started for a final test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes rushed through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell to my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">The fruits of my life were basically the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes and their signals measurable by observatories like ligo for 23 years. but what are gravitational waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a ripple in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and put into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate, lecturers in courses on the theory of relativity often perform a truly albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dust, stretch and dust."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and smoked at the arrival of the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That is 20 zeros following the comma followed by a 1.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five kilometer long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of a nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"" "Mr. Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" "" "the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous." ""</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive, and with the support of the public, all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne released this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott like to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength, much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">For sounds, this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">For example, your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and height, rhythm and volume to close the story behind.</seg>
<seg id="514">"" "" "" "now just Alice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">With them we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transmute wave patterns into sound, we can literally listen to the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two bodies very fast, you hear the same chirp with an additional toner change. that sounds like: Wu-wu Yiwu Yiwu Yiwu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, engraved in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I'll never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's sound] No one knows what to listen to, recognize this as the sound of -- SH:... two black holes each with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us briefly think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest bodies in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circle one hundred times per second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way of exploring the universe, as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space we can't see -- practical or in principle -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I'd like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernova.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">But the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational-waves penetrate the iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to research the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it because the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in All things that we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run, which we had not expected.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, such as Ligo, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the sour cherbones for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as courageous as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circality of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried out an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"" "for a year, I would say," "" "Yes!" "" "in front of which I was afraid." ""</seg>
<seg id="556">No matter if it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say "yes."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be on TV live?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of was removing my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life has changed.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly kind. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, is called all" "" "kitten" "" "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my bill of bill."</seg>
<seg id="572">"" "she once asked her if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new life attitude in my family. from then on, I swore to always play with them as soon as you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I am very proud.</seg>
<seg id="576">It has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family.</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the "yes" thing to play with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am an author. I think things out, awaken you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I watch television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this season I'm responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment contains hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, i.e. every nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts simultaneously in production, four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America, my TV series run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series in 256 regions are running in 67 languages for 30 million spectators.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts I have created myself and not just produced, so on top. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around bonfires and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires burning around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"" "I say it because I know what you think if the word" "" "author" "" "falls." ""</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you, so that all of you who work so hard, whether you run a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously when I talk about work, so you understand that I'm not just walking around the computer and imaginative, and it's true when I say that it's not dreaming about a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It is all a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work a lot, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I am immersed in the work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops, as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result of a high tone, run a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">It is creative, mechanical, tiring and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the job is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzzing sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I explain the sums to them that I talk over writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't get me wrong, that's what she does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began with the television production, when I started working and working and making, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy. the buzz!</seg>
<seg id="618">The buzzing is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The voice of God is in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a buzz then you cannot strive for greatness.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being able to do otherwise than to strive for size no matter what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sum.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work at the same time, the more I am writing history, the more expectations there is.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to be successful, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high clay, the buzzing, the buzzing, the buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this summing?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Overhauled, overloaded, exaggerated, burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzzing stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mother is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there, but you can write to my nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says:" "" "kitten, I want to go to Shonda Land." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1 when the totals ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The engine's buzzing was silent.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The totals did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, do not delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a showing Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do is suddenly banishing the work you love?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know, some may think," "" "Hail yourself, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do, you do, you do, you do what you do, be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz when the buzz is stopped, who is then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">If the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">"" "and then my" "" "southern state waitress" "" "asks me a question." ""</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late, and she says:" "" "mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say No, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"" "first, I have to say Yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no one more" "" "kittens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I'm Titan and mourn my buzz, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says:" "" "mom, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">Nothing special about this.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and in the absence of hum, I can't do anything except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The land I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">Everything that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons, and the song in which it's going to go, or whatever the girl acquires in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so scarce that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door rises and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a buzzing.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The buzzing, the buzzing, the titanium frame, that's just the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The totals is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The totals are the electricity that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">Real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">Real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, because what God told me I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a bit more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I am doing this as a rule so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice if I want to hear the hum again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't seem to play in such a way as to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what kind of person does he prefer to be as a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">"" "honestly, I call myself" "" "Titan" "" "--" ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We run around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I always hook up my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the buzzing of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I wonder: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you think me naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It's wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit will be replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">And talk to my teenie girl for a whole 15 minutes with me, am I mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">It is only 15 minutes, there is no need for more.</seg>
<seg id="752">Anyone can spend 15 minutes on the track, even in a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a little!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile phone, no linen, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my oasis of wellbeing, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the buzz of having a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,</seg>

<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy pours in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the hum, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more.</seg>

<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor trying to improve the nerve functions by various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">Certainly they have heard of one of the most well-known, the "depth brain stimulation." here, one implanted a electrode deep in the brain in order to influence the neuron circuits in such a way that the neurological function improves.</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion, we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was chief physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in the case of skull-brain traumas the brain swells and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life one has to reduce cranial pressure.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this, sometimes a part of swollen brain mass must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">To grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children who are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the surroundings in order to prosper.</seg>
<seg id="823">That's exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François managed to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can turn into any cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they quickly divide.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new strange cell population, which looked like stem cells but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage, they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they keep us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find them close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so certain.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step, we reimproved them at the withdrawal point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we integrate these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we are reimplying the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario, we imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we inserted an injury and reimplabated exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplantated.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells we dyed in in vitro, in culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we couldn't stop there.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual skill task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they had achieved a stable skill level, we hurt the motor skills range in the motor cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">As a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand any more.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen to humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just like after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">The patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just like the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his level of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left side you see the monkey who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance before injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">See now as we reimplete the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were very exciting results for us too.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implant it in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope I can show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do that." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what are the biggest obstacles before you can start clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results you have to fill about two kilos of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes until someone can come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authorities allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and assess if it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">Then you have to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You have to prove at first that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider it unchangeable.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great neighbor in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"" "" "" "in fact democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I made it unmistakably clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who told me that democracy would be abolished if they change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, China's Communist Party and even the Eurogroup are wrong, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defenceless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">For without democracy our societies are mixed, our future is bleak and our great new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste, I would like to point out an interesting contradiction which threatens our economies at present.</seg>
<seg id="915">"" "I call it the" "" "Twin Tooth Paradox." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="916">A top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which throws his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all recognize the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few know his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of unused cash which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, which, however, are too scary to invest where it would be productive and income, with which one could bear the debt-berg and also produce all the things humanity desperately needs, for example "green" energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">In the past 3 months, in the USA, in England and the euro area, 3.4 trillion US dollars were invested in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">$3.4 trillion sounds like a lot of money to compare it with the $5.1 trillion dollars, which at the same time competed in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did nothing to inflate the stock markets and raise real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the U.S., Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low aggregate demand that, as in a continuous loop, encourages the pessimism of investors who, out of fear, the prophecy of the rocket could be true that his son would kill him if he grew up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily causes the circumstances causing the body to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hatred with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">Its extremely wasteful nature. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">So is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed, what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian Democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy on the basis of these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive that they granted them the right to political co-determination with the same vote weighting in questions of the state's concerns.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy hasn't lasted long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that lights up very bright, it is quickly burnt out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, today's liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious Revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a bylaw for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a more democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our modern democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and business began, a relentless struggle between the two is taking place by gradually undermining politics and deprived it of it.</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">There is no degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today one can be in the government and still not in power, because the power is immigrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators, who have decimated so sustainably the animals they feed on, that they starve at the end.</seg>
<seg id="947">Similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it is harming itself by the self-created economic crisis. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are depreciated, the overall economic demand falls and the directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their businesses.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind.</seg>
<seg id="949">If that is true, it is obvious that we must reunite the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxian left had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor regain a position just like in ancient Athens without creating new types of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste more sublime, and social conflicts lower, like it -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China will come.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we must redesign the economy and reunite the sectors of business and politics, and thereby ensure that we are democratising the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hypercar bureaucracy which makes the film "matrix" appear as a documentation.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not, therefore, whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements which he has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to that of "Matrix," or by something similar to society in "Star Trek," in which people are serving human beings, or in a high-tech version of ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks about the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "Matrix" -like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation, I would like to briefly mention some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the area of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and where your capital follows you from one place to the next, from one company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working, is the property of those currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues come from capital and revenue, and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work therein, and employees who work there, but the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies would have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency backed by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all mankind.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the Cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and every government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"" "" "" "today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe is simultaneously liberalized where they prefer privileged individuals, and Marxist, because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or will we sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide politically together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it more democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Father of Father Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if something I've just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economics is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which is called Larry Summers as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is correct, Marx is definitely relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">As Hayek, therefore, I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that is why I am also totally confused.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: indeed, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't get confused, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very greek, kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what to keep from the west's point of view.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"" "" "" "in our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy." ""</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of the economy -- is a completely democratic zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a sense, if I am allowed to say so provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that's a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What one can now observe in China resembles much of the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">China now accusing to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century smells great after hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experiences as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back for the first half of the year six months later?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing, as we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say goodbye to our self-complacency, and the persevering denial that a massive destruction line proceeded through the eurozone and continues to be massively under threat to the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- which was, by the way, the first suggestion that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have also chosen denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, it might be delayed for a while, but when the change occurs it happens to be abrupt and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you see ahead of?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as a finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- serious...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a finance minister or any minister who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he has made no mistake, it is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request to renew the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders' pages to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions that ran through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that for 5 years they have been carrying out a disastrous program in Greece.</seg>

<seg id="1038">Roy Price has never heard most of them, although he is likely to be responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy has met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior employee at Amazon Studio,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slender, has a hedgehog and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "films, TV, technology, tacos." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking out the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows that are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are right on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the assessment of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows received this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is rated at nine and above, this is a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like "Breaking Bad," "Game of Thrones," "The Wire" -- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks: "where are there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"" "on the left side, here at this end, shows like" "" "Toddlers and Tiaras" "" "-- -- that should tell you enough what's going on at this end of the curve." ""</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price is not worried about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to undermine "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He gets more thoughts about the middle scoundrel, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is available, and of course it is the first time that Amazon makes such a thing, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch everyone for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon publishes vain things for free, do you accuse it, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">But they don't know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who take up everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You capture when you start the show when you pause, what parts you jump over or look again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data in order to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican U.S. senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"" "yes," "" "Alpha House" "", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good." ""</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team were working.</seg>
<seg id="1073">About the same time at another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always on the lookout to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Rather than hosting a competition, he and his team have watched the available data on the Netflix audience, i.e. the ratings they give to the shows, their course, what shows they like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series on a senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has thus landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">It has two very competitive, data-savvy companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you make, you should be able to make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You optimize it by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work so this is a bit frightening, because we live in a time where we access more and more to statistics in order to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope no one in this room will ever come into contact with this software. come in touch, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is carried out or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the most experienced companies are wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that by analyzing data analysis breaks of flu, the worst kind, they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"" "it just didn't work, this was another sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" "" "Nature" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">In spite of all these errors, data increasingly streams into decisions of life -- at work, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First, dismantle this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the items; as a second, put the individual parts together to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: taking apart and putting together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again even if the information is incomplete, in order to get a good decision -- especially if it is the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence wherever they belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience, what they would otherwise have been unable to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like "House of Cards" from it did not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they entered a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first when they competed for TV ideas than they chose "Alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" "" "this is telling us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things are going wrong when data begin to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called Magic 8 Ball. it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it out later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, where I should have listened to the ball afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="1133">However, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with a little more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">In the end it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data it still pays off to make decisions, be an expert in what you are doing and take risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
