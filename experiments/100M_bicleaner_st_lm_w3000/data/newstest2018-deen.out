Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a mine chapel , where it is now being dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers cultivate the ru@@ sty ground of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days .
it is annoying if maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows that , because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a circum@@ fence .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but especially insi@@ ghtful .
especially when comparing them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet that one does not recognize as such .
more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ posi@@ tional sheets , were incorporated into the large picture postcard for towns and villages .
these were created according to the Bavarian Ver@@ Mess@@ ungs@@ verwaltung between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon was looking for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even though the French troops followed the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9th , 18@@ 01 , it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a covering Bavaria map .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Josef drove the project forward , set up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Palace of surve@@ ying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Copyright Journal for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all other documents on the Bavarian State Library &apos;s website .
the comparison of early / today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was in@@ scri@@ bed in the Munich District by 21 years after the map was created , 18@@ 77 .
today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling lies in the middle of the city .
the houses of Lower Saxony were concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the revol@@ t of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in appears a small @-@ part card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; original recording &quot; from which the land tax was derived .
&quot; &quot; &quot; small plots there are no more farmers there today - but farmers from the plant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Land in the sun &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , which has been the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street names &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; - but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once closed people with ma@@ dness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich @-@ based &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Circle Ir@@ ren@@ aissance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was created &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Venti@@ lation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden was head of the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , finished fixing the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the prison .
for 280 patients first place was first , and later was expanded to 500 places .
at some point this capacity did not suff@@ ice anymore - the reason for the construction of the gy@@ ro @-@ center in hair 1905 .
Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 .
young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West is the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ aissance , which had been destroyed during WW@@ II during bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remains to this day - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English Institute , small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line @-@ line takes place .
with the sli@@ der you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Group Anno@@ un@@ ces Travel War@@ ning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ mers has issued a warning for colourful people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to pay special attention when travelling through the State , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based incidents occur in the whole country and be noted here , &quot; it says in the group &apos;s opinion .
a recently passed Bill of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to acc@@ use discrimination , as well as the State Law Enfor@@ cement Agen@@ cies that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , led the group to release the warning , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .
the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist crimes against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he no longer had any gasoline while traveling through the state and was arrested by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without bl@@ aming a crime .
the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Office , showing that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state are 75 percent more likely to be employed as wh@@ ites .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be ready to bring in ch@@ ewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th place of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed immigration laws which obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people on immigration violations , which will contribute to the further ra@@ cial profile according to AC@@ L@@ U .
travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but l@@ ately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States .
the fence project is elementary
the Wei@@ gh@@ au@@ n Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members of parliament Peter Weiß and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac made a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U city association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met in the court yard of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into his company , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals , and houses holiday palaces in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows , says Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste comes exclusively Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V Chairman of Fis@@ her@@ men , he described the broad@@ way project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fundamental importance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t win on such steep faces .
the gr@@ ass@@ land area provides for a lot of work , much had to be mach@@ ined with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental farm and carried out this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers , even if he does not run a bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader @-@ support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers are often critici@@ zed for the promotion
in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants .
the reserve area is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be en@@ forced until at least 20@@ 23 .
the total cost of 71 500 euros was given by half by Leader , a quarter contributed by the Municip@@ ality of Fisch@@ bach .
the farmers thus remained twelve 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 km of soft fence .
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann .
K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac emphasized : &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ owners , it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art partnership ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg allows state funding of soft f@@ ences .
the aim is the openness of the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the presence of a conveyor set indicated by the L@@ PR .
in addition , the area to be en@@ forced will not be fli@@ pper@@ y ( slope above 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation .
the application of eight participants with 24 plots , which would build just under 16 kilometres of fence , is currently under construction for the Fis@@ her@@ men Wei@@ ob@@ ello Project 2018 .
the area of maintenance is equivalent to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 1,000 euros .
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Bag@@ h@@ dad &apos;s Square in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals for the dr@@ astic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .
to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue herself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty ag@@ it@@ ators would have g@@ yn@@ ted him if he had done it .
but it att@@ ested its importance , and in particular the importance attributed to it , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
as Miller A@@ co@@ sta insul@@ ted , &quot; I don &apos;t want to go down to a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem that you refer to later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is impro@@ per@@ ly correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history .
it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who lon@@ gs to breathe freely , the poor waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ erable tr@@ ash &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better to see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action .
the sculpture should show the links between French and American re@@ public@@ ans by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical picture .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem to the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conservative , bringing the American flame to the world &apos;s surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty moves forward .
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
rather unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something here .
the significance of the statue is quite and even a matter of point of view of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable but hop@@ eful people after long and often horri@@ ble journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .
and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
their torch will not illumin@@ ate the way , but ign@@ ite hatred that is their only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ bt Scottish members of the Great Britain team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Great Britain team
the High Field Arti@@ stic Director of the UK , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship team will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 , which ki@@ cks off on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Scotland has developed something special &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the UK &apos;s athle@@ tics need to learn something from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Black said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m route , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team as a team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the genuine feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought in quite naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les at her fifth World Championships , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Sc@@ ots are in the British team .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle @-@ range runner Mu@@ ir runs along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man to watch after a great season , which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary games .
Do@@ yle is reminded of her first World Championships , when the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell was .
the team captain says that they are &quot; immen@@ sely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als .
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates tuned for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the clothes that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only shows how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to Po@@ dium .
what concerns my speech as a captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block critics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat up of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the papers struck him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , sure .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that brings me to Mary@@ land Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union compl@@ ained to him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a back@@ lash with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Na , and ? &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only Facebook , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to draw his hair @-@ loose head to chemotherapy on his side .
that is why the blocking of persons who come to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum , officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moder@@ ation .
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to the Catholic faith of Ho@@ gans .
Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; I commented pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the comments section of the news program &quot; The Post . &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and are not recognized as a large group of citizens affected . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees referred to as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam assault , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ p@@ ses , or to arrest or arrest demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what is happening digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell last week in Virginia .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County injured the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
this should not be so difficult .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters fell on his lead .
and even then , Washington had an anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms such as &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; wrote letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions , which critic@@ ised his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Britain , over@@ came his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation .
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort at Renaissance Club
the former European No 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the ren@@ aissance club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an holds the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ th@@ re , who last year led by Arch@@ er@@ field left to En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he set up this place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the home @-@ based player in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on homeland .
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad how it went so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer by passive smoking
fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer over the past two decades .
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking annually , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Director Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in comparison , he drew his own study on this subject from 1994 .
at that time there have been more than 400 cancer tom@@ bs due to passive smoking per year in Germany .
the new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction work on the Vill@@ inger Street is in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie half@@ way in time &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the head of the station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , as there is much se@@ amounts in the underground , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which is constantly ham@@ pered by the construction work , is a major problem for the construction company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ignorance of drivers from red lights and barriers is enormous , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road is closed and only the buses are entitled to drive through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p company have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot; &quot; &quot;

poverty and Death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai rule in the un@@ tranquil Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour , the cu@@ ed tu@@ ber is extracted and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless space serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course , late to work can be dangerous : most of the village men are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying troops .
an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence from the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal monitors from it .
in 2003 the Province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , with the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea that included the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ il and then a morning 5 hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the town with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences and from corrugated iron roofs , which were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones due to rust .
only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and virtually no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans worshipped a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright rock . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold@@ mine in the world , gras@@ shop@@ per , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , lies just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has min@@ ed $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Pap@@ ua has valued wood resources valued at $ 78 billion .
these wealth , however , are a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua who ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military retains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
a 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ ua demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Pap@@ ua were killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
Mass@@ ent@@ kill@@ ings in Pap@@ ua &apos;s tribal lands in the 1970 &apos;s became genocide in accordance with the United Nations Human Rights Commission .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; is said in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims , since incidents happen every week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the screws have intensified , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is of 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes since Muslim economic migrants are coming from the most den@@ sely populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce .
local people fight to keep up here .
&quot; migrants have begun to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , who moved to the provincial capital of Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; it has ta@@ sted the native pap@@ ua - Mama @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; of Pap@@ ua - her market . &quot;
Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Pap@@ ua during his campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter captured 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Pap@@ ua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after the opening of the Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should shut off their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers offen@@ ded their tone , and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers , having drunk , hun@@ ted and beat the group with their guns , said the victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ sm Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into a coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children assembled on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting @-@ bows and introduced the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously and a bird song im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ ua &apos;s Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started throwing stones at police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali looked at the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I turned around , suddenly I was shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the bul@@ let came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans only bears a name , the TI@@ ME in a dark mood . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw that he was dead ... I knew him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , told repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came &apos; filtered &apos; only on the following day after Jak@@ arta .
three weeks in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate talk in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical de@@ mis@@ e in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security Minister Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will establish an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of the injuries have occurred a long time ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 &apos;s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we are committed to addressing these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to establish a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wi@@ ran@@ to , which the UN has accused of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; that caused more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Pap@@ ua were already included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ous cre@@ dul@@ ity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid of being shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in the neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a building firm ref@@ using to bring a un@@ conscious man into hospital , one person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on his way to the hospital .
excited village residents prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s sit@@ ing office .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( in@@ don@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will render ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the wounded have been delivered quickly , the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself in my house for two days . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called for an account of the officers involved and with@@ drawing the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a Te@@ hr@@ an for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by increasing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indonesian soldiers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily det@@ ained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is out of range .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ aries and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
over time , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native pap@@ ua and the new migrants , who have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the hub of Nab@@ il .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pap@@ ua have rarely capital or necessary skills to manage their own companies .
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Go@@ bai , Chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai .
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media coverage remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they gave them the rare permission to shoot .
according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s campaign to highlight the restrictions of coverage in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report about Indonesia &apos;s un@@ troubled provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ paper@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s immediate neighbours .
in March , six Pacific countries - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r rec@@ alled the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there are free media , making it difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai committees , &quot; says Go@@ bai , Chairman of the tribal council .
he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is in poor education and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai is saying that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the dead body of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station .
they know that they may never give justice to them , but at least they don &apos;t forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head .
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the world &apos;s highest towers in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story building .
it is the second fire , which in just two years is swe@@ eping through the high @-@ rise , which one calls accidentally the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) .
the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down@@ stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; told a resident who named his name George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units at 4.@@ 00 local time ( 00 : 00 GMT ) extingu@@ ished the fire and cooled down the building .
the government said that they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve issues relating to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage from facing , exterior pan@@ elling for decoration or insulation came .
in Britain the police said that the system of plates for insulation and facing on the London Gren@@ fell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire where about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup Reform : far@@ ther Best @-@ of @-@ five
the president of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) went through with his Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the Davis Cup single was a revolutionary proposal for this sport to play only on two races , but was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the five @-@ set classics , which are often very long , but also highly este@@ emed , remain the traditional competition .
6@@ 3.@@ 54 % of the member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was scar@@ c@@ ely missed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hag@@ ger@@ ty said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you will continue to work on improving the applications .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consist@@ encies , the proposal had already come to carry out the finale at a neutral place .
new from 2018 is only comparatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right in the next round in the following year .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training places etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items into the aircraft , find out a survey
a survey among air passengers revealed that more than 20 percent conscious or un@@ consciously prohibited items were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled by the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft , while accidentally worn knives or other items with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed they had bel@@ ated that they had mistakenly traveled with guns , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives .
the survey was conducted with more than 1,000 people - a Jet Charter Service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was carried out - it also stated that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules .
of the respon@@ dents who admitted that they have know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X .
the most common items ab@@ used by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent admitted , know@@ ingly worn items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane .
the company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently brought s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many would have deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry the safety , those who fly most frequently .
however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the T@@ SA are prohibited fluids .
for a while people thought T@@ SA could watch books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled ware .
liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k does not matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is happy to present with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
it has under@@ gone so far that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the ever trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k once again betra@@ yed another , less da@@ zz@@ ling figure in the announcement of the recent quar@@ terly assessment : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .
during the past few months , Mus@@ k has often adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k dre@@ amed : 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 reservations .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are non @-@ binding reservations .
in the event of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; reservation payment &quot; completely .
at present 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations acc@@ ru@@ e to Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could be addressed .
his argument : the challenge in ambitious growth targets is not on demand , but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 by 2020 , one million .
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are currently 1800 reservations per day .
who orders today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la creates his brand new production lines which have never been tested in practice without major interrup@@ tions with maximum capacity utilization .
many experts doubt that this is possible .
but if it comes to greater delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la .
because then the company cannot prevent cont@@ ented customers from running away in dro@@ ves .
EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt returns to reduce emissions because of the withdrawal of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules
one day after being su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , with@@ drew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama @-@ era rules to reduce the emissions of smoke @-@ causing air pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a deadline agreed on 1 October for States to comply with the standards set out in 2015 for o@@ zone @-@ related o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt told in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was due to President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s prosec@@ utor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legislative set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ it regulatory roll@@ back agenda . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , a Federal Appe@@ als Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , oil and gas company to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ ck proposed that his revers@@ al of o@@ zone standards simply reinfor@@ ces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with states by the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not followed the dead@@ lines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EP@@ O more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority we give to us seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the opinion of the EP@@ O stated that at some point , P@@ ru@@ itt will use its &quot; authority to delay and all other constitu@@ tionally available powers &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states who had lam@@ ented EPA this week , said the group intends to maintain legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil o@@ zone is created when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .
the resulting smo@@ g can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .
representatives of public health care and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered on P@@ ru@@ it &apos;s surprising change of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is trou@@ bling how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to engage in environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their particular interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius @-@ Kirche : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen is invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16th July at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gen their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the year 12@@ 67 : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church in Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; to the Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .
the wording of the document , in addition to the former parish church , was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age right belonged , and not the other way round .
there were also people there .
as it emerged from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , the &quot; Berg &quot; was the third , the glorious settlement centre of the village , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen .
old maps dating back to the year 1600 have under@@ gone these historical facts .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ ism arose from early medieval property law .
a gent@@ leman who built a church , and occupied it with a priest , remained the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed this church .
it was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the bigger ones of the two were torn to Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the new bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the window pan@@ es were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bell pieces were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
rem@@ n@@ ants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 , the Hil@@ arius C@@ emetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the listeners .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the bell tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Night in 18@@ 34 a storm spl@@ its the bell tower and half collap@@ sed .
in order to prevent mis@@ fortun@@ es , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em cher@@ ish the &quot; Schaff@@ hausen pen@@ sion@@ ers &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn the Hil@@ arius system .
as organis@@ ers , the friends and promot@@ ers invite Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle .
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler High School Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the town hall Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann refers to the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 p.m .
to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows up to the forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers expose the fantastic view .
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius complex , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and listeners .
the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin feel particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to allow approval of wind turbines
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim def@@ ends itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal pre@@ condition for construction and therefore has turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it may be illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all , because at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power zone exists .
in this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is fundamentally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city .
such zones should prevent &quot; as@@ par@@ agus cultivation &quot; of the landscape .
although a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided by a change in the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette - but the district government did not appro@@ ve Düsseldorf because of a mould inf@@ alli@@ ble .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning law , the granted approval letter is illegal and therefore also to be accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government is still pending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is ruled out according to planning law . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms receipt of the invitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the corresponding letters have been made in the circle Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; declared a speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them for the occasion to re @-@ examine the matter .
however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette .
already last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had le@@ ases contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .
the construction of the four wind turbines is expected to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - equivalent to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s municipal coun@@ cill@@ or gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies with a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ ab@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in death .
two more people were injured easily .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police data , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch and her passenger car travelled to the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person .
city and retailers plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ a@@ er and people from the region will re@@ discover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the trade association and the city administration want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract residents to the city centre .
as the president of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat @-@ Sh@@ oppen &quot; -@@ weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers for what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket @-@ goods .
accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city centre are meant to invite you to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the action aims not only on residents of the city and the closer region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed pur@@ ses that refer to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the trade association and the city go to another stage of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes new offers such as the first &quot; Active @-@ Day &quot; to the well @-@ fest with sal@@ ut@@ able Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the aband@@ on@@ ment of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be newly or again developed .
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many local people lost sight of the inner city while shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the inner city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs .
it was a good idea to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network that was partly broad@@ ened , in the spring of the year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gia cities , took part in the nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , these are Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heili@@ gen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the appreciation of local trade and increase its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that each citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .
two dead and several injured after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy .
according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a final in critical condition .
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed during the explosion .
one first missed was later also found dead .
the dead were employees of the school .
the authorities suspected work on a gas pipeline .
only a few people stayed at the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy &apos;s building during the holiday season .
pump deployed after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts of telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
on January 27 , Tr@@ ump called on a telephone call with Mexican President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to stop public saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US president challenged him because he had den@@ ounced the wall publicly . according to reports , he said to him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; dum@@ b &quot; and that the existence on the trade created by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees to the United States .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after Mr Turn@@ bull said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists re@@ unite rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ch act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury passed through a group of viewers in the Mon@@ roe countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men with ri@@ fl@@ es emerged to block its path .
the leader of the mo@@ obs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle stri@@ pe suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates were floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene played on July 22nd was just a reflection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; almost all of the audience che@@ ered very real si@@ ghs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been as@@ simil@@ ated by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organisation of post @-@ employment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ s@@ man in Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
for him , pos@@ ing serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that a wrong has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want criminal prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a medical exam@@ iner puts a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on 27 July 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files received by the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but no one was ever indic@@ ted .
although the susp@@ ects have been on free feet for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch events throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FB@@ I , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com seemed to have a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Dor@@ othy with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid 600 dollars to release Mal@@ com from prison , according to the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from the prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy involving government and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks puts it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , many of which believe that he no longer exists in America .
it is hard to watch , and yet harder to look , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because we are confronted with the ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve been through . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest of the Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director .
he has played the role of Chief C@@ lan@@ mit@@ ee for many years , but he said the role would never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , the actors Per@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines .
the piece begins with Mal@@ com who scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , n --- He , van@@ ish from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire is reci@@ proc@@ ated by Ras@@ cona .
there is a break .
and then everybody ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; Gre@@ ene said , still chu@@ ck@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think white people at that time &apos; n --- he &apos; said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the other black actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship provides for the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time when Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition stops violent and fast .
there are cri@@ es , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman clothed with a mour@@ n@@ ful dress stands above the cor@@ p@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays sorry song &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ ped silence and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .
a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as pressing hum@@ id nearly eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch mur@@ ders took place , the air feels sti@@ g@@ ly .
when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead body .
children sit in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ch rope and wipe their tears off .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in turn , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ cona embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you did it for a reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joined the actors for dinner together .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta talks about the delivery with a black pair that they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words , which feeling left behind the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these horri@@ ble words and deeds ... coming from people who look like yourself and who do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks holds courtyard at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the emphasis is inspiring in a way because it describes the fear of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like that if we don &apos;t learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; re@@ conc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ an in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a multi @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous st@@ aging in front of a giant , six @-@ storey cou@@ li@@ sse .
the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by A@@ lek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows optionally a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car parks in which the Rhine @-@ hop@@ pers pose as rock energies , or alternatively an is@@ etta .
&quot; &quot; &quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and gre@@ ed - which goes through his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ aging . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the three Rhine kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl und Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize beautifully as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
K@@ ES@@ S dec@@ ei@@ ves Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ style a cor@@ p@@ se breaks into the trunk and give the Kra@@ ken @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen Mill@@ ing sings the del@@ ici@@ ously nasty Hagen , who envel@@ ops the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight box .
brutal the scene , when he s@@ miles Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience thank@@ ed the ensemble with great applause .
Fo@@ ster , Mill@@ ing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski can be celebrated stor@@ m@@ ingly , who humble himself and bent his hands on the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te .
big applause exists for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure wear .
the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2013 he had to pass a bell of the Pfei@@ f@@ konzert out about himself , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation , in which the scattered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have rejo@@ iced in this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you realize that the audience has grown together with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the public has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it has also grown an understanding of its point of view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work at several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I spend here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with this ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide range that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer .
how does it come about ?
quantity : I have graduated from high school .
and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully stopped .
I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people .
and then I asked myself what are you doing .
do a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really is .
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system in the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably do a social worker education in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the university of applied sciences .
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it probably always depends where one makes his FS@@ J .
one can do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really works .
other than in Civil Engineering ?
quantity : well , here is not a question of calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family , must always go into it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is the same .
Pear@@ son shor@@ tens more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and trim their divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing .
job cuts , announced by the Director General John Fall@@ on , for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , are in addition to its previous restructuring , where already 4,000 points have been lost .
in May in a third cost @-@ cutting program , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month said that the outlook for the financial year was unchanged , after achieving an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
Kab@@ ul con@@ vo@@ y attack : NATO soldiers killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in Kab@@ ul Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and one interpreter were injured , shared an explanation of NATO .
according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
in an opinion of NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m .
according to the United Nations , there was at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had done this attack .
on May 31 , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack in the country , since the US @-@ led troops crushed the Tali@@ ban in 2001 .
the violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious level of security in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that in the past weeks the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA revers@@ es decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
the U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay regulating the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to cur@@ b smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this happened a day after 15 states compl@@ ained to the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; O@@ zone Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and said that it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country in order to specify where cuts must be made to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 most democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to drive back a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tr@@ ump , should boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of democr@@ ats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce the lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community wants common room
at the end , the decision was clear : with two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ est@@ rels decided to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed , mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden reports .
although it will still take a while before the church community has so far been part of the community , there is no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common space .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the council are afraid of not seeing such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the righteous living , but open to the community .
as an example , the word from &quot; Kn@@ itting Café &quot; made the round .
the decision which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current household was decided by funding opportunities already last autumn .
the building is located in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area .
the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ ades , capable of handling 60 percent of 30 percent .
the proposed proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw clubs between the legs , the finding that both the artic@@ ulated truck is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as the pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical .
need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer means , be this additive .
if it helps : he does the body unanim@@ ously .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniela Ruf points to the many of its own buildings , with which one should not be so right now , for that , one now backs up in the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am very difficult with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to investors who are already wealthy or even foreign investors .
that is not the case , because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but a real counter @-@ value which is in the doubt of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ iga &apos;s request to split the proposed resolutions is three advoc@@ ates .
it remains with two counter@@ parts in the original program , which sums up Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; if we take the decision this way , we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was captured in Gar@@ eth on Wednesday in Gar@@ eth and was seriously injured .
as the police shared , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling around 12.@@ 20 clock with his bike on the bike path of the road Black @-@ way from the direction of Hil@@ den .
the senior wanted to cross the road in the amount of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver , travelling in the same direction , takes preced@@ ence over him .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving onto the road , he obviously did not heed the traffic .
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ch carriage .
FC Bayern Munich must disp@@ ense with the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without it : David Al@@ aba must let the game go against Dortmund .
FC Bayern will be travelling to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season .
seven professionals lack the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 pm / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the staff of the German football record champion Bayern München is getting bigger and bigger at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to do without a Du@@ el with the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian was confirmed on Friday .
there are also Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at .
for the five defe@@ ats in the last six reviews , An@@ cel@@ otti has made the physical condition and the missing balance in his team &apos;s play .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance within the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not good at last . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official match of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
we want to play intelli@@ gently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) announced on Friday .
walking in the Harz from Star to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the Harz , the nation &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association is planned by the astronom@@ ical observ@@ atory Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met the information needs of many har@@ ms , it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he unites nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase to 2018 the association is planning &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; easy accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check out St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber .
the information on the tables should be supplemented by internet .
a good mobile network reception therefore plays a role in the selection of locations .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the Star@@ path train is to be extended by train .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the star path the viewers experience much worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they also learned why stars could have different colors or why a star is stronger than another , although it is far more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .
the association has been operating in the mountain town St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany since 2014 .
according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with the naked eye can be seen clearly .
since 2003 there is something similar to the planned star@@ light - the planet path in the university town of Göttingen .
starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel at the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf Planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun at exactly 75 meters distance measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire distance of the planet is about four kilometers .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
the march to the next fixed @-@ star , however , would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ divisions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday in Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you good luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko is defending his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko &apos;s manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remembered Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I went up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
the fans demand that .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boxing needs this fight &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to schedule a date with Gar@@ cia in the next summer ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their light weight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia and later openly expressed himself to fight at the network offering the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this type of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he enjoys Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko thank@@ ed Gar@@ cia with the generous praise and said that he thinks the three @-@ fight champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus is to show stro@@ kes , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the struggle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four injuries to T@@ ire plat@@ ter
during an accident on the A@@ 7 four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
at 4.@@ 30 p.m. , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle , presum@@ ably after a punc@@ ture of tyres , shortly before the end of the connection .
the car ri@@ gged to the right into the slope , where he was defeated and then lying on the roof in the green strip .
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was closed to the north for about an hour , then the traffic could be passed on the left road@@ side at the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ cycle works better &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig that the optimisation of the defensive formation will points to Au@@ e points . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy with the result even if not the two opponents were against Brun@@ swi@@ ck at 2 : 2 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we need to be better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the def@@ ences player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tri@@ cycle is to be further optimized in the Or@@ e Mountains .
and a gate after a free thrust , the For@@ tun@@ as don &apos;t want to catch any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future it will be that no one puts on the line alongside Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will better cope with the experience in preparation with the tri@@ cycle than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t yet know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have players in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann &apos;s half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gieß@@ el@@ mann , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ise even better and we cannot afford so many play@@ things in construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course Hoffmann goes to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about a failed start , you don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we can stand at four points on Sunday and concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about it .
&quot; I judge the start into the season only after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped pre@@ mat@@ urely because of an accident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland come as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away , just because we have the aspir@@ ation to come under the first six is non@@ sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ li@@ ga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as chief coach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; making such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application assessment tests published
the recent results of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( Rä@@ t@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) has begun testing the tests last year .
during the asylum process , they should take a closer look at the assessment of age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Migration verk@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 2017 .
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suggest that the examined person was 18 years or older . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results published , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had said openly that she would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critici@@ zed in some areas .
a skep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usual through pu@@ ber@@ ty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the kind of measurement should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we can &apos;t say it safely , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is minimal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg proceed well .
on Wednesday a seven tons concrete sla@@ b was installed at the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , construction manager at the Department of Civil Engineering and Transport in the Regier@@ ungsp@@ räsi@@ dium Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April the work began simultaneously on all three rehabil@@ itated bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the building is scheduled for October , and it is certain that the schedule will be adher@@ ed to .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is an arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come to the years .
in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated .
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach arrived on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons of heavy so called bridge cap .
this is a border fast@@ ener , which is also used as operating distance .
at the southern part of the bridge a bridge cap of 2.@@ 20 meters is to be used on Friday .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is supposed to run .
the special feature is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps .
particular delic@@ acy has required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ outs on the project .
fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building site and the con@@ glomer@@ ation in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the street in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed .
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 Euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
it does not happen so often that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise only difficult to reconci@@ le .
the parties represented in the county of Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Linke ) belong to a broad alliance , which on this day shows peac@@ efully flag , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud poster &quot; big election campaign . &quot;
and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top @-@ winning duo for the Par@@ liam@@ entary elections on September 24 , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
originally the city picnic under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; was planned on the fountain square , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ elle - and thus right in front of the eyes of those coming to the Af@@ D @-@ Event in the Stad@@ thalle .
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair@@ woman of the forum A world and one of the leading organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original potato salad , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pipes from the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel says he has tried to make such an event and get the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf lived in Dau@@ n at first , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kirchen no parking spaces were available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ elle , Hom@@ me is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the event at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it also does : at 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz square , in the Stad@@ thalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ president Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who wait for the top candidate for the election of the Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chair@@ woman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
the Af@@ D @-@ event lasts a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 9 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police can move away - no special incidents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf @-@ tro@@ mb@@ one Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ freiheit series tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German training with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo part of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to exceed the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new robe , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; World Music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz singer N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play mix to an intri@@ gu@@ ing total artwork .
this core of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously involved in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people like grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart has openly expressed her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the probably best @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was that of Robert P@@ att@@ inson , her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleague , who ultimately dealt with bitter@@ ness .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette performer is insured against the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously in love with whom I have posted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten said that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed it seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so I have never been confused or hin@@ dered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I only never liked being taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she especially suffered , according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but in the school@@ days , when she pre@@ tended to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now I look back and think of myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; girl , be proud of you ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to have to justify myself before the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced on Thursday evening a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflections ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic Gover@@ nor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a big announcement at the West Virginia R@@ ally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
according to For@@ bes , Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes notes that he has coal mines in five states , and has inherited coal from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
meanwhile , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee released an explanation in which it was said : &quot; the party change from Gover@@ nor Justice is yet another blow to a Democratic Party , which would rather hin@@ der us than work in order to make our country magnificent again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said the R@@ NC President Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation to the C@@ BS News .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot; &quot; &quot;
the world boss of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as a clear ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be included in the sport again .
Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country from sports was correct and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were taken away in competitions of gold and silver med@@ als . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress agreed to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has realized that it has experienced some fairly hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; about Russia accepting the criteria for his re @-@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors .
the leader of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for rein@@ statement .
drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
act of mour@@ ning for soldiers in Mali
at a funeral service in F@@ ritz@@ lar , North H@@ esse , around 1000 people of the two soldiers in the helicopter crash in Mali were thinking .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
the Minister of Defense , Ursul@@ a von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the un@@ resolved crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they described the two revers@@ ed drivers but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; benef@@ actors of their professional &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow to this highest offering that they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Northern H@@ esse had died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali &apos;s West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom St Peter .
at noon only the relatives in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , close friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were H@@ esse &apos;s Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the German Ar@@ med Forces Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
grape gro@@ wers settled ro@@ ses , the relatives stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins .
before the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defence of the Do@@ yen designated the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sh@@ attered . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built up the flight operation of the helicopter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained Tiger @-@ pilots of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ak@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment , to which the soldiers belonged , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the crew could not turn away the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of the Do@@ yen , did not show : the use is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country of which we are separated only by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they will be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave beside his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
this was announced by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple will be buried in Ros@@ kil@@ de &apos;s cathedral .
the sculp@@ tor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision , she said , further in the message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to reign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 , he retired , taking the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prinz@@ reg@@ ress &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik does not get the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself equal to his wife - neither after death , said L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
the native @-@ born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristoc@@ ratic family , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London 1965 .
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French embassy .
during his later wife the sympathy of the people was always flying , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the Dan@@ es during his almost 50 years of reign .
Hen@@ rik wrote in a auto@@ biography about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stum@@ ps instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants rapid re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
according to Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the parliament , he does not want to res@@ ign .
this was the case on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
prior to that , the surprise withdrawal of a Green Party in Lower Saxony by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight one @-@ votes majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the former Gre@@ ens MEP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with non @-@ nom@@ ination for election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained in Hanover on Friday .
CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants his faction to accept it .
thus , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony region , SPD and Green 68 seats .
until now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be regularly elected on 14 January next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; red @-@ green state government &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must now decide whether to continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l considers it essential that the Land@@ tag rapidly resol@@ ves its self @-@ dissolution .
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the State Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament withdraw@@ s confidence from the Prime Minister and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options must be judi@@ ci@@ ally cleaned , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ ci@@ ally tested . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tor@@ revi@@ del called T@@ sister &apos;s step &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the ren@@ eg@@ ade members to return their Land@@ tag mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that , with immediate effect , she has returned to her country &apos;s mandate , which she received through the green country list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the regional leaders Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group president Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;

SPD candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Sax@@ on Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Gre@@ ens members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote on Friday on Facebook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the country &apos;s day .
the exit T@@ west@@ ens costs Red @-@ Green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their past vanity and their fru@@ stration are their personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty trick and tries to make political capital out of it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dutch CD@@ U leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ur@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ rich@@ est in the CD@@ U .
the group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , designed the West to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the Parliament election in 2013 with personal career .
at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force in front of the SPD , SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in parliament .
agriculture ministers in an interview - How do we protect ourselves against gre@@ ed , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses the contaminated eggs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how could the sc@@ andal be ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture , Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) , talks with the editorial network Deutschland ( R@@ ND ) and answers .
Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from contaminated eggs ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can only encourage consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ food@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if , after all , what we know at present , a health hazard is practically excluded .
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the enligh@@ ten@@ er is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Economy ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has turned out immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany &apos;s const@@ ern@@ ation .
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
the trade has the same importance as the manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
if the residual water content of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not market@@ able .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time , the factories are not to blame .
are manufacturing firms and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
at the time of knowledge , the production companies do not make immediate blame .
rather , they have to expect economic damages due to the presum@@ ably illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there is too little control in the case of seri@@ ousness .
is there only a lack of staff or a tight back@@ war@@ dness ?
it was just the official controls that uncovered the process .
however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can exist are of decisive importance .
I have already made clear several times that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm mis@@ m necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly tra@@ ged .
through the fake means , manufacturers , distributors and consumers get into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ borne animals is not acceptable and must be terminated immediately .
this must be applied consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I expect from all competent authorities that the atomic fact is quickly and completely enligh@@ tened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how the finance rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Mo@@ ving to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imped@@ ed expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not dis@@ rupt N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial Fair Play rules , which were launched by UEF@@ A in 2011 , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to extract Brazi@@ li@@ ans out of their contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make money easy for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , in view of the funding of the team through the power @-@ rich master family of Qatar .
clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but they must counter@@ act legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break even point in their football @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin if banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tough@@ er issue .
during the current three year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , Clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ idency of 2015 , his successor A@@ lek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in will continue to be deter@@ red by excessive spending .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the proceeds for the next five years will be deduc@@ ted from 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of € 60 million ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ wi@@ t their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income by businesses associated with the owners of a club .
while a Q@@ ar@@ usi@@ an enterprise might sponsor the PS@@ G , if the value of sponsor@@ ship exceeds the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not allow it to be regarded as a legitimate income .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor had been infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that a portion of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s PS@@ G payments could come on payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar &apos;s 2022 are cont@@ ested that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a manoeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to any attempt to ignore the rules .
UEF@@ A had no preliminary discussions with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports reveal that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year still have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and jer@@ sey sales .
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s removal by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last owner at PS@@ G .
Ar@@ senal manager Ar@@ sene Kenn@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of the owners and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new source supplier
chocolate Fre@@ y board chocolate has been made for Swiss over the past few years .
now the sweet collaboration stands before a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the contract .
on the request of the news agency , Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report published by the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very happy with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the speaker .
around 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ ots of up to 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with &quot; North @-@ Western Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of some 1 billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a producer of sho@@ cks .
Swiss Life does not want to betra@@ y the number of applicants to the new tender .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y tries to renew the Treaty on Spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer could not be reached for comment .
Swiss Life has been distributing chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006 .
prior to signing a contract with Mig@@ ros , Barry Cal@@ le@@ baut had supplied the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with various Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights the customers of the First Class are spoiled with goo@@ dies of the Con@@ fis@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class passengers &apos; Comfort@@ gg@@ i by Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i also distri@@ butes on the short circuit of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gic geht in &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 &apos;s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( when the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter turned the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to greater things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd hum@@ our ( it contained an original story for a talking box of vegetables sung by H. Jon Benjamin ) .
switching to the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play hor@@ ny children who will grow - they still managed to reg@@ ain the im@@ possibility of reg@@ aining the last part of the weather .
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes beyond the watering system principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ he years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character sticks through an Apple Power@@ book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now a romantic author , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another ins@@ ane @-@ vi@@ cious plot involved in the Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , ex@@ ams are the best part of fran@@ chise .
it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s lip be@@ ard of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy is now feeling like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ma@@ dness that could heat this fran@@ chise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I consider his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War from &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ versus @-@ West R@@ w@@ ling I@@ con@@ ography .
the com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas , created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka , is to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ or and an ide@@ alist I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it &apos;s not much more than an idea .
there are some nice flags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on TV , as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game of &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or often enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who was edited to a lower length could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ or and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a for@@ age for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police managed to beat the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Office of Public Prosec@@ ution declared Con@@ stance on Friday .
fifteen accused were arrested between the ages of 25 and 77 and issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
officials also ensured greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros .
in the case of chron@@ ological ra@@ ids in Italy two persons were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
a total of more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed .
the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , heavy violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
since summer 2016 the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has established Con@@ stance against organised drug traffi@@ cking in southern Germany .
between the prosec@@ utor &apos;s office in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large @-@ scale operation was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the investigation focused mainly on Italian nation@@ als with closely related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
also a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account .
Weise prosec@@ utes large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has considerable short@@ com@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious wrong decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ e Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to major gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there could lead to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a way that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is present . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to information , ten million people with a foreign nationality are reported in the register , including about 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , data quality in parts has not been good so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 was found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who have long ceased to live , or citizens who have become German citizens and should actually no longer appear in the register . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slow down &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics of sufficient people , EU citizens are also captured , which would not have to leave at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such false classi@@ fications , however , led to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a distorted debate on dealing with migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it means in analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun to send back refugee families back to Italy with less than 16 years of age when they came from there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the paper , &quot; BA@@ MF , &quot; says this procedure , &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - has been going back to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper compl@@ ained about the difficult situation on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state that they reach first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , the state can return it to the country of immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on grounds of reason , the office is now writing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has substantially increased . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other EU states , too , would send refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin Agreement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ woman of the Left Opposition in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten human illegal admission conditions and a endanger@@ ment to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach has already provided the blood don@@ or service for other people .
at least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .
first of all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who , with his 100 donations , meanwhile shared 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , in the meeting of the municipal council , the congregation recognizes the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is brilliant how our body is laid out for it and we pay respect to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for foreigners , nor do it un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Manager of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , for the preserved foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents .
for example , three persons could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bach reported of the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Manager . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher number of participants a few years ago .
before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the multiple don@@ ors and received 50 donated blood donations for each of them .
half as many book Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ oth@@ ee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra locks , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter have given ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice .
Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation about an increase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it kept the interest rates on family income in the midst of a growing pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with less members striving for a rise in this month , as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase .
in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary revenue would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the fall .
but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years interest rate increases would be necessary to brid@@ le the inflation anticipated by Bre@@ x@@ it and it said that the bor@@ rowing costs would have to rise more than anticipated in the financial markets .
the members also voted to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economic package published one year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will take time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the coming February , although it is expected that it will now provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with £ 115 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , since pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extent than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Bank pointed out that increases would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; limited &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s forecast growth forecasts for this year and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to US $ 1.@@ 31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate rise and GDP growth in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank will recover slightly towards the end of the year .
the recent inflation forecast showed little enthusiasm for households , which will be affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening will first get worse before it becomes better .
she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot &quot; prevent income from getting &quot; , but added that wages are &quot; clearly &quot; rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated at the end of their three @-@ year forecast .
the economy is also boo@@ sted by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will offset some of the lower consumption expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the shock@@ ing EU vote that caused the fall of the boy@@ friend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until it will fully reach the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the reputation for interest rate rose increased as inflation increased the pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding a 0.5 % increase in July .
inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wholly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the weak Po@@ und . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Mont@@ br@@ ine , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent down@@ turn of the swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again as credi@@ tors are looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those who run the existing De@@ als and complete the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; trans@@ form@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight in front of the High Court against funding the drug in N@@ HS .
N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sexual pre@@ position prevention ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now being delivered from the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the trial after the Appe@@ als Court confirmed in the last year a judgment by the Supreme Court that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him .
the postpon@@ ed move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; crucial moment . &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be the first to enable the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV medicine taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious areas .
pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines can be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come into question for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy .
people who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medications this week following an international competitive procurement .
the study aims to assess the entire pre@@ p potential by collecting clinical evidence , how it is used and implemented in a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this major new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , when it is targeted to vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Board of Terror H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority now has to be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , shadow health minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how trans@@ form@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt gives us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people living with HIV , and that it will contribute to the emergence of HIV in society a step closer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Ear@@ ls Court Apartment into a spacious home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ig@@ ned from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 .
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was looking for something comparable to my prize . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the spaces in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement made it possible for Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .
at both ends a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all pots and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
collap@@ sible kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very important , so it &apos;s very easy to slide the door when pushing the door . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the ground size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that touch you and are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square footage of somewhat standard into something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave this .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperi@@ al@@ isms of Victoria in the value of over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and business assets .
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars , accumulated since the family purchased a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood in 1973 .
there the family founded West@@ co je@@ ans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to &apos;s development areas , the Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler apartments as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; is described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in has a value of $ 316 million and Paul has a value of $ 176 million .
the breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I kept for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now fight for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but acc@@ uses Paul to manage some possessions in@@ competent .
in an early ape @-@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both sides held law firms .
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delic@@ at@@ ess@@ ens from the late 1950 &apos;s and bought a business in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood Property , where Col@@ in opened the first je@@ ans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to boun@@ ce her property kindly to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark has paid $ 10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in held back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the television stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the case is in front of the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s very sad that my brother Paul decided to dress me up and draw our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our business will be resolved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can do it .
if so , he will be the first .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here &apos;s a piece by repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem to President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the president &apos;s hands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
wa@@ iter &apos;s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by over@@ seeing his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advis@@ er Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keeping Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter custom is under control , according to six former election campaign officers to ensure that personal media consumption has a constant praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay . okay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter custom ever &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maybe these campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know for others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have contained even more combus@@ tible material without their interventions .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump hasn &apos;t sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times , their efforts paid off .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent dump controversy .
part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to present their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump Material that possibly promotes their views of the world .
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers to provide question@@ able information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that pumping like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can get out of where they come from . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously issued a copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson has been permanently ban@@ ished from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false alleg@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump read the article and started asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gold@@ macher also added that the then Chief of Staff , Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us , and the General Secretary of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that the Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still striving for influence .
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
since the address is unknown , the help of the people is asked and hoped for .
in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminals are sent to the police all over Europe .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after criminals are naturally not known , references from the population are hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action followed by the winter on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Advent calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences have shown that many fle@@ eting hide from holiday destinations , it was said by Euro@@ pol .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have put together 21 post@@ cards for wanted criminals from 21 EU countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ ain@@ en has been viewed for more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them due to indications of the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return back to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the war feet , who have tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn by the church to rec@@ laim a field in front of their houses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous road called Soli@@ h@@ ull , called the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; million@@ aire series &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out in May without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their attacks .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defence systems and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry residents pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced by shame to implement it as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more came yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council can &apos;t even stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an inhabit@@ ant who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them moving as soon as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we submit our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Birken@@ hof will be Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof will be the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently under renovation and is to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Birken@@ hof through the then Ambiente business company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax .
in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ cont@@ ested at that time in the municipal council .
but above all , Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald has defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at that time .
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ das with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof during a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ zab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
you are greeted Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the earlier Hotel Birken@@ hof , building sh@@ utt@@ les have been in front of the entrance for quite some time , and when entering the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are carried out .
the floors have been pulled out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs are removed from the rooms .
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is a lot to do until March .
&quot; it &apos;s actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper .
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should later become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty petty @-@ bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses himself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment .
one does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a up@@ scale downtown level , Sch@@ erer says .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide , Sch@@ erer continues to explain .
individual holi@@ day@@ makers , groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel .
talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , he has already led , so sh@@ ear@@ ers .
the ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly the amount of investments desired .
just under one million euros , he calcul@@ ates .
the external systems are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible .
a large terrace is created in a courtyard , which is open to the public from the restaurant , which is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia Aff@@ air : us Special Issu@@ er sets up Grand Jury
in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent weeks , the committee accepted the work , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; referring to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified his investigation .
the station CN@@ N reported that there are already preliminary charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to have been specifically bl@@ amed into the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller investig@@ ates whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation will focus on several men acting as advis@@ ers to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign .
according to reports Mu@@ eller took a close look at more and more tr@@ um@@ ps for private and business environments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Issu@@ er Tr@@ ump has moved personally to the center and accused the accused of having imped@@ ed the President in the course of the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand jur@@ ys are therefore also called ank@@ le bun@@ tings .
most of the time they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases .
the process always takes place behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to invite persons to the company under oath .
according to the station CN@@ N , invitations were already issued which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
those who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report .
they should also provide documents .
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. was also Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner and his former election campaign chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort in the conversation .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that enforcement shows that Mu@@ eller should not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .
but it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .
however , the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Tr@@ ump .
in the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic gives the democr@@ ats a way to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury .
but this also usually works secretly , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any action that acceler@@ ates the work of the special finder in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; way &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief James Com@@ ey said three times that it was not determined against the President .
there is no reason to assume that something has changed from it , it was stated in the statement .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this dis@@ miss@@ al , accus@@ ations against dump have become loud , he refused to obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him for a set of investigations against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
according to the representation of US media , the White House gathered material against the special promot@@ er and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to divor@@ ce .
unlike an independent specialist of the Congress , such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired on the insist@@ ence of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
however , several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the promot@@ er could no longer be dismissed so easily .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the west @-@ Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the Kol@@ oss , which weighs over one tri@@ l@@ lion tons and weighs 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it has mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant gi@@ ants who have registered in the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
it is unclear to what extent climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the ic@@ e@@ berg .
in total , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s in the region for some 30 years , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the now abor@@ ted col@@ os@@ sus has so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swi@@ ms on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it therefore continues to grow in the sea and periodic@@ ally breaks off .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this archipelago was the balance between wa@@ xing and breaking down a few years ago .
a complete Shel@@ f is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen .
there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never gone so far as currently .
in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can be broken if a piece fails at a key point .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after melting .
however , the loss of sweat causes glaci@@ ers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest shelf of Antar@@ c@@ tica with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most popular withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among scientists is argu@@ ing whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly fall together , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
even though these researchers are not returning this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , many of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula &apos;s mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ances have fallen apart in recent decades .
this long tail of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research programme , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula was war@@ med up by about three degrees in the last 50 years and thus became one of the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f to staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ ant jobs , the CD@@ U asks us to step out of the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive .
only shortly before the summer break , the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous day 41 new positions in the administration have penet@@ rated .
more than 1,@@ 100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 tra@@ inees have finished their first working day .
the apprentices@@ hips in the circle are obviously very much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were recorded for the places to be awar@@ ding this year .
however , the circle is still lacking in staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
currently , there are 50 vac@@ an@@ cies in the M@@ ett@@ mann district .
among other things , the search for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration .
the CD@@ U now wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the administration shall work out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel development and personnel development &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wish of the parties . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to meet short @-@ term demand for skilled workers but to counter@@ act the future oriented application shortage , is called it .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , show concrete measures for lateral entran@@ ts and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before .
other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age due to age .
thus the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party .
he already provided a la@@ zy surprise on the day of his circle when he questioned the personnel costs and amazed the other parties .
people want all possibilities to be checked which allow an exit from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should aim at a ho@@ ur@@ ly rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service .
the sal@@ aries are now exactly prescribed , increases or more money only exists if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .
but the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act .
not least because of the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone of NGO Mig@@ rants Res@@ cue Tools
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had conf@@ is@@ cated a boat from the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ ention &apos; because their team had effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to comment on detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , saving human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only assess any accus@@ ations currently being collected after collecting all the information and judging the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Italian authorities had watched the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ ention &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October .
it is assumed that its crew is carrying din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are delivered directly to them by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can depart so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of over@@ throwing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must primarily have an Italian police officer on board who over@@ sees their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; essential changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel prize winner organisation is Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in the meantime , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens over economic development initiatives this month , and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who left these countries in hope to reach Europe .
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; &quot; &quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ enheim in the North Rhin@@ eland to enjoy the Tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs for four days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and Wine Festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
there were look@@ out points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , rewar@@ ding for the long tri@@ als .
on the second day they went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; again , View@@ point was located at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; flo@@ wer@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refresh@@ ments brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed sal@@ ut@@ al br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ li@@ ga gears up for e @-@ sports
do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of being swe@@ at@@ y over the stadium racing during wind and weather ?
fact is : e @-@ sport has long been a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high g@@ ages included .
the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ eine , who are increasingly involved in this area , have also recognized this .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed by FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that several clubs are rising on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup , &quot; where gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sports .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football must , in particular , deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian ones .
with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract you could be more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Bundes@@ lig@@ am@@ ann@@ schaft in Asia .
what is it all about ?
in the E @-@ Sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the FIFA World Cup match FIFA at competitive level .
as in normal sports , li@@ lies have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .
and in the 2022 season E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program .
but is it all about a right kind of sport ?
for many , the idea is certainly getting used to .
even In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ben had a long time dealing with the question .
for the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sport - such as increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive abilities , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction capacity .
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
checks are difficult for online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing .
the scientists emphas@@ ise the high integr@@ ative effect of the E @-@ Sports .
players are on the road internationally , which is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth for e @-@ sports .
in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and large tournaments .
sales tot@@ alled 130 million in three years .
that is little against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already international .
large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the U.S. Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ vendors Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is also a lot to do in Europe .
in a Norwegian school E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a subject , says F@@ rob@@ ben .
according to D@@ utt , football clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany is lag@@ ging behind in the European comparison , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann , V@@ f@@ B management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just falling into nostal@@ gia and clearing the old times is not enough today .
it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company to the modern market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ sed world , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also means de@@ bris . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t keep in mind that only football will remain as it was always . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter condem@@ ns because of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy pushing for suicide
a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls for suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condem@@ nation behind bars and five years were exposed to par@@ ole .
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for a negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free up to appeal .
she had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter was standing with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and facing down@@ wards , when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; her actions have led Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she finished his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she showed no repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that they are completely regre@@ t@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find that their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; age or maturity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or even their mental disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a public prosec@@ utor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I do not smo@@ ther the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I handle everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain that we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roy &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never participate in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a a@@ unt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no longer have this single person with whom I have been together since I was born , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call for another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , leap from a building , climb yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family .
in the moments before his suicide it wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz told that Car@@ ter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British fellow @-@ mate in Italy , belonged to her before being acqu@@ itted two years ago .
Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua Kim@@ mich was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .
FC Bayern takes a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm there .
something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ myself right away , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made the tie at his arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Con@@ fed Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavaria master . &quot; &quot; &quot;
good , the entry could have run better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples .
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign from the coach .
not the eight year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f consisting of youth players , de@@ but@@ ors and especially from the vac@@ ations .
sugar is distributed to those that you want to eat a lot , which you want to keep in a good mood .
so those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ mich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old flew over the field as a mini @-@ l@@ ame .
to the right rear , this is his position , the white bonds on the arm did the rest .
and in general , Kim@@ mich made me feel like the one who is able to put the ru@@ dder in his hand .
he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ coordinated tro@@ upe .
he had a look for the whole while many others were busy himself .
Vi@@ dal tries to re@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on the Devil &apos;s way to get out of the performances of the Asia trip ( also only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ k@@ ot not to fall negative .
after all , it worked out very well .
Sü@@ le was running next to Kim@@ mich , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , and they both worked confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times in the game @-@ building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not as we hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance when he made his debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game shift , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also taken for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as usual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the new entran@@ ts , one saw in the connection to the game .
for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , instead of six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ .@@ ch said good@@ bye after a few clicks in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting phrase : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Bavaria you simply have to win every game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he does not have to teach the new .

companies satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy lo@@ bt Contro@@ ll@@ ers tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region talk about a change in economic policy on T V @-@ demand - and at the same time the old Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the desires of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the biggest turning point sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the priority list of the country .
the Ministry is still hoping for a planning process this year , until 2021 the building law is to stand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the West circum@@ ference of Trier , which stands in the urgent need of the Federal Rail@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , says Ministry spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
Nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies .
the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce ) ( I@@ HK ) stri@@ ves , as suggested by Wis@@ ser , to wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine expor@@ ters sin@@ king for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to start their own company , praise the Chamber of Commerce .
the Chamber of Crafts Trier sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1000 Euro is provided for the passing master &apos;s exam and 2500 Euro if graduates start to work independently within ten years after the master &apos;s training .
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
the planned road construction is quick to create facts , while at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , Chief Executive Officer of the Trier Chamber of Commerce .
up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers , who want to hire science in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce ur@@ ges more orders to be awarded to external offices .
s &amp; D vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf also points out calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 .
Frank Nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a concept of the country as it wants to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
furthermore , the previous broad@@ band extension in the country is so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supplies in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with grade 3.8 .
they compl@@ ained about queu@@ ing internet connections and disrup@@ tions .
in contrast , ex @-@ Minister for Economic Affairs , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where she already cleared the field after four months of in@@ consist@@ encies .
Audi should change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a back@@ lash
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in over 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
the BMW president said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and was referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to forbi@@ d or restrict diesel vehicles .
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as re@@ vocation .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and may cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alization of exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ou@@ ting the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested , but driving back under normal driving conditions .
in the United States , several Volkswagen were indic@@ ted , others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be tried in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded .
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportion@@ ately to Volkswagen profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at Is@@ ar
the town wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
so that even the Is@@ ar visitors take part , a raft trip through Munich takes place on Saturday that has a special message .
if it goes to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and that &apos;s not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the Bau@@ refer@@ at wants to clarify .
on the raft you can see a large info @-@ saver .
it shows a tr@@ ash berg .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to an publicity campaign to appeal to Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is meant to shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protected wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
Mor@@ di@@ llo was , at times , one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ on dra@@ fts@@ men , the no@@ bles of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still working on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; For there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first few years as an artist , he proposed , among other things , as an artist for greeting cards - which fru@@ strates him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo had many fans .
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figur@@ ines cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his personal data , he still sits on the table today , works nearly ten hours a day .
on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , T @-@ shirts , stu@@ ffed animals and watches , his cute figures continue to spread worldwide .
for six years he has been working on a carto@@ on film and a TV series with his figures .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the main person in the film &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los favorite animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ th companion as a counter @-@ player . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is scheduled to come onto the screen in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is wor@@ dless .
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and the insect @-@ transmitting insects , what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions are causing great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute C@@ RI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the fall .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small ci@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened .
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include better distribution of water and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to d@@ rought .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ scores the growing threat in Mexico
the members of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce weekly meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .
they have been told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home .
security experts wrote three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings are enough .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no break from violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to has res@@ ig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter are their editors and their inspiration from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Val@@ dez , showing his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , trauma , night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a special public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was established in 2010 , in order to process the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to court .
at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although they are in@@ con@@ sol@@ ent and even though the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ er@@ ous .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we &apos;re suspi@@ cious of everyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , presum@@ ably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly freely in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically nothing to silence on the topic of Val@@ dez .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and ex@@ tradition to the United States in January Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields in the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of stu@@ d@@ ded , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living .
&quot; &quot; &quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; peace &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
first of all there was the publication of an interview with Damas@@ co Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anger@@ ed the sons , presum@@ ed aisle runners bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second fault was not to force Val@@ dez following the sei@@ z@@ ure of another newspaper , which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues had accepted that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars hol@@ dings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the dow@@ ry @-@ dow@@ ry problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce was founded , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
in the same year Val@@ dez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the persecution of Mexican drug history , wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ p@@ vi@@ ento TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that is attributed to you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who could cur@@ b like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they ask : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was his love of routine his ruin ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can best do their job and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home run@@ ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
the anger is , the editor of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing is going on with J@@ avier . &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .
the landscape changes constantly .
in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , no cell phones suddenly were allowed . days before it was known that sp@@ y@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ range quarter of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers who were not trust@@ worthy .
it is months since the repor@@ ters went to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has focused on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of the former famous Box@@ ers Juli@@ o C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to government spending , concentr@@ ating on the home town of the governor .
and there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Office , a kidn@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the reig@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which reigned almost all the political planes throughout the century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez were considered to be the best informed source of the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier we had known what happened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of his slender body . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez took a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .
journalists have become lou@@ der across the country by writing &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walking paths and buildings in organized protests .
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the Val@@ dez case .
at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and om@@ it them because they told the truth .
she has been asked since then to be re@@ group@@ ed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
Val@@ dez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a indiffer@@ ent society .
in his last book , &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who put under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; media group assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists from the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones placed next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to conclude , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to do as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publi@@ ci@@ zed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben E@@ spin@@ osa who together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City was murdered three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue their work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , indicates that drug traffi@@ cking makes him frigh@@ tened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became a repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all their phones began to bu@@ zz .
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with riv@@ ets and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the board , they released the news on the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce website via mobile phone .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
Sir@@ enen he@@ ul@@ ten nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez over@@ looked the polic@@ emen who held guards to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid , they did not show it .
under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce &apos;s employees followed his foot@@ steps .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the same day where J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send them to the road for reporting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used clo@@ aking to do@@ dge his enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening one .
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ hin@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain employee were so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so well received that they could even notice that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said she had had something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best @-@ beha@@ ved din@@ osau@@ r , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; its unbeliev@@ ably well preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; truly remarkable &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , ge@@ p@@ anz@@ ated her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he p@@ itted on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he hit something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .
the fossil , discovered by him , was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years in covering the wild animal within the 2,500 l@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy Earth @-@ cl@@ ump .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; if you b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is visible .
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although covered with arm@@ or and resembles a moving tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as a counter @-@ sh@@ ading that is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed itself to better mix in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ading , a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals .
it points to the fact that the din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure by eating meat @-@ eating din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution fav@@ ored the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the sh@@ ad@@ owing - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or sh@@ ing@@ ling animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this dos@@ sier was exposed to a real fight for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behavior on a massive , strongly cor@@ ded din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been in the chal@@ k period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to examine the animal for clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ els , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea .
at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South @-@ Flo@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably far@@ ther far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ served skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; Brown said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just ch@@ ew a little with your eyes , you could almost believe he &apos;s going to sleep . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge ther@@ op@@ ods , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , standing on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years to Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his frigh@@ tening ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster .
scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the ocean and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he p@@ itted on 21 March 2011 at the S@@ unc@@ or Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips hanging from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the p@@ anz@@ ated her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater equipment of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the bon@@ net still cover b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r .
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lot@@ tery .
the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it will .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rests of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates bearing the skull of the animal .
his right foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .
I can count the scales on his sole . &apos;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ rest@@ ation .
there are numerous wounded , kilomet@@ re @-@ long st@@ aus and g@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on the late th@@ urs@@ day afternoon .
according to the police , at 5 p.m. , between the connections between Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( Land@@ kreis A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , almost 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other during a thunder@@ storm .
there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons .
a police spokes@@ man said it was light to moderate injuries .
a large range of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident .
the A@@ 8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of Munich , a ten @-@ kilomet@@ re back @-@ up was formed .
as an A@@ Z repor@@ ter reports , it was also on the counter @-@ track to massive disabilities - by numerous g@@ aff@@ ers .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the vehicle bodies , which now have to be reck@@ oned with with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting on the train and sleeping .
or one is immersed in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ ered .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an uncomfortable or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the trouble @-@ free ticket inspection .
you simply confirm by your mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
a test operation is currently running on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the offer arrives , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will likely be available at many other long distances in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Bahn spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is the name of the train card de@@ valuation without a conductor .
in order to be able to use this , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do .
you also have to buy it via the app of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway .
and finally you need a seat reservation .
because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : you get into the train , call his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot;
the test customer then appears as a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
when the train atten@@ dant arrives at PLA@@ Y Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket .
so you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep quiet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should take advantage of the passengers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to travel without ticket control by our train atten@@ dant staff , simply check in the DB navig@@ ator yourself . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this allows passengers to make their journey more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ andel &apos;s Marketing Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are one of the biggest off@@ ences .
because often , however , one of the travelling companions does not have all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to present .
the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and this also applies only to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
other train numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
only one day after she arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled upon a post from someone from the High School .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , as no one else posted the information on her feed , she joined Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being saved on her tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was there , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed live by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of a brow@@ n@@ less body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought .
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she put her mobile phone back in order to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field Drive in the evening .
there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be Brown &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his ri@@ f@@ le and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am going to kill you ... animals all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we are used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and wept . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and power of resistance which consists of the point of view of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers .
when Fer@@ rel@@ l came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who carried a flower @-@ dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; on the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I couldn &apos;t take her away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a high point of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we need to do to liber@@ ate ourselves .
even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different than the next black women child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of Offic@@ ers Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter were connected with a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed totally after 9 August , &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities .
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s all here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her mate Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a question came to Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of ? &quot;
this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an already worked with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates .
his engagement led Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives , the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; went after Brow@@ ns shooting in the years .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because I will be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the Movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ &apos;s life , as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the nation@@ alization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the death of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 marked the film &quot; Black@@ Li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts .
black , gay women must carry the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ vely type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film based on its identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these junc@@ tions as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel your energy through the screen . &quot;
in the meantime the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have disappeared long ago , but the ra@@ cial links between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels bound to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers talk about bit gallery
the bit gallery moves people , although it has not yet been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping m@@ all at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting the population into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
the issue is hardly cold .
also on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg , &quot; the topic is discussed .
while the one @-@ bit gallery says : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be great &quot; ( Nicole Sc@@ ots ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a human &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) .
while pro@@ pon@@ ents build on a gallery to attract more customers into the city , the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian area is bleeding .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property in which the farmers market hall stands where 13 direct marketing products offer their products .
this will conclude with the beginning of the construction work .
the gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been buying in the farmers market almost every week for many years .
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cake of the land women always very happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing will settle in a market hall in the gallery depends on the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what are the best shopping facilities in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets , I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there are enough of them in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is well @-@ priced at the top .
as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable to a retail@@ er .
too bad , specialty shops almost no longer exist and what remains of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall does not fit together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmers market hall pass during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the gh@@ ost bit gallery already manage to drive all the business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and there is no need for a shopping center that is empty .
in my view it would have been better to promote a real peasant market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmers market hall , thanks to the ma@@ dness of many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when the farmers market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portrait with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , almost im@@ percep@@ tible - hanging from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being secretly graduated from the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( An appropriate simil@@ arity ) .
she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and ground@@ breaking dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has created through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA , which was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look a sharp , although somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since she pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the E@@ spi@@ on@@ age Act , computer fraud and theft .
her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing sits visi@@ bly on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the big success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum , extrac@@ ting the DNA from the tr@@ ash to produce a picture of how these people could look .
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in jail , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition .
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted the Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned M@@ use have become un@@ equal Bri@@ eff@@ ors who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; which fores@@ aw a future where the President of Chel@@ eme would transform and she would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as would be a welcome sort of happy coinci@@ dence .
there is also something deeper and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tr@@ ump takes a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against Trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to get rid of the rigid circuits he should fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the gallery , Mann@@ ing called for her over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , based on gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is her mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an all @-@ rounder of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in the biological sense , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with them is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned com@@ ic nov@@ ella .
it shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a free @-@ spre@@ ader in her hand from the United States &apos;s disciplinary powers such as King Kong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when they turn your speech , they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop your mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeting from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the com@@ ic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , which are gathered like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also focused on how everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University for killing
a nation @-@ wide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of Oxford University , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious Chicago apartment with fatal injuries .
on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ ws ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the District Court of Cook County demonstrate .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the cor@@ p@@ se was discovered on July 27 .
officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead on the scene , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , &quot; officials said .
she has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that they have now been assessed and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal case that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the University and Somer@@ ville College said in an email statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the UK police and are ready to help U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way imagin@@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shock@@ ed and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said that he insist@@ ed on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , which said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cru@@ el@@ ly .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ ws and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Grand Plaza management team published an explanation for the residents : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - the Russian Vice Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot; &quot; &quot;
Russian Vice Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the Organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and the WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are conducting the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has caused an error . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
mut@@ ations agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , the leader of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission .
in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no one is afraid to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was exp@@ elled from the WA@@ DA in November 2015 in the wake of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organisation in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again .
Al@@ di no longer sells eggs for the time being

from now on , only eggs can be supplied to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lice put@@ ty .
Al@@ di plans to provide clarity and transparency to its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the surveys did not work .
answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful .
and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there has never been consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Association Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
she called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer specialist groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint @-@ hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees &apos; commitment .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and poll@@ s from certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re @-@ drill why .
companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken have been pen@@ alised .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
the global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the latest Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments website .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the amber stand in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
scent has almost 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
a client recently signed up as a client .
as G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and if the chief executive board is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the court of public opinion has gr@@ asp@@ ed regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent .
if a company is found that does not treat its employees badly or behave ru@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and law@@ suits , &quot; said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously .
it was often a timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees .
now that the company is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by managers living in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair inter@@ ns - can be identified quicker and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience of employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer their software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
in February Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and raised its entire funding to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising given the inter@@ connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing research complex that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only applications .
the employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when people are happy to be in a company that &apos;s worth their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In who used both the Con@@ ver@@ Flyer and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot; &quot; &quot;
investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies are working well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it can have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can raise fru@@ stration and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; if you ask for more than 4,000 ideas , you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you don &apos;t follow , employees will ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if you don &apos;t care , why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , capable of re@@ organizing several teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the problems .
with Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better attachment of employees in a branch that is known for high sales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers .
and if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Brotherhood
it is about 23 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA football players talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their trim elements and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled in the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 p.m .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it has actually length@@ ened their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ C@@ LA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the already packed schedule of the players .
the compromise off the two days is more than a day at which the Brotherhood postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood have carried out practical exercises .
20 years before the start of formal preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A even if they add another point to the multiple routes of the players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they just pushed it through , they went on plac@@ e@@ ously , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it &apos;s really great . &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which is not an easy task in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and adjacent Lus@@ tica Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that was already ki@@ cked out with pe@@ eling posts .
brother players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room and then set up to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal .
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that &apos;s why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts sc@@ rut@@ iny in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to fac@@ tual verification by third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin using updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false reports and to send them to fact test@@ ers who may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections 2016 .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan that social media networks should be punished if they fail to quickly eliminate hate @-@ filled posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday Facebook commented in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts test will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to finding out what stories of fact test@@ ers are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they are reading and sharing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; connected item &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and working on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 &apos;s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has lived 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Main@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ olitan Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I find it so beautiful to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says with pride . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ A Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Rag@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional .
&quot; I just re@@ acted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says .
&quot; this is his thumb print !
and letters always smell smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were also there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ dge &quot; ) all this seems too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with coun@@ ties , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just started to look after the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats &quot; said , &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; you might think that country conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rho@@ des , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch that fought two families .
guys , let &apos;s go all the way ! &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; there is a recording of a tur@@ mo@@ il that oc@@ cured in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rho@@ des .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the uprising started in this area and I thought it was a good start . &quot; &quot; &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like The Pri@@ est , which tells the history of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ernity that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l was portra@@ yed in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the gent@@ lemen appeared to be Ga@@ un@@ er , always making loans and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford .
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crisis by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to promote land@@ lady . &quot;
Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of his deployment in the castle
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ mä@@ ki , the area of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 301 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf the town of Bad Honne@@ f has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz wish to keep the logo and slogan secret .
at the end of August , as the highlight of the campaign , there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rh@@ ön@@ dorf Chapel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to gain your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically , we are convinced that as a bad Honne@@ f citizens we are well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they compete with other communities .
a medium @-@ figure five @-@ figure sum can be used to cost the city Bad Honne@@ f its new umbrella brand and campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advis@@ es on boarding and carriage in the officer cor@@ ps .
this week also .
at first glance a normal procedure .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as before , but in the pres@@ idency of the Prime Minister .
under the chair@@ manship of the Prime Minister , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence , In@@ ner , Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the deliber@@ ations .
thus the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number .
the government re@@ ins the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the officers of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as a wi@@ re@@ head of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who allegedly participated in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week .
already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had described the coup attempt as a &quot; gift of God , &quot; as he gave him the opportunity to &quot; completely clean up the armed forces . &quot;
but has Erdo@@ gan really grip on the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in the military headquarters . &quot;
there are concerns in the general staff for an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ case ban for female soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
the great deal with the army and the security forces goes on .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan was sent by decree to fire another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state servants , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan was t@@ aming the military .
the gener@@ als used to be old masters of the country earlier .
three times they appe@@ aled to their role as guar@@ dians of the world@@ ly state order .
following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ ron@@ ged the power of the military step by step , not least with reference to the European Union &apos;s reform plans .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan drives a targeted Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a specially @-@ named officer , who sought asylum from persecution in foreign countries after the coup attempt , would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this is true , such a development could not leave NATO indiffer@@ ent .
any@@ how , in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington Rel@@ eases the Green Card Rules
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
it intends to reduce the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by changing the way US will output Green Cards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate circuit for racing platform shuttle
over and over again over the past few months , the future of the downhill race has been cont@@ ested - now it is going to be quite fast .
even before the end of the year , the route on which the tourist train runs is supposed to be built .
according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is to start on the track in order to secure the future of the event in the long term .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country acknowled@@ ges this particularly important connection for tourism , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Transport , Klaus stitu@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he paid the costs for the repair of the route to about 2.5 million euros .
of this sum , the country receives 75 percent .
the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered from the country on the basis of which the shuttle is to be ordered , is currently being fin@@ alised , declared the at@@ oning .
the Ministry and the South Thur@@ in@@ gia train as operators are already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the at@@ oning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this means that the ste@@ eper @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a rail link , especially popular among tourists , between the railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
over the past few months , during a pilot operation , it has been tested to see whether the track is used by sufficient number of people to re @-@ order them again in the future .
the route is also in parts strongly b@@ ump@@ y .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
just as you thought it can &apos;t get cra@@ zier in 2017 , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming .
yes , indeed .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin taking her ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail .
&quot; people are making fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often , &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
the user can &quot; adjust &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who would make a Step@@ et woman look progressive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion , featuring pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
during the day she also has her mo@@ ods - just like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ servi@@ ent female properties , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes one step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluc@@ tant ) Far@@ rah , trouble one the most .
on his website compared True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it means on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy .
their emergence and increasing fin@@ esse point to something dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional en@@ core .
most men , of course , don &apos;t have sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their increasing popularity , they remain at the edge of consumer culture .
but what escap@@ es from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of the time we live in .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission to do so .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly evolved sex robots appear at a time in which women &apos;s rights are threatened all over the world , in which there is a president in the White House who has bra@@ ced women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the winding physi@@ que and the ej@@ ected eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .
the aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as real@@ istically as technically possible ( if also with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply walk away .
they have no intermedi@@ ation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission .
in other words , they are pleasing slaves .
or to express it in the idi@@ om of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a tru@@ er of the Tr@@ ump Er@@ a that the political divisions that pol@@ arized US voters have also split families in small format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all ost@@ ensi@@ bly trying to burst out our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring families together .
I mention this because my cous@@ in , a le@@ aning poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and completely strange on the same side .
the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the issuing effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push us all to the right .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we talk about &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; we refer to the gru@@ es@@ ome possibility that one day his kit@@ ten will no longer be rep@@ elled . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , there is an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans the right wing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal@@ ises &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today I find myself affected by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ com@@ ical version of the mad - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal off@@ ence .
when Tr@@ ump is concerned , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Parks Department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need any caffeine .
the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the per@@ pen@@ di@@ cular music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the Top@@ ic Pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage doesn &apos;t count - but a big round@@ about in the north of London .
however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magic experience since two years old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have been able to judge the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but luckily no one asked for it .
on the other hand , during this week in a department store , I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where none is required .
the poor woman in the department store was dis@@ ap@@ pointing , while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain released from prison to hospital
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was hospit@@ alized due to the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to a case in his cell , according to the prison authorities .
after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of a first death sentence .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning of the Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he had his girlfriend for a noc@@ tur@@ nal intru@@ der hiding in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too len@@ i@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the National Prosec@@ ution Service said that it will appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the acqu@@ itt@@ al may be heard this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the fourth @-@ grade students from F@@ emen and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dischar@@ ged into holidays and secondary schools .
three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school .
the school manager An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Tuesday evening .
the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the lower band led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
peasant Arnold found a strange egg , and had it hat@@ ched by his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a hen out of him fell , and the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain .
after that , classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Y@@ von@@ ne Frank &apos;s studio .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young go@@ ck@@ les , carrying the cylinders to the bet .
the Adler stands for integration , said leader An@@ geli@@ ka Sit@@ te .
the kit@@ ten is different from the other young k@@ itt@@ ens ( ch@@ ick ) , but belongs to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ hour student to feel accepted in his new school .
it was followed by a word of thank@@ fulness to the colleagues , the former school@@ master Michael Müller , who always comes up with teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parent representatives .
the kitchen time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher explained .
after two years of teaching , she was reluc@@ tant to teach her students because it had been a really great time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally , they can rely on the vic@@ tors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the end , all students left a song of summer time and holiday time .
there was great joy with the children .
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on TV , announced .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal tents were arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway .
the State Department told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control over the free camp and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es .
the controls will be carried out throughout the season .
the Ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .
the emission characteristics of cars in the emission classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 are to be improved .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded from it .
Anja S@@ met@@ anine from ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates are freely tra@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mandatory updates before are only valid for the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Office of Transportation ( KBA ) has ordered their retro@@ fitting .
how and from when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced spe@@ edy implementation in the next few months , but not yet called an exact date .
Daimler informed every person affected .
if an inspection is due anyway , it will be settled into its framework .
how long will the retro@@ fitting fit in total ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this depends on the commitment of manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , voluntarily the car manufacturers do not act on the issue of the environment up to now . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
it could be more time @-@ consuming to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ ori@@ sts who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group ?
the ACE tells you to wait .
presum@@ ably , foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin .
does a massive decline in price of Euro @-@ 4 cars now thre@@ aten ?
the ACE is afraid of this .
but even in the regions where driving b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
up to now there is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .
the ACE tells us to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards by the renowned Kennedy Center .
this year , as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the Chore@@ ograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ all@@ ade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the scholars .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series already announced to abst@@ ain from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even depri@@ ving them of the means - and that bur@@ dened me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tr@@ ump to make her point of view clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
among the earlier prize winners are Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city life worth
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year .
the place has already been written out - however suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been a master builder for 31 years .
and the work is still great fun for him , as it is conveyed in the press talk .
he reports of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprising that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible date .
in this way - taking notice of the regular period of notice - shall be enough time for a famili@@ arization .
since Has@@ lach acts as a sub@@ contractor for the administrative community , the applicant has to present corresponding degrees .
because this function wants to keep the city on its own .
if they could no longer fulfil them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice .
but the proximity of the citizens is important to the city and itself , &quot; says W@@ acker , who reported a good working atmosphere and good atmosphere between the authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office some major projects have accumulated , on which W@@ acker looks back with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city life worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park are initiated .
the bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and the stadium rehabilitation is still a topic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will make a book with about 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
the work here is fun . &quot;
in terms of design , there is great scope for a city @-@ builder .
with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own construction yard and gar@@ dener ery , it is possible to react very flexibly to many things .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ acker , and the design of green spaces is often mentioned in praise by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town stands under monument protection as an ensemble , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what fits in &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going Stadt@@ bau@@ meister emphasizes .
in any case , the City Builder is responsible for high levels of responsibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is a client , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end everything is going over my table . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with care and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been with it for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wants his successor for a long time : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bicycle thrown on lines : Süd@@ bahnhof prohibited
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail@@ road crossing in the area of Le@@ oben Strasse ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male offen@@ ders and have been looking for them since the night hours .
near the crime scene , a sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond the borders of Lus@@ ati@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch on the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong@@ do@@ ers would have put themselves in great danger and endangered the train traffic as well .
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the costs for rail freight transport , pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also come to the offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; overall , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sum is to be assumed , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the southern track could be guided without disabilities .
there were barely ten passenger trains on Friday morning , two of which concerned tel@@ e traffic .
freight trains did not fall out , but they were late .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study claims just the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness .
while the person concerned is normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immune cells pat@@ rol in the intest@@ ines to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues .
if the equilibrium tends to go too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments , it was found that a type of tolerance prov@@ okes an immune cell in mice carrying a particular bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet toler@@ ant of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han will promote more toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ lie@@ us if the same system works with people .
the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan investigated a kind of immune cell that fav@@ ours tolerance when it found that a group of mice had such cells , but a different group of the same trunk , which was however divided , had not had that .
it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria present in the mice with the immune cells but lacking in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
to understand how the bacteria spread to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to im@@ mature immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers dup@@ licate the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of the mice , the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han properties were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i protect in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han &apos;s by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han properties in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an extension of this population . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million pound Sig@@ nature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last high season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , matic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League @-@ season .
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will help him to be ready earlier than later . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
besides M@@ atic Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u started in the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho used his start XI for the beginning of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Independent revealed in this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was still wishing three more new commitments , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fantastic job &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to meet three of its four priority new commitments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; three of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four for me , but they have given great effort . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
Boeing has drawn the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner to the sky .
the pilots flew from Seattle to Washington State , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. State Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a dre@@ am@@ liner over the United States , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertisement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new draft for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
but as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , Social Democratic Prime Ministers still looked at Berlin with a certain concern before elections .
only no fire from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the campaig@@ ners .
since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has fundamentally changed .
since then , the members of Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Mr Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with head@@ winds .
there were failures .
one after the other .
according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once more shows that red @-@ green cannot go@@ vern reliably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprise president of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ votes majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Gre@@ ens CEO Michael Kell@@ ner called on the back@@ sliding Lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ westen to give back their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Director and election campaign head of the Green Party to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an SPD election campaig@@ ner si@@ ghs when the new job message reached the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transfer of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without their own government majority .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD regional associations .
and nobody knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , not more , the comrades were cal@@ med at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
then it became - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel led the SPD to reel , the Düsseldorf @-@ bank@@ rupt@@ cy hau@@ led the party smoothly .
the comrades pain@@ stak@@ ingly ra@@ ged back in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just picked up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg .
and with him came the next draft .
mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because in crisis communication he made pretty much everything wrong , which can be done wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for his political survival .
so now Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ like atmosphere and its role in the supervisory board , the Lower Sax@@ on Prime Minister has been in the criticism for a long time already .
adjusted survey parameters were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps just for this reason , Wei@@ l tried to set new accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in Martin Schulz &apos;s periph@@ ery .
they let him give as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
at the same time , Wei@@ l is not responsible for the internal break @-@ up of the Lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here especially on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arian T@@ westen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Ms. T@@ westen poses her own career entran@@ ces over the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as direct candidate for her person but on the provincial list of the Lower Sax@@ on Gre@@ ens in parliament , according to the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony .
the logical consequence would be that she returns to her mandate .
Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the vote of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the SPD in Lower Saxony as the leading candidate to the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties distor@@ ts the election outcome , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or has given further commitments to the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local people III
those who want to renov@@ ate their home in the years can soon get support from the country .
in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg City Development informed in sens@@ ations on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information session Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a look back to what happened .
since 1991 it has been in sensation re@@ development areas .
back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote internal development and not only to develop new construction areas .
on April 4 , I received information from the government pres@@ idency of Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the sum of the funds amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euro came from the country , the rest of the community felt .
how does a rehabilitation area now come about ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; one will continue studying so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it also plays a role if there is any interest in the planned area to rehabil@@ itate .
if necessary , the area limits could then shift again .
the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund Project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where the re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ings would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be object @-@ related , that is , per property .
the re@@ development area would then finally be defined as by@@ laws .
the grant period for funding runs since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 .
until September this year , however , the inventory survey would only be carried out , within the scope of which the participants in the area of rehabilitation received a questionnaire for filling out .
in November or December , the statute is to be carried out as soon as possible , so that the renovation can begin in the coming year .
subsequently , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that each commun@@ e had to carry out the aforementioned investigations .
the aim is to evaluate the urban situation and decide when it is being renovated and to what extent .
there will be a re@@ organisation in the land register for the respective property .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that the project was a key success factor for the project .
that is why there will be questionn@@ aires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Building and Land Ar@@ cs &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; where , among other things , it concerns the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation intentions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and housing sheets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on size , distribution and residents of a residential area can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; operating sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is only to be filled when business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Got@@ zel showed that a completed questionnaire was not an application for funding at the same time .
in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding .
Sch@@ in@@ dler also stressed that the distribution of subsidies in accordance with the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; functions - who first comes , ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Local Center II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his front door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per castle .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the adverti@@ sers of the White House cost thousands of tax@@ pay@@ ers
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that is canc@@ eling American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military that was left to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 .
the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Navy One , when the president is on board was the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states .
the helicopter , made in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was exhibited beside a Ma@@ ine Yacht , a Wisconsin fire bri@@ g@@ ade and a Miss@@ issi@@ ppi forklift .
the White House military bure@@ au required the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the helicopter Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter .
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superior , the deputy commander of the nav@@ al aviation .
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning for the event at 3 o &apos;clock and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight .
the original air crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane .
from the records provided by TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second air crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could viol@@ ate the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the command@@ ant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sounds like you &apos;re locked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an imp@@ etus to the reform of the health reform underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Navy One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but to claim their use only for a photo op is unusual .
Tr@@ ump took an investigation in February when the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane presented in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; the White House is excited about the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights in the Washington area and in the South La@@ wn to de@@ duct the US President in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter records .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 performed 58 exercise land@@ ings in the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event counted in the training needs of the crew &apos;s crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
hel@@ i@@ cop@@ ter units flew in addition 11 hours on that day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not have budget@@ ary plans for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , however , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is $ 24.@@ 380 per hour .
records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine .
in the White House Tr@@ ump addressed Si@@ kor@@ sky &apos;s representatives and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress prepared a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the US offensive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages pun@@ ishing European companies that will help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the dr@@ y@@ tale is enormous .
nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .

Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is the center of the series of Net@@ fli@@ x
despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , who revealed Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x has not passed away for a long time .
the three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first one received their first trailer and showed the latest bad@@ dies of the show .
with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organisation of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kartell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 Company &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez O@@ re@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ re ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York .
in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns as J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , who invites American and Colum@@ bian prosecution authorities to support the war on drugs .
other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Sil@@ vest@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro .

r@@ ô@@ le backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the urban day@@ care centers , the clock is turned back .
the city of Kre@@ feld will take over the food supply in the urban day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) on September 1st .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cook will continue to cook out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and provides fresh gas .
the city runs 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the last kit@@ esur@@ fing year 28@@ 00 children were seated at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are taken care of 45 days of the week , eat in the K@@ ita at lunch , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time employees have a kitchen service from 1 September : they warm up the food delivered , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give off the meal , rinse , rinse and clean the kitchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the workers are permanently assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ anz says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the size - there are bil@@ l@@ boards as well as seven @-@ group@@ ed facilities - decides on the ho@@ ur@@ ly range .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen hero@@ ines are now a part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pom@@ er@@ anz sings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
because that &apos;s what it &apos;s all about : healthy eating and cooking lessons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen force to the team makes sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well @-@ known strength in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen staff - is done by special cleaning staff in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen , also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign assignment for the city as the most economically challenged , it is said of the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly hired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so strong at about 750 persons in the education sector , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including the women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , acting director of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be candidates in the Council elections in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of the Vice President and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are included in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Tali@@ ban have published threats against an election process that coinci@@ des with the transition from international fighting actions to an advisory role . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year the elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will reinforce the democratic success of Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Afgh@@ an independent electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million registered voters .

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 are said to have tried to ro@@ b a 13 year old girl on Thursday .
according to information from the police , the men talked to the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who was staying with friends at Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , at about 2.@@ 55 p.m. because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone .

without a prey , the du@@ et fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .

G@@ MB concern about investing in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make sure that the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie is responsible for the long @-@ term commitment to production at its Glasgow plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company out@@ weigh@@ ed the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
more than 500 employees work at the plant , which produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits in addition to other products .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and union representatives would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first experienced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the company manager of the company , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie claimed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to express concern that funding for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot win clarity about business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross affects our members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
generations of families have worked here and the workforce is strongly focused on the local community and the Greater Glasgow area , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed by a flour@@ ishing presence in production at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to it because we value the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives .
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with the employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility fully and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona have warned of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the site of La League may regret its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not abandon N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s pursu@@ it after having issued an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record case ?
the sens@@ ational approach has made the transfer window heated in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United over the past season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way outside , although there is a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans Council that the club always has its best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the World Cup warned against this prospect three years ago by the PS@@ G President ?
when Manchester City announced his interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect all clubs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to let one of our players sign in , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar .

on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um took the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au with his VW at 19.@@ 55 o &apos;clock in the direction of Le@@ ese .

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse attacks reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann means .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement , &quot; We are the Church , &quot; declared by the former Regen@@ s@@ burger bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ bodi@@ ment of Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , an ap@@ ology .
it would greatly serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger expressed their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican daily &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the other hand critic@@ ised the fact that reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen is measured with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in regard to the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people like to go to the church and that &apos;s a fres@@ her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; blows are a normal educational tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in their youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they find it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .
in connection with reports on abuse of abuse , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; totally wrong@@ ly , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann : &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the results of the final report .
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber by the dioc@@ ese of Regensburg ?
a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ( Dom@@ sp@@ atzen ) took place between 1945 and the early 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; Vic@@ tims of attack , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , sexually ab@@ used .
in the final report it is said to be Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who had been working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary it can be said that by R. Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied .
especially with high emotional appeal the punishment for the students could also be more violent .
nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims of general humanity were valued by R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are linked to him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 page report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incidents of non @-@ violence against protection ordered at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , he also appears as ch@@ ol@@ er@@ cian and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more pal@@ p@@ able when a domain atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all .
he is dedicated only once eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the horri@@ fic cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of his sphere of influence .
you can at best reproach him , know it too late or have not taken the first hints seriously enough .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the grammar school gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger presents a very excellent testimony , describing him as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who regularly nour@@ ished the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority compl@@ ains about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to rage out@@ breaks .
that he did not only cr@@ ush with chairs and cast the key ring on the ground , but also distributed ear @-@ cow@@ ards and pulled too fre@@ ak@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he himself already admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
for his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each of us was born before 1968 .
I also experienced that in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um .
in comparison to what is actually happening in this report , the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , it is certainly Bag@@ at@@ elles .
one wonders whether it has to do with his fame and role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just crashed onto him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian pop@@ e .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
in the media , a lot was reported in connection with the report on the topic mis@@ use of the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger being charged with regard to sexual abuse in the final report also in regard to sexual abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the master &apos;s master .
not even the parents were initiated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was , however , that most victims of shame are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen senior students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of the abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student thus formulated it : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had timely re@@ ali@@ zations and could have been able to stop the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I consider it ... also for really absurd to assume that it is calculated ... Bu@@ ben are more intru@@ sive , clearer , or more open than against their parents , dormit@@ ory leaders , trust@@ worthy teachers , etc .
that one talks about sex with him ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free from all co @-@ members .
thus it cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the display .
therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes , as it happened in some cases .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the media , there was a lot of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non@@ violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gaz@@ ing out &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and non@@ violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but that is exactly the abuse of the report .
there is a clean separation : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as , we say once , other alleg@@ ations .
the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not choir director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly chann@@ elled and mal@@ adjusted and suffered terri@@ bly , all at the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have prevailed .
but the master master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on that , as most of the witnesses stress , the subject &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tab@@ oo . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what was different from the gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was indeed discipline , but there was no sa@@ di@@ stic violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims under@@ estimated the general humanity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories link with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to have looked away .
but in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool .
the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and from his predec@@ essors at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again around 1993 .
in front of the states , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger resol@@ utely closed the ears ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , he continues to practice the punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended immediate intervention .
this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed as testing fin@@ es in Bavaria long ago banned .
before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each one of us knows still .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded .
but one cannot say that he had always looked away .
that simply doesn &apos;t work .
only in 1980 , the punishment of schools was officially aboli@@ shed in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to that time .
how do you see that ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sn@@ are of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. the danger to evaluate the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess was right there .
but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abom@@ in@@ able at all times and also not for what was bre@@ ached in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
it &apos;s all terrible and I &apos;m glad that it &apos;s finally being worked out .
but at the same time I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , such as sla@@ p and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then forbidden , he also strictly adher@@ ed to it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his rainy season has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in our conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject test drive also speak to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells from his perspective , the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role .
nevertheless , I did not by no means conc@@ eal that there was a strict regi@@ ment there .
but even that must be said once : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of un@@ conditioned discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ ce from the rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y alone , a rebel@@ li@@ ous boy will not once again be a great singer and before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of person did you see as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic ben@@ ign , deeply beli@@ ever and heart@@ felt people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do just a fly .
I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his exp@@ ul@@ sion , regularly contact him , visit him , read him , he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .
those who have not forgiven him to this day , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority .
most of the cathedral @-@ cats are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and has famili@@ arized them with the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still see and worship them today .
and please , once again clearly : all you submit to him are educational methods which were on the order of the day at that time .
we can be happy that we have long ago overcome this .
but it is highly un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious .
for the report that has just been published reli@@ eves him .
now the anarch@@ ist , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , probably no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
