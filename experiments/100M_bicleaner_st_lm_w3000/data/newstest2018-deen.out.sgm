<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A mine chapel, where it is now being dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers cultivate the rusty ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich supports exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows that, because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a circumfence.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but especially insightful.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">More detailed maps, so-called urpositional sheets, were incorporated into the large picture postcard for towns and villages.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian VerMessungsverwaltung between 1810 and 1864 and originate from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon was looking for an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic recording of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even though the French troops followed the peace of Lunéville on February 9th, 1801, it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a covering Bavaria map.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "Elector Max IV Josef drove the project forward, set up the" "" "Topographic Bureau" "" "- and thus the Bavarian Palace of surveying." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The Copyright Journal for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all other documents on the Bavarian State Library's website.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is the most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is subsendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was inscribed in the Munich District by 21 years after the map was created, 1877.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today, Untersendling lies in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses of Lower Saxony were concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the revolt of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in appears a small-part card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten numbered plots from the so-called "original recording" from which the land tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "small plots there are no more farmers there today - but farmers from the plant" "" "Land in the sun" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">Theresienwiese, which has been the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">In the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street names "at the Gasteig" or from the height "Auf der Lüften" - but also in big letters "Irren Anstalt."</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once closed people with madness.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "in 1858 / 59 the Munich-based" "" "Circle Irrenaissance" "" "was created" "" "On the Auer Ventilation" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was head of the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and, for example, finished fixing the so-called" "" "Irish" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">In addition, he has forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the prison.</seg>
<seg id="37">For 280 patients first place was first, and later was expanded to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity did not suffice anymore - the reason for the construction of the gyro-center in hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet in the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order purchased the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children's house" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built - in architectural reference to the original construction of the Irrenaissance, which had been destroyed during WWII during bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">"" "the Marienplatz was registered as" "" "Main Square" "" "around 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" "" "Kaufinger Gasse" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War brought a decisive change also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs destroyed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remains to this day - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English Institute, small business houses and a mine chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line-line takes place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill up the hole at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group Announces Travel Warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Farmers has issued a warning for colourful people who travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls afro-american travelers, visitors and Missouri to pay special attention when travelling through the State, as a number of questionable, race-based incidents occur in the whole country and be noted here," it says in the group's opinion.</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently passed Bill of Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to accuse discrimination, as well as the State Law Enforcement Agencies that disproportionately target minorities, led the group to release the warning, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the president of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he no longer had any gasoline while traveling through the state and was arrested by the Missouri police without blaming a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri General Public Office, showing that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more likely to be employed as whites.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be ready to bring in chewing money or let the relatives know they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime report of the FBI, which classifies the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th place of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">"" "" "" "the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination." ""</seg>
<seg id="65">Previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed immigration laws which oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people on immigration violations, which will contribute to the further racial profile according to ACLU.</seg>
<seg id="66">Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately stakeholders have used the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">The fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weighaun Project is a successful project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of parliament Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac made a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU city association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met in the court yard of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into his company, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals, and houses holiday palaces in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Black Forest milk" "" "is the alternative marketing route for him for the milk of his cows, says Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste comes exclusively Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fishermen, he described the broadway project as" "" "fundamental importance" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't win on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland area provides for a lot of work, much had to be machined with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have to fight here with the conditions and topography," "" "said Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the parental farm and carried out this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not run a bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader-support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they continue their business," "" "emphasised the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticized for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">In 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants.</seg>
<seg id="85">The reserve area is therefore 40 hectares, which must not be enforced until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">The total cost of 71 500 euros was given by half by Leader, a quarter contributed by the Municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">The farmers thus remained twelve 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 km of soft fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," said Schwendemann.</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac emphasized: "you do a really good job, without farmers and landowners, it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter Weiß asserted: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The state-of-the-art partnership (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg allows state funding of soft fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is the openness of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the presence of a conveyor set indicated by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">In addition, the area to be enforced will not be flippery (slope above 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation.</seg>
<seg id="95">The application of eight participants with 24 plots, which would build just under 16 kilometres of fence, is currently under construction for the Fishermen Weiobello Project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The area of maintenance is equivalent to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 11,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Baghdad's Square in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump-Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN about the President's proposals for the drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue herself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty agitators would have gynted him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But it attested its importance, and in particular the importance attributed to it, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">As Miller Acosta insulted, "I don't want to go down to a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world.</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem that you refer to later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is improperly correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who longs to breathe freely, the poor waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "miserable trash" "" "on our screens was better to see." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that those people in Trumps USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who used to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they took up a highly political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the links between French and American republicans by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical picture.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem, the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem to the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, bringing the American flame to the world's surrounding world: "Lady Liberty moves forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch should not enlighten the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Rather unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is quite and even a matter of point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as seen by the exhausted, miserable but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Their torch will not illuminate the way, but ignite hatred that is their only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the Great Britain team</seg>
<seg id="130">The High Field Artistic Director of the UK, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship team will make a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017, which kicks off on Friday.</seg>

<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m route, while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as a team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is rather modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Their captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"" "" "" "a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated." ""</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the genuine feeling that Eilidh brought in quite naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in the 400-m hurdles at her fifth World Championships, says that it is "incredible" that 16 Scots are in the British team.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-range runner Muir runs along this path and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs.</seg>
<seg id="148">Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season, which included the victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary games.</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle is reminded of her first World Championships, when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "immensely proud" of the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also medals and finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates tuned for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the clothes that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">What concerns my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the heat up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the papers struck him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He knocked at the critique, sure.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "because in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">That brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan, who must work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union complained to him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"" "the governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a backlash with" "" "Na, and?" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"" "" "" "it's only Facebook," "" "said many people." ""</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to draw his hair-loose head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">That is why the blocking of persons who come to the Governor's side - which is a public forum, officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing but a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to the Catholic faith of Hogans.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the comments section of the news program "The Post."</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, then some are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and are not recognized as a large group of citizens affected."</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the Governor's employees referred to as" "" "concentrated spam assault," "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to trim a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corpses, or to arrest or arrest demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what is happening digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>

<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable port had a similar effect as the internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters fell on his lead.</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed they had belated that they had mistakenly traveled with guns, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey was conducted with more than 1,000 people - a Jet Charter Service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., was carried out - it also stated that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents who admitted that they have knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA were 19.7 percent millennials compared to less than 15 percent who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items abused by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 per cent admitted, knowingly worn items with blades by security control while 2.2 percent of the female respondents and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the plane.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it was asking travelers throughout the country to find out how many inadvertently brought smuggled goods through airport security and how many would have deliberately done it.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk is happy to present with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">It has undergone so far that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla boss Elon Musk once again betrayed another, less dazzling figure in the announcement of the recent quarterly assessment: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">During the past few months, Musk has often advertised more than 500,000 reservations for the new car, whose delivery just begins.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk dreamed: 63,000 had already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 reservations.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In the event of a cancellation, Tesla pays the 1000 Euro (in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds) "reservation payment" completely.</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 of such non-binding reservations accrue to Musk in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to twelve percent of all orders could be addressed.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge in ambitious growth targets is not on demand, but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be taken together - 500,000 by 2020, one million.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obvious.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Who orders today a "Model 3" may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tesla creates his brand new production lines which have never been tested in practice without major interruptions with maximum capacity utilization.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if it comes to greater delays, then the non-binding of the reservations may become a problem for Tesla.</seg>

<seg id="440">One day after being sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, withdrew his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules to reduce the emissions of smoke-causing air pollutants.</seg>
<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when his agency turned out to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint that had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a deadline agreed on 1 October for States to comply with the standards set out in 2015 for ozone-related ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"" "Pruitt told in June that he would delay the observance of a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid" "" "interfere in local decisions or hinder economic growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was due to President Donald Trump's prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly failed to block or delay regulations to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist.</seg>
<seg id="447">"" "" "" "the sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legislative setback for the Pruit regulatory rollback agenda." ""</seg>

<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruck proposed that his reversal of ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with states by the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under earlier administrations, the EPA has often not followed the deadlines for carrying out and then waiting to be charged by activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who complained the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="451">"" "" "" "we do not believe in regulation by judicial proceedings, and we take deadlines seriously." ""</seg>

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>

<seg id="465">Tumlingen celebrates 750 Years of St. Hilarius Church</seg>
<seg id="466">750 Years of St. Hilarius-Kirche: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen is invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16th July at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in town have made friends and promoters of Tumlingen their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini emphasizes:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">The St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the year 1267: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen and the Vogtei "to the Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">The wording of the document, in addition to the former parish church, was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the patronage right belonged, and not the other way round.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As it emerged from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, the "Berg" was the third, the glorious settlement centre of the village, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to the year 1600 have undergone these historical facts.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronism arose from early medieval property law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A gentleman who built a church, and occupied it with a priest, remained the owner of this church and could also bequeathed this church.</seg>
<seg id="478">It was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The bigger ones of the two were torn to Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The new bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the window panes were hammered and the bell pieces were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">Remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869, the Hilarius Cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from the listeners.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the bell tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night in 1834 a storm splits the bell tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">In order to prevent misfortunes, the tower was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem cherish the "Schaffhausen pensioners" as successors of Dieter Dockhorn the Hilarius system.</seg>
<seg id="494">As organisers, the friends and promoters invite Tumlingens on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade on the old cemetery of St. Hilariuskapelle.</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of Kepler High School Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">The town hall Hartmut Romann refers to the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">To the end of the Serenade a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery.</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows up to the forest," the organisers expose the fantastic view.</seg>
<seg id="501">The Serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">The organisers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius complex, which is of importance for tumors and listeners.</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and promoters of Tumlin feel particularly committed to home care, as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirmed.</seg>

<seg id="505">"" "" "" "Boisheim defends itself" "" "does not see a legal precondition for construction and therefore has turned to the councillor." ""</seg>
<seg id="506">"" "the association" "" "Boisheim" "" "has called upon Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette." ""</seg>
<seg id="507">It may be illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 no wind turbines could have been approved at all, because at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal a wind power zone exists.</seg>
<seg id="509">In this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines is fundamentally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind power utilization for the rest of the city.</seg>
<seg id="510">Such zones should prevent "asparagus cultivation" of the landscape.</seg>
<seg id="511">Although a few days earlier, the city of Viersen had decided by a change in the land use plan a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but the district government did not approve Düsseldorf because of a mould infallible.</seg>

<seg id="520">The NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, plans the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheimer Nette.</seg>
<seg id="521">Already last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had leases contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">The construction of the four wind turbines is expected to cover the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - equivalent to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's municipal councillor gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the windpark Linnich near Aachen, as well as a participation in a wind turbine in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="546">But also many local people lost sight of the inner city while shopping.</seg>
<seg id="547">In the end, everyone would have to contribute to enliven the inner city - to landlords, the factories of the whole city and clubs.</seg>
<seg id="548">It was a good idea to overcome the lethargy with a network that was partly broadened, in the spring of the year.</seg>
<seg id="549">"" "Birgit Streich, head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen, announced that the third" "" "home-shopping" "" "day, for the first time five Thuringia cities, took part in the nationwide" "" "home shopping" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in steinfurt in the furniture exchange, once a week I spend here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in the open whole day.</seg>

<seg id="691">Quantity: I have graduated from high school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a construction engineer, let's say, successfully stopped.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something different with people.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British education group Pearson said on Friday that she will reduce further 3,000 jobs and trim their dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing.</seg>
<seg id="720">Job cuts, announced by the Director General John Fallon, for the end of 2018 and early 2019, are in addition to its previous restructuring, where already 4,000 points have been lost.</seg>
<seg id="721">In May in a third cost-cutting program, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business that was hit by the rapid pace of digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="724">A suicide bomber attacked a military convoy in Kabul Afghan capital, killed a NATO soldier and injured several others, say officials.</seg>
<seg id="725">Five soldiers and one interpreter were injured, shared an explanation of NATO.</seg>
<seg id="726">According to unconfirmed local reports, three civilians died in the Qarabagh district.</seg>
<seg id="727">The bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Herat on Tuesday.</seg>
<seg id="728">On Monday, a suicide bomber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="729">In an opinion of NATO, it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening has occurred when a joint patrol with the Afghan army was attacked by a "improvised explosives."</seg>
<seg id="730">The statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the Bagram airfield.</seg>
<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bagram.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there was at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% of them in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, a suicide bomb killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had done this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On May 31, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly military attack in the country, since the US-led troops crushed the Taliban in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">The violence underlines the precarious level of security in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops supporting military and police in the country.</seg>
<seg id="737">Correspondents say that in the past weeks the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government, their policies, and especially in the call of President Ashraf Ghani.</seg>

<seg id="739">The U.S. Environmental Protection Authority has a decision to delay regulating the Obama administration, which states that states are obliged to curb smog-causing emissions. this happened a day after 15 states complained to the agency because of the step.</seg>

<seg id="747">Community wants common room</seg>
<seg id="748">At the end, the decision was clear: with two counterparts, the Municipal Council of Fluestrels decided to set up a common room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the still missing part of the property was signed, mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports.</seg>
<seg id="750">Although it will still take a while before the church community has so far been part of the community, there is no planning obstacle for the project to be stemmed by a private investor.</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common space.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">On the ground floor, it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price.</seg>
<seg id="754">The administration and the majority of the council are afraid of not seeing such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the righteous living, but open to the community.</seg>
<seg id="755">As an example, the word from "Knitting Café" made the round.</seg>
<seg id="756">The decision which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the current household was decided by funding opportunities already last autumn.</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is located in the refurbishment area.</seg>
<seg id="758">The establishment of a common room would be, according to Tjades, capable of handling 60 percent of 30 percent.</seg>
<seg id="759">The proposed proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect it is not possible to throw clubs between the legs, the finding that both the articulated truck is leaning against the surrounding construction - as well as the pent roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical.</seg>
<seg id="760">Needless, not only Wilfried Sohmer means, be this additive.</seg>
<seg id="761">If it helps: he does the body unanimously.</seg>
<seg id="762">It's not that easy with the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "Daniela Ruf points to the many of its own buildings, with which one should not be so right now, for that, one now backs up in the common room out of the window, she says:" "" "I am very difficult with it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a community participation.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to investors who are already wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">That is not the case, because with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsidy, but a real counter-value which is in the doubt of doubt, is the counter-speech.</seg>
<seg id="767">Staiga's request to split the proposed resolutions is three advocates.</seg>
<seg id="768">It remains with two counterparts in the original program, which sums up Stefan Haller: "if we take the decision this way, we make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="908">The building is scheduled for October, and it is certain that the schedule will be adhered to.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads over the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is an arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come to the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and traffic safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The two other bridges lead over the Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already provided with the patented bridge caps.</seg>
<seg id="923">Particular delicacy has required the laying of cables through the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed in advance of the work by handouts on the project.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the finance rules of football affect Neymars Moving to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded expenditures of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">"" "" "" "financial Fair Play rules, which were launched by UEFA in 2011, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses." ""</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to extract Brazilians out of their contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of tens of millions of dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars moving to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make money easy for Neymar to sign and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, in view of the funding of the team through the power-rich master family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players, but they must counteract legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break even point in their football-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini following his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a tougher issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, Clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the Presidency of 2015, his successor Aleksander Ceferin will continue to be deterred by excessive spending.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the proceeds for the next five years will be deducted from 44,4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of €60 million (then 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to €20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the usual 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income by businesses associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a Qarusian enterprise might sponsor the PSG, if the value of sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, UEFA would not allow it to be regarded as a legitimate income.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsor had been inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that a portion of Neymar's PSG payments could come on payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar's 2022 are contested that Neymar's World Cup ambassador is going to be and such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to ignore the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preliminary discussions with PSG on Neymars transfer, said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports reveal that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year still have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymars removal by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last owner at PSG.</seg>

<seg id="1184">This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80's, for the 90-year Grunge era (when the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy "The State" for MTV) and for themselves - that is, for 2001, before their stars, like Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things.</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">The lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now a romantic author, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau).</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another insane-vicious plot involved in the Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, exams are the best part of franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's lip beard of "singles," whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy is now feeling like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental madness that could heat this franchise like a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I consider his logical conclusion: "Wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later," whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War from "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even to "GLOW" with its East-versus-West Rwling Iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy with Rhys Thomas, created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka, is to be a found TV show: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth, atheism and the path of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also a executable producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it's not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice flags to watch (the police spend the time watching chess on TV, as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">And the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game of 'Find out the voice'.</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or often enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"" "" "" "Comrade Detective" "" "who was edited to a lower length could better deliver his agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers." ""</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court Apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resigned from a large house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"" "" "" "I was looking for something comparable to my prize." ""</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot has been completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not just a development, but also a place to live for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the spaces in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Using mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all pots and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Collapsible kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art went in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it's very important, so it's very easy to slide the door when pushing the door." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and make a calculation based on the ground size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that touch you and are therefore helping to create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "" "" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls." ""</seg>
<seg id="1352">"" "these are important, but they do not play with your heart." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can be transformed by a good design and an increased square footage of somewhat standard into something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you might decide not to leave this.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a dispute over one of the largest real estate imperialisms of Victoria in the value of over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors away from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to divide their property and business assets.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth over half a billion dollars, accumulated since the family purchased a business at Smith Street, Collingwood in 1973.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, Brunswick and Sorrento's development areas, the Gold Coast and Mt Buller apartments as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as "main operator and the dominating personality" is described in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin has a value of $316 million and Paul has a value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The breakdown of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I kept for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now fight for control of the existing business - from which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but accuses Paul to manage some possessions incompetent.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early ape-vit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise in the event, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and both sides held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Ms. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicatessens from the late 1950's and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood Property, where Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to bounce her property kindly to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark has paid $10 million and Luke 26 million when leaving the company.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark were," "" "Paul" "" "said about the conditions of their financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin held back very much, although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the television stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin responded by SMS to say" "" "I can really not say much" "" "because the case is in front of the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it's very sad that my brother Paul decided to dress me up and draw our surname through the dishes," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">POLITICO reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here's a piece by reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the White House's new Chief of Staff, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem to President Donald Trumps White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the president's hands.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Waiter's diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by overseeing his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was annoyed because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs to convince," "" "said the former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keeping Trumps's Twitter custom is under control, according to six former election campaign officers to ensure that personal media consumption has a constant praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay. okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"" "but the idea that Trumps Twitter custom ever" "" "under control" "" "is ridiculous." ""</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials know something that we don't know for others - that Trumps tweets would have contained even more combustible material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump hasn't sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him a few times, their efforts paid off.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent dump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to present their own agenda by presenting Trump Material that possibly promotes their views of the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">POLITICO - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to provide questionable information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former trump officials say that pumping like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he can get out of where they come from." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">It happened at the end of February when someone maliciously issued a copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh, "to be the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson has been permanently banished from Twitter for chicanes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false allegations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "Trump read the article and started asking people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">Goldmacher also added that the then Chief of Staff, Reince Priebus, and the General Secretary of the White House, Rob Porter, "tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that the Trump receives."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1445">The former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently under renovation and is to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Birkenhof through the then Ambiente business company ltd. on April 13, 2014, around 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income by the tourist tax.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees coming to the administrative district, the hotel building was offered to the district office as a collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not uncontested at that time in the municipal council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all, Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald has defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisendas with managing director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary increase in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">You are greeted Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1458">At the earlier Hotel Birkenhof, building shuttles have been in front of the entrance for quite some time, and when entering the house, it becomes clear what extensive renovations are carried out.</seg>
<seg id="1459">The floors have been pulled out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs are removed from the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it's actually a lovely place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1465">"" "everything should later become" "" "pretty petty-bourgeois" "" "as Thomas Scherer expresses himself." ""</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it."</seg>
<seg id="1467">Swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment.</seg>
<seg id="1468">One does not want to position itself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on a upscale downtown level, Scherer says.</seg>
<seg id="1469">The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to spread wide, Scherer continues to explain.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Individual holidaymakers, groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="1471">Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourism director Michael Krause, he has already led, so shearers.</seg>
<seg id="1472">The ideas of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Thomas Scherer doesn't want to define exactly the amount of investments desired.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Just under one million euros, he calculates.</seg>
<seg id="1476">The external systems are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible.</seg>
<seg id="1477">A large terrace is created in a courtyard, which is open to the public from the restaurant, which is open to the public.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia Affair: us Special Issuer sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, special promoter Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "in recent weeks, the committee accepted the work, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "referring to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there are already preliminary charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to have been specifically blamed into the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation will focus on several men acting as advisers to the republicans in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to reports Mueller took a close look at more and more trumps for private and business environments.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Issuer Trump has moved personally to the center and accused the accused of having impeded the President in the course of the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Juries is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand jurys are therefore also called ankle buntings.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on when dealing with larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite persons to the company under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the station CNN, invitations were already issued which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Those who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. was also Trumps consultant and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign chief Paul Manafort in the conversation.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that enforcement shows that Mueller should not intimidate himself in his work and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">However, the implementation of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump.</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, on Thursday evening, the president used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the topic gives the democrats a way to" "" "feel good, because they have nothing else to talk about." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1504">His Special Advisor Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he did not know anything about the composition of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">But this also usually works secretly, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any action that accelerates the work of the special finder in a" "" "fair" way "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it was not determined against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">There is no reason to assume that something has changed from it, it was stated in the statement.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this dismissal, accusations against dump have become loud, he refused to obstruct the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey said in June in front of a Senate Committee, Trump asked him for a set of investigations against the national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to the representation of US media, the White House gathered material against the special promoter and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to divorce.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent specialist of the Congress, such as the Watergate affair surrounding the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the insistence of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">However, several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented draft laws on Thursday, after which the promoter could no longer be dismissed so easily.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs in the region for some 30 years, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now aborted colossus has so far been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It therefore continues to grow in the sea and periodically breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this archipelago was the balance between waxing and breaking down a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete Shelf is broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never gone so far as currently.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet stands under tension and can be broken if a piece fails at a key point.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as it flows after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of sweat causes glaciers to flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">According to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest shelf of Antarctica with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean approximately 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most popular withdrawal since the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Among scientists is arguing whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow back or go back in the long term and possibly fall together, "said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even though these researchers are not returning this gigantic iceberg to climate change, many of the Antarctic Peninsula's mischievances have fallen apart in recent decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long tail of Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme, the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula was warmed up by about three degrees in the last 50 years and thus became one of the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif to staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacant jobs, the CDU asks us to step out of the employers' association in order to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Only shortly before the summer break, the Cretaceous day 41 new positions in the administration have penetrated.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1,100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now 17 trainees have finished their first working day.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The apprenticeships in the circle are obviously very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be awarding this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">However, the circle is still lacking in staff to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Currently, there are 50 vacancies in the Mettmann district.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, the search for doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration.</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU now wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and counter the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "the administration shall work out" "" "a concept for personnel development and personnel development" "" "according to the wish of the parties." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to meet short-term demand for skilled workers but to counteract the future oriented application shortage, is called it.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for lateral entrants and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "the speech is of a regular" "" "competition of the public employers" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">In addition, there is a high number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age due to age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Thus the highest time for action so that no more places remain unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, goes beyond the common application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He already provided a lazy surprise on the day of his circle when he questioned the personnel costs and amazed the other parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be checked which allow an exit from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the district administration with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aim at a hourly rate," "" "says Peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials than it actually envisages the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are now exactly prescribed, increases or more money only exists if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle grew more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act.</seg>
<seg id="1578">Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers, Landrat Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirektor Martin Richter have a problem: they have too few staff.</seg>

<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German relief organisation 'Youth Retention' because their team had effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to comment on detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, saving human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organisation in an opinion on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only assess any accusations currently being collected after collecting all the information and judging the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">The Italian authorities had watched the boat from 'Youth Retention', the Iuventa, since October.</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is assumed that its crew is carrying dinghy migrants on board, which are delivered directly to them by human traffickers, and that the smugglers can depart so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the acts of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of overthrowing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats like the Iuventa must primarily have an Italian police officer on board who oversees their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>

<seg id="1594">In the meantime, Minniti has said that the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga gears up for e-sports</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars in the future sit in front of computer consoles instead of being sweaty over the stadium racing during wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact is: e-sport has long been a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">The first Bundesligavereine, who are increasingly involved in this area, have also recognized this.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later followed by FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17.</seg>
<seg id="1617">"" "" "" "we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the VfB," "" "says CEO Jochen Röttgermann." ""</seg>

<seg id="1619">Next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first "Interactive Club World Cup," where gamers of different clubs compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1620">In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football must, in particular, deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian ones.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-athletes under contract you could be more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Bundesligamannschaft in Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">In the E-Sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike" or just the FIFA World Cup match FIFA at competitive level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, lilies have long established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the 2022 season E-Sport is already part of the official program.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it all about a right kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the idea is certainly getting used to.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Even Ingo Frobben had a long time dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sport University in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classic sport - such as increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capacity.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"" "but he also sees problems:" "" "doping becomes more and more a topic." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">Checks are difficult for online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing.</seg>
<seg id="1639">The scientists emphasise the high integrative effect of the E-Sports.</seg>
<seg id="1640">Players are on the road internationally, which is like a big global family, there are no cross-cultural barriers.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts rapid growth for e-sports.</seg>
<seg id="1642">In 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and large tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">Sales totalled 130 million in three years.</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is little against the nearly 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga.</seg>

<seg id="1680">The case seems to be a legal precedent, as there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to call for another to commit suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case drew national attention after Carter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, leap from a building, climb yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family.</seg>
<seg id="1684">In the moments before his suicide it wrote: "you must do it, Conrad" and "Everything you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz told that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1751">One day before the announcement of Audi, BMW said that it would offer to update the software in over 350,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The BMW president said the company believes that "there are smarter options as driving restrictions," and was referring to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to forbid or restrict diesel vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as revocation.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma.</seg>
<seg id="1757">The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutralization of exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive.</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of outing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">The companies try to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested, but driving back under normal driving conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1760">In the United States, several Volkswagen were indicted, others are being examined on both sides of the Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="1761">Last month, the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the motor development of Audi in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1762">The former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1763">At the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States has been expanded.</seg>
<seg id="1764">The inclusion of Audi into the investigation could weigh heavily on Volkswagen: the luxury car manufacturer contributes proportionately to Volkswagen profit.</seg>

<seg id="1779">"" "his message: laughter," "" "For there is too much suffering in the world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first few years as an artist, he proposed, among other things, as an artist for greeting cards - which frustrates him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he said once.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China, Mordillo had many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Again and again the artist was inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, roundish Mordillo figurines cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his personal data, he still sits on the table today, works nearly ten hours a day.</seg>
<seg id="1788">On calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, T-shirts, stuffed animals and watches, his cute figures continue to spread worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1789">For six years he has been working on a cartoon film and a TV series with his figures.</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the main person in the film" "" "Crazy Island" "" "is a giraffe - Mordillos favorite animal in his drawings - which has a thousandth companion as a counter-player." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">For the first time, his figures speak in the 3D film, which is scheduled to come onto the screen in 2019.</seg>
<seg id="1792">"I don't know exactly what they will say, it's strange for me," says Mordillo.</seg>
<seg id="1793">The script is not written by him.</seg>
<seg id="1794">That is why he rather relies on the TV series, which, like his original drawings, is wordless.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Lavender from Provence threatened by climate change</seg>
<seg id="1796">He has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and the insect-transmitting insects, what scientists and farmers who try to find solutions are causing great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years, which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the fall.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small cikade, a micro-bacterium that transmits dwarf cicades, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much at stake.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil not only attracts tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">Eric Chaisse said: "instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened.</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>
<seg id="1805">The solutions that are considered include better distribution of water and the slowdown of evaporation from the soil, but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The members of the weekly Riodoce weekly meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They have been told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts wrote three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's payroll list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no break from violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are subject to attacks and threats under federal protection and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter are their editors and their inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is everywhere - a big photo of Valdez, showing his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a special public prosecutor's office was established in 2010, in order to process the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although they are inconsolent and even though the terrain is now more treacherous.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefits, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we're suspicious of everyone." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically nothing to silence on the topic of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of studded, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">"" "forget for a minute that there is a state of" "" "peace" "" "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States." ""</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, was broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have angered the sons, presumed aisle runners bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second fault was not to force Valdez following the seizure of another newspaper, which had published the same story to leave the country for its own security.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues had accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars holdings.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the dowry-dowry problem," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after Riodoce was founded, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year Valdez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the persecution of Mexican drug history, wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"" "" "" "I want to continue living," "" "he said at the time of the CPJ award." ""</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "" "is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompviento TV." ""</seg>

<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who could curb like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">"" "now they ask:" "" "was his love of routine his ruin?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home runways," "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">The anger is, the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing is going on with Javier."</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the room where the employees of Riodoce met for safety training, no cell phones suddenly were allowed. days before it was known that spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-range quarter of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers belonged to the 50 percent of the police officers who were not trustworthy.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has focused on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former famous Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to government spending, concentrating on the home town of the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group living in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Office, a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which reigned almost all the political planes throughout the century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"" "Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" "" "El Chapo" "" "Guzman escaped a military attack." ""</seg>
<seg id="1883">Just a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez were considered to be the best informed source of the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"" "" "" "earlier we had known what happened," "" "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "" "El Flaco" "" "because of his slender body." ""</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and went the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his.</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists have become louder across the country by writing "SOS Press" on walking paths and buildings in organized protests.</seg>
<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the justice in the Valdez case.</seg>
<seg id="1892">At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and omit them because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has been asked since then to be regrouped by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a indifferent society.</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book, "Narco-journalism," he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who put under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>
<seg id="1896">"" "last year, the media" "" "Articulo 19" "" "media group assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists from the police and officials." ""</seg>
<seg id="1897">"" "" "" "in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "" "said Ramirez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect.</seg>

<seg id="1931">He hit something out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil, discovered by him, was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They spent the next six years in covering the wild animal within the 2,500 lund (1,100 kg) heavy Earth-clump.</seg>
<seg id="1934">After all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed.</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">Researchers have found out that this herbivorous, although covered with armor and resembles a moving tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as a counter-shading that is also used by many modern animals.</seg>
<seg id="1939">This would have allowed itself to better mix in its surroundings and to avoid its enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli to the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully.</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing preservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">They discovered the shading, a widespread defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to the fact that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure by eating meat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the shadowing - think of deer, zebras or shingling animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this dossier was exposed to a real fight for survival.</seg>
<seg id="1947">"" "" "" "strong predator behavior on a massive, strongly corded dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators must have been in the chalk period," "" "Brown said." ""</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to examine the animal for clues about his life, including his conserved bowels, to find out what it had eaten as his last meal.</seg>
<seg id="1950">They believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea.</seg>
<seg id="1951">At that time, Alberta was as warm as South-Floorida today, and rivers and oceans probably farther farther inland than they are today.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with conserved skin, but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," Brown said.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"" "" "" "the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period." ""</seg>

<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, standing on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years to Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his frightening ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the ocean and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he pitted on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips hanging from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the panzated herbivores were swept through the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater equipment of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the bonnet still cover bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur.</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I approach it, the more confusing it will.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified rests of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates bearing the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">His right foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upwards.</seg>

<seg id="1972">Violent accident on Thursday evening at the A8: nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass arrestation.</seg>
<seg id="1973">There are numerous wounded, kilometre-long staus and gaffer.</seg>
<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8), about 20 people were injured at a mass arambolage on the late thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">According to the police, at 5 p.m., between the connections between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg), almost 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, crashed into each other during a thunderstorm.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There are no indications of the exact number of injured persons.</seg>
<seg id="1977">A police spokesman said it was light to moderate injuries.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large range of emergency vehicles was at the scene of the accident.</seg>
<seg id="1979">The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="1980">In the direction of Munich, a ten-kilometre back-up was formed.</seg>
<seg id="1981">As an AZ reporter reports, it was also on the counter-track to massive disabilities - by numerous gaffers.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle bodies, which now have to be reckoned with with sensitive penalties.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Shortly after 18: 45 a second accident occurred on the A8, this time between Augsburg and Dasing.</seg>

<seg id="1993">The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the trouble-free ticket inspection.</seg>

<seg id="1999">In order to be able to use this, however, some requirements have to be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - which already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">You also have to buy it via the app of the railway, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient type of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">And finally you need a seat reservation.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Because the "comfort check-in" works like this: you get into the train, call his ticket under "My Tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2004">The test customer then appears as a button for the electronic devaluation.</seg>
<seg id="2005">The train attendants receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">When the train attendant arrives at PLAY Y, he knows that there is a passenger with an already paid online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">So you can continue to sleep, continue to work, keep quiet.</seg>

<seg id="2012">Those who travel often know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspections are one of the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often, however, one of the travelling companions does not have all the documents needed for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to present.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to bad mood in the part or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And this also applies only to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">Only one day after she arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment, which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on her phone.</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled upon a post from someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"" "" "" "the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2024">Confused, as no one else posted the information on her feed, she joined Facebook and opened Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly being saved on her timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The rapper from the area of St. Louis was there, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, who was killed live by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo.</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of a brownless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought.</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her mobile phone back in order to return to Tweet on the Canfield Drive in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There were photos of the police band and people shouting, and by a man who claimed to be Brown's father who wore a sign with the inscription: "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She observed a live feed where a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"" "in another video, she said, another policeman secured his rifle and shouted," "" "I am going to kill you... animals all." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"" "I was angry and wept." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After landing at 11pm she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary, "Whose Streets?," in the cinemas from the 11th.</seg>
<seg id="2041">It is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and power of resistance which consists of the point of view of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers.</seg>
<seg id="2042">When Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who carried a flower-dress and a suitable crown, the two discussed a conversation that they had "on the black experience and the black state countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"" "" "" "you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "" "she remembered what she said." ""</seg>

<seg id="2049">Even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different than the next black women child.</seg>
<seg id="2050">"" "I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">The first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which became a camp area when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officers Darren Wilson.</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter were connected with a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed totally after 9 August," she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"" "it's all here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2058">Weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film.</seg>
<seg id="2059">"" "Folayan said she and her mate Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "" "document" "" "what happened." ""</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question came to Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advantage of?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">This skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2062">"" "as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" "" "we had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2063">Folayan already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates.</seg>
<seg id="2064">His engagement led Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other natives, the team of "Whose Streets?" went after Browns shooting in the years.</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we speak," Davis said.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"" "" "" "this was the main thing for me as these people are represented, because I will be portrayed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2067">The goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the Movement "is not a Messiah leader, but a community that comes together," Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film.</seg>
<seg id="2068">As a result, documents of "Whose Streets?" are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr's life, as she falls in love and marries her wife.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"" "" "" "I felt like naked," "" "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time." ""</seg>
<seg id="2070">"" "" "" "but I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the nationalization of black people." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2071">In addition, Ferr's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Matter movement.</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founders of the movement, who after the death of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film "BlackLivesMatter" in social media, identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Black, gay women must carry the brunt of everything. "</seg>
<seg id="2075">"" "Folayan agreed to note that" "" "the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2076">"" "however, it insists that" "" "this is not an affirmatively type of action" "", "where Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film based on its identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said.</seg>
<seg id="2078">"" "" "" "it's not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life at these junctions as a black, gay woman is so much at stake." ""</seg>

<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>

<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "megalomania": TV readers talk about bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people, although it has not yet been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping mall at the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population into proponents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The issue is hardly cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg," the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">While the one-bit gallery says: "that would be a dream" (Anja Becker) or "That would be great" (Nicole Scots), comes from the other side: "don't need a human" (Siggi Betzen) or simply: "megalomania!" (Lars Scholz).</seg>
<seg id="2094">While proponents build on a gallery to attract more customers into the city, the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian area is bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2095">In addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property in which the farmers market hall stands where 13 direct marketing products offer their products.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This will conclude with the beginning of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery owners want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>

<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">But since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains.</seg>
<seg id="2111">After all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly offered directly by the producer and is well-priced at the top.</seg>
<seg id="2112">As you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rents there are often not portable to a retailer.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portrait with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, almost imperceptible - hanging from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being secretly graduated from the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition, which was opened on 2 August, is called A Becoming resemblance (An appropriate similarity).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and groundbreaking dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg has created through the algorithmic analysis of DNA, which was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look a sharp, although somewhat intellectual comment not only to the formation of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since she puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the Espionage Act, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white selfie in which Manning sits visibly on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the big success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette butts and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the trash to produce a picture of how these people could look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in jail, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted the Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned Muse have become unequal Brieffors who exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic "Suppressed Images," which foresaw a future where the President of Cheleme would transform and she would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas would be a welcome sort of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deeper and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump takes a war against informants from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to get rid of the rigid circuits he should fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that "things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the gallery, Manning called for her oversized signature (the "i" in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, based on gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is her mitochondrial DNA sequence - an all-rounder of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in the biological sense, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novella.</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how she appears with a free-spreader in her hand from the United States's disciplinary powers such as King Kong.</seg>

<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulacres, which are gathered like hordes of protesters.</seg>

<seg id="2203">Start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber</seg>
<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start-up, but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Answers were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - deceitful.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there has never been consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Association Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software, which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, offer specialist groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint-hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-suite managers and to turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the Snap surveys and polls from certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so that you can re-drill why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they have to stay at the top of the workplace culture, so that you won't be the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been penalised.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as Glint, this wish is a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The global governance, regulation and compliance industry could have more than $118.7 billion by 2020, following the latest Let's Talk Payments website.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, Start-up Convercent, who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the middle of the amber stand in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Scent has almost 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">A client recently signed up as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">As Glint, Convercent enables companies to send customized "pulse" surveys, collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And if the chief executive board is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"the court of public opinion has grasped regulators," said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent.</seg>
<seg id="2224">If a company is found that does not treat its employees badly or behave ruethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and lawsuits, "said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a timidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel who said there was no good way to track the complaints from employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that were previously hidden by managers living in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unfair interns - can be identified quicker and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience of employment," "" "said Vitrano, who heads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take Ethics, Values and Employees Commitment in 2002 after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies recognised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both Glint and Convercent offer their software as a service and debit the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">It is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups.</seg>
<seg id="2236">In February Convercent received $10 million in financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glitter secured $10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and raised its entire funding to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising given the interconnected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing research complex that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only applications.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"" "" "" "when people are happy to be in a company that's worth their voices, and that the work you do is worthwhile, then they feel more committed to making this company successful," "" "said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn who used both the ConverFlyer and Glint." ""</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies are working well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement in the workplace culture experts is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data is useless if the caretakers of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it can have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, it can raise frustration and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for more than 4,000 ideas, you must be ready to have 4,000 conversations," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data.</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you don't follow, employees will ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and if you don't care, why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now conducts monthly employee surveys, was able to initiate actions on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint, so Errett.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, it was the speed of decision making and the quality of communication, capable of reorganizing several teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">With Ruby Tuesday, the company always receives new insights into employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better attachment of employees in a branch that is known for high sales.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"" "" "" "if you are not obligated to create a culture of transparency, you will lose people," "" "said Vitrano." ""</seg>
<seg id="2257">"and if you lose people, you also lose customers.</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970's and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has lived 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Mainl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mopolitan Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says with pride." ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'A Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ragiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I just reacted to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he were also there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome grudge") all this seems too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with counties, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" "" "whiskey and began to write." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust received full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just started to look after the archive, which he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats" said, "Oh, throw it on the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that represent what possessed: "you might think that country conflicts would be boring," says Rhodes, "but there was a birch that fought two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">Guys, let's go all the way! "</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a recording of a turmoil that occured in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes.</seg>

<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like The Priest, which tells the history of the Jesuit paternity that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell was portrayed in the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the gentlemen appeared to be Gauner, always making loans and spending money on things they couldn't afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crisis by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to promote landlady. "</seg>
<seg id="2318">Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experiences after the end of his deployment in the castle</seg>

<seg id="2338">Each year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on boarding and carriage in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">This week also.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff, as before, but in the presidency of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Defence, Inner, Justice and Foreign Ministers took part in the deliberations.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Thus the civilians in the YAS were in the number.</seg>
<seg id="2345">The government reins the reins in the military.</seg>
<seg id="2346">The Chief of Staff Hulusi Akar remains in office, but the officers of the army, the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed.</seg>
<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as a wirehead of the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2349">Against 486 persons who allegedly participated in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara since this week.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had described the coup attempt as a "gift of God," as he gave him the opportunity to "completely clean up the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But has Erdogan really grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper "Hürriyet" published an article entitled "Discomfort in the military headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">There are concerns in the general staff for an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headcase ban for female soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The great deal with the army and the security forces goes on.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan was sent by decree to fire another 7395 state servants, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan was taming the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be old masters of the country earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they appealed to their role as guardians of the worldly state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Following his election victory in 2002, Erdogan thronged the power of the military step by step, not least with reference to the European Union's reform plans.</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say that Erdogan drives a targeted Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't get crazier in 2017, a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin taking her ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people are making fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it and we will see them much more often," said Mr. Sharkey at the release of his new report.</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">The user can "adjust" his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or the colour of his fingernails.</seg>
<seg id="2398">"" "but it becomes even more disturbing since many robots have the" "" "personalities" "" "who would make a Stepet woman look progressive." ""</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion, featuring pre-programmed personages such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can be" "" "in mood" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subservient female properties, the allusions to rape, when one goes one step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah, trouble one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website compared True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it means on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing finesse point to something dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men, of course, don't have sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their increasing popularity, they remain at the edge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what escapes from the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of the time we live in.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly evolved sex robots appear at a time in which women's rights are threatened all over the world, in which there is a president in the White House who has braced women sexually assaulted.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') are not the graphic images, the winding physique and the ejected eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical resemblance to actual women as realistically as technically possible (if also with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply walk away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no intermediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the fantasy of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are pleasing slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the idiom of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a truer of the Trump Era that the political divisions that polarized US voters have also split families in small format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving Day there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all ostensibly trying to burst out our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring families together.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a leaning poet, who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House, everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and completely strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The dining table is certainly a good thing, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the issuing effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"" "when we talk about" "" "normalization" "" "and" "" "Trump" "", "we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his kitten will no longer be repelled." ""</seg>
<seg id="2436">"" "however, there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans the right wing" "" "normalises" "", "which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urcomical version of the mad - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to Trump in fact seem to be a very mild criminal offence.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump is concerned, the next candidate of the Republicans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park, the largest of the carousels of the New York Parks Department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need any caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormous, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are growling and the animals turn to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the perpendicular music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city does not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed no Swiss Cottage - the Topic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage doesn't count - but a big roundabout in the north of London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">However, the Central Park carousel is still a strange magic experience since two years old, a 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have been able to judge the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but luckily no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, during this week in a department store, I was forced to rate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to pay the rating with a 15% tip - this to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where none is required.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was disappointing, while I was tired of the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars.</seg>

<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprising that no application has so far fulfilled the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible date.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study claims just the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the person concerned is normally advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immune cells patrol in the intestines to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging delicate tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the equilibrium tends to go too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments, it was found that a type of tolerance provokes an immune cell in mice carrying a particular bacterium in their intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>

<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet tolerant of tryptophan will promote more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus if the same system works with people.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that favours tolerance when it found that a group of mice had such cells, but a different group of the same trunk, which was however divided, had not had that.</seg>
<seg id="2593">It assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbes of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria present in the mice with the immune cells but lacking in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">To understand how the bacteria spread to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers duplicate the amount of tryptophan in the feed of the mice, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan properties were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether Tryptophan's by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">"" "she said," "" "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine." ""</seg>

<seg id="2673">In addition, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg City Development informed in sensations on Wednesday.</seg>

<seg id="2675">Since 1991 it has been in sensation redevelopment areas.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, previous renovations are a "success project" - it is important to promote internal development and not only to develop new construction areas.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, I received information from the government presidency of Karlsruhe that there will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The sum of the funds amounts to 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 euro came from the country, the rest of the community felt.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the Bund Project" "" "Social Town" "", "where the restructurings would then be carried out." ""</seg>

<seg id="2692">In November or December, the statute is to be carried out as soon as possible, so that the renovation can begin in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Subsequently, Pietzschmann explained that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned investigations.</seg>

<seg id="2716">The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Navy One, when the president is on board was the centerpiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>
<seg id="2717">President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states.</seg>
<seg id="2718">The helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited beside a Maine Yacht, a Wisconsin fire brigade and a Mississippi forklift.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House military bureau required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the helicopter Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for operation of the helicopter.</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superior, the deputy commander of the naval aviation.</seg>
<seg id="2721">The message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o'clock in the morning at 7 o'clock in the morning for the event at 3 o'clock and so long remained until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening.</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the restriction of the service hours a second team would be needed for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original air crew was at the helicopter during the event, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the floor during the time on the plane.</seg>
<seg id="2724">From the records provided by TIME, it was not clear whether a second air crew was ultimately required.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.</seg>

<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in putting the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">HMX-1 does not have budgetary plans for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact costs for the event.</seg>
<seg id="2744">According to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, however, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $24.380 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of the unit recorded the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argued that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "" "" "the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "" "said Walters." ""</seg>

<seg id="2749">According to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract.</seg>

<seg id="2865">Paris Saint-Germain will not abandon Neymar's pursuit after having issued an offer of £189 million to release its release clause, but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record case?</seg>
<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has made the transfer window heated in the summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United over the past season for 89 million pounds.</seg>
<seg id="2867">After finishing, Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world. PSG offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week.</seg>

<seg id="2869">But was the World Cup warned against this prospect three years ago by the PSG President?</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse attacks relieves Pope-brother George Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann means.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement, "We are the Church," declared by the former Regensburger bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the embodiment of Pope Benedict XVI, an apology.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their false appraisal of the events.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican daily" "" "Osservatore Romano" "" "on the other hand criticised the fact that reporting on violence in the Domspatzen is measured with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">In regard to the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; but the "degree of media manipulation," says the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," writes Scaraffia.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "people like to go to the church and that's a fresher." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that" "" "blows are a normal educational tool" "" "in their youth," "" "to deal with naughty children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">They find it unfair to apply today's standards to previous decades, because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with reports on abuse of abuse, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "totally wrongly, author and historian Michael Hesemann means" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann: "for all this had nothing to do with him," he adds the results of the final report.</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber by the diocese of Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen (Domspatzen) took place between 1945 and the early 1990s, "with high plausibility" Victims of attack, 67 Domspatzen, sexually abused.</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to be Georg Ratzinger, who had been working in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary it can be said that by R. Domenellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotional appeal the punishment for the students could also be more violent.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims of general humanity were valued by R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories are linked to him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440 page report on the" "" "incidents of non-violence against protection ordered at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">On the one hand, many students emphasize his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, he also appears as cholercian and perfectionist, who became more palpable when a domain atz brought no top performance musically.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read all the 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated only once eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the horrific cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses at the pre-school also took place outside of his sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can at best reproach him, know it too late or have not taken the first hints seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"" "the grammar school gymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived as" "" "redemption," "" "" "" "heaven" "" "and" "" "better world" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">Thus also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger presents a very excellent testimony, describing him as "warm-hearted," "sincere," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as an extremely good-natured teacher who regularly nourished the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and "always surrounded by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to rage outbreaks.</seg>
<seg id="2920">That he did not only crush with chairs and cast the key ring on the ground, but also distributed ear-cowards and pulled too freaky guys on the hair or ears, he himself already admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">For his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each of us was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I also experienced that in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In comparison to what is actually happening in this report, the horrible sexual abuse and the violence of violence at the preschool, it is certainly Bagatelles.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it has to do with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just crashed onto him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, a lot was reported in connection with the report on the topic misuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger being charged with regard to sexual abuse in the final report also in regard to sexual abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to be entrusted to the master's master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were initiated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "" "said one affected representative for the others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was, however, that most victims of shame are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen senior students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of the abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student thus formulated it: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) would have had timely realizations and could have been able to stop the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I consider it... also for really absurd to assume that it is calculated... Buben are more intrusive, clearer, or more open than against their parents, dormitory leaders, trustworthy teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks about sex with him... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "that the students and / or their environment affected him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free from all co-members.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Thus it cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to the display.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore there is no reason to associate his good name with these vile crimes, as it happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">"" "in the media, there was a lot of" "" "nonviolence" "" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen." ""</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former master master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "gazing out" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything was mixed and mixed in the coverage of a huge melange of sexual abuse and nonviolence and somewhere in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">There is a clean separation: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, we say once, other allegations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">The report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choir director of the Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly channelled and maladjusted and suffered terribly, all at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have prevailed.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But the master master Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them, because he only got the boys face when they were already on the gymnasium gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">"" "on that, as most of the witnesses stress, the subject" "" "preschool" "" "taboo." ""</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was indeed discipline, but there was no sadistic violence.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims underestimated the general humanity of R." "", "and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories link with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">In this way, at most, the accusation remains to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschool.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself, and from his predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) wanted to hear nothing, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">In front of the states, Georg Ratzinger resolutely closed the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the gymnasium gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that in the preschool, he continues to practice the punishment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">In view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended immediate intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">This was, of course, at a time when legal clarity existed as testing fines in Bavaria long ago banned.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each one of us knows still.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected persons might be exaggerated or dramatized and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one cannot say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That simply doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "" "snare of anachronism" "", "i.e. the danger to evaluate the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess was right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abominable at all times and also not for what was breached in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">It's all terrible and I'm glad that it's finally being worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I must take care of Georg Ratzinger because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, such as slap and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then forbidden, he also strictly adhered to it.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his rainy season has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in our conversations with you for the book" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject test drive also speak to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells from his perspective, the Domspatzen played only a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I did not by no means conceal that there was a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even that must be said once: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditioned discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trance from the rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candy alone, a rebellious boy will not once again be a great singer and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person did you see as Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, basic benign, deeply believer and heartfelt people, from whom you can't imagine that he could do just a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his expulsion, regularly contact him, visit him, read him, he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who have not forgiven him to this day, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the cathedral-cats are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and has familiarized them with the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still see and worship them today.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, once again clearly: all you submit to him are educational methods which were on the order of the day at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long ago overcome this.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is highly unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">There is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report that has just been published relieves him.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the anarchist, a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany, probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
