28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the stair@@ well of a local grocery store .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went up again with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se , found on Wednesday morning in West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the Department of Appe@@ al in San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department told that death was classified as murder and the investigations were underway .
the victim &apos;s brother , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS Sender K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a chef at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will sadly miss him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank initially lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the things for him finally went uphill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; combining his way with his family was to always cook something , prepare us for dinner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of discussion .
he was the brother , who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond that sh@@ one brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has any information will be asked to call the tel@@ eph@@ on of the S@@ F@@ PD under the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston hasn &apos;t always had to be perfect or successful .
the Hollywood star has made this unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always plug@@ ged into drawers or getting stuck from outside labels that have little to do with me and reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not have the desire to be always perfect and successful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be honest , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh at the fact that she is considered Miss Perfect as she explains in the current Cos@@ mop@@ olitan .
the act@@ ress most likes to spend her time at home , in front of a television with a lo@@ cker@@ em and Mexican food , it &apos;s called in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she brings the question to the white blood : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they ch@@ ased home to the feeding trou@@ ghs in a quick gal@@ lo@@ p .
one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger .
and thus ended the riding career again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses .
he let his family run over the AL@@ RV and on a horse he didn &apos;t even bo@@ ther for photo purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport @-@ aid handed over the Golden sport pyramid to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala .
the sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete does not lack awards .
German Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , silver bay leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already beg@@ ged him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen , on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for decades , Lan@@ ger has been supporting young generation .
and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros right away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US master winner was included in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the athletes are athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the gymn@@ asts Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ ball Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the show stadium , where the Lav@@ azza Prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invest in infrastructure and prevent T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the two U.S. pres@@ idents do not agree on tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is based on a fundamentally philosophical difference .
on the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate it to death , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump .
he will go back to regulations mas@@ sively , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and for businesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities to open and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why taxes would be increased for the rich , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure .
in the future , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost iden@@ tically .
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the rule of the state @-@ critical party wing of the Republi@@ cans .
thus , non @-@ party discussions might come to tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the differences in energy and climate policies are more clear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA .
oil production is also to be possible in previously protected areas , the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it .
Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand the renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want we to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , both do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply to better protect American jobs .
they should be paid even better , says Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
he wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour .
what tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
on the one hand is Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth .
his critics charge him that the budget deficit would only be greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least from the rich , is that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every escaped woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing alone .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby , which is at the most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until one talks to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is an area managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor of social welfare services in Bavaria , and among other things she deals with the topic women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are refugees .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few decentr@@ alised accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs has set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - neither as visitors .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s not exagger@@ ating to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences with sexual violence on her escape , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men are fle@@ eing for wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten to torture or death , or because their families &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; send them to Europe as Hope &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly from seeing no other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor killing , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
that drives them away .
on the escape this goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
those who believe that the end , as soon as they come to Germany , are mistaken , says B@@ ahr .
here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and badly ab@@ used .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the North @-@ speaking part of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; some of the children were certainly not voluntarily . &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what they experienced , because shame is too big . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , they need more accommodation just for them , asks B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven District Govern@@ ments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no .
in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the accommodation of the governments .
in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone fle@@ eing women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia , in some common shel@@ ters or own houses there are only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament is also calling for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are hosted separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the privacy is missing or if men and women are accommod@@ ated together , it can lead to - perpet@@ ual violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much the women feel this need for protection can be read by the urge that there is on the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
assistance doctors strike : demands for new working campaigns
assistant physicians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new labour campaign measures in their dispute regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract .
in July , assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
in a letter to the members who were released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; would have had problems , which led to the rejection of the treaty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new contract and request official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ations for all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal petition to a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council in order to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating working campaigns that began at the beginning of September .
the disputes led to assistance doctors quar@@ rel@@ ing six times this year , the first complete out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistance doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ chi@@ ana res@@ ig@@ ned after the election to decline the agreed contractual conditions which had been recommended by the B@@ MA .
he shared B@@ MA members during the sessions which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians and medical students , with the fact that the contract was advantageous and should be accepted .
after the vote , Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia and Turkey : an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot deny that Ankara would most want this reconciliation .
there was a hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s s@@ miles seemed too timi@@ d , and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
to me his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introduc@@ tions : the launching of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was angry .
Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend .
re@@ building the ve@@ to becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
most serious were the accus@@ ations made by senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan to listen to .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious .
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after having been removed from his office last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular bann@@ ing charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed .
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean .
this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious at the West as it considers its response to the attempted tak@@ eover of power as a weak response .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara to claim support for the elected state authorities in Ankara following the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow which itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ it@@ tering palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to me as an analy@@ st : two countries which viol@@ ate the West and feel bad and now unite .
nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the greatest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played its role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents were said at the press conference that they hadn &apos;t even stri@@ pped the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise it .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tili@@ ties - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey poured out the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside of Scotland no longer available
according to the Bank &apos;s Executive Board , the R@@ BS brand is to be reduced to a back @-@ office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
the bank has since dis@@ soci@@ ated itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other end consumer brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised head office and the stock exchange listing are to be changed to Nat@@ West .
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private customer business that are more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan has been inter@@ viewed by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire during a sightseeing tour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes our investment brand and the brand among which our employees will be busy , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
I now say that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives .
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of brands , because how do we focus within ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and have launched these brands .
but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th profit at Pre@@ dil@@ ection at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne to a double at New@@ market , which brings 3.@@ 000@@ th profits
on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3.@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market .
he placed a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , which is trained by John Gos@@ den on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won against G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I ended up here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ er when he cat@@ ches his victory on Pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career nights
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern@@ ity and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone , which only few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charism@@ a thri@@ lled fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie several weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already collected 6,000 winn@@ ings , if he were not only a weekend and grand tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden the winners in the UK for almost 30 years , which is great .
he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat@@ race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived an airplane crash and received a ban on drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six month lock , but he showed an impressive character to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not yet in the end - D@@ ett@@ ori said earlier that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 5 years old .
Russian President hum@@ idi@@ fies Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov un@@ expect@@ edly .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the closest trust of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed the Special Repres@@ entative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin ordered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been Deputy Director since 2012 , was appointed to succeed him .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Estonian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as Head of State on bills and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do you see the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of the closest confi@@ dant Vladimir Putin for a long time and worked as he worked for the Soviet sec@@ rec@@ y , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , aired on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ ig@@ ned on his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at the moment .
but the official statement - that a man who was once tou@@ ted as a potential president once would lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin cited on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said it is true that I asked you to talk to me in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - entru@@ sting these difficult items for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy .
when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people , whom he most trusted .
it was once believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution .
but this post was taken by another closest ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son took part in a physical confrontation with the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced his dis@@ miss@@ al in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al on Thursday .
on the set there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details on how the Gib@@ son character of the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the opinion of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , participated in the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my whole heart blood in the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday .
I had hoped to be there until the end , but that will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans who can only wish for a series .
the scheduled au@@ ra of the twel@@ fth season will be scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish landing in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a citizen of Ban@@ ff called for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain believes that the 75 species of fish could deal with Sand@@ a@@ ale that have been sow@@ ed by a fountain .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ land Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the project &apos;s £ 1,@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ a@@ duct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mercy @-@ b@@ lower &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 incline ropes .
the project , which is a £ 1.@@ 35 billion , is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ a@@ duct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit .
in total , nearly 79 % of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck is today in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge .
Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing , Construc@@ tors , said : &quot; the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project .
this fantastic project represents the closure of tr@@ end@@ setting civil engineering and civil engineering .
after installing the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower on the North Tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive , because the vi@@ a@@ duct is 2@@ 22 metres long , about 6,000 tons and had to be moved upwards at an ascent of about 3 % .
delicate as the tolerances to which the team was working were tiny - on each side they only em@@ bed a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
&quot; &quot; &quot; rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown off fishing boats in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event at Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming while their boat moved on their own power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and made us feel the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted in the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the boat engine had an emergency stop , it was released by the person who controlled the boat .
someone has w@@ aged over these men today .
seriously injured - man sticks to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police shared yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old shared the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings .

she then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ husband .

who builds cheap apartments from Braunschweig ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens are saying : investors should be taken seriously more strongly in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that in the next few years Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Concept of Action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the next session . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost , the question is : who should build the cheap apartments ?
so far , a provision is lacking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Group President Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : anyone who wants to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all homes as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the favorable apartments , however , can also arise in the continu@@ ance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big dispute in the town hall is , according to Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how to deal with investors who want to build on private grounds ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors on these areas to build at least 10 percent , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new municipal housing development programme , which will cost millions of dollars and still needs to be financed , should provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make as few rules as possible to investors .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
despite this , according to Brat@@ mann , a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market is underway .
if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management .
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
but the program is still not entirely : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how do you compensate for the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments whose funding will run out over the next few years ?
only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , according to plan @-@ policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , current bin@@ dings should now be purchased from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to return apartments back to price binding .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke , the problem could be solved .
for the end of the year , dead@@ lines run out in the western city .
around 1800 apartments one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments .
only : they do not want the owners , the apartment building companies .
because the number of social dwell@@ ings in the Western city is dras@@ tically increased again , they are removed from the aim of the so @-@ called mix .
there should be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; group leader Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U must go into the boat for a broad majority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
although I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that it is not yet possible to find a compromise .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that &apos;s worth it
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
that teenagers and children don &apos;t go outside to play anymore , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people away from the sofa and becoming more active .
the time at the screen was initially limited to the TV , then to video games and recently limited to smartphones .
it is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
it goes without saying that I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later a carto@@ on series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created from it ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , interest has fallen before the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and , once found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( using a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; captured &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the ma@@ dness and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the U.S. , the game led to a considerable increase in steps the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 35@@ ,000 users , announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of subsequent people who exercise every day 30 minutes , j@@ umped from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company does not know who is going to play Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just looks the raw data for the increase in performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get away from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; go every day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; met de@@ af ears , because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look mis@@ erable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ valued .
anyone who regularly sports sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to attract them here .
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even include new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as usual , there are also mu@@ er@@ ous gam@@ bl@@ ers who have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what is it supposed to do ?
a breakthrough happened .
even if Smartphone Apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does .
the new will lose its charm and the use will decrease over time .
due to Pok@@ emon &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with activ@@ ism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
do not forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
brilliant all the way .
and now finally also the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ki@@ cked off on Thursday for a multi @-@ fight title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the Americans Sim@@ one Bil@@ es performs on the balance beam during the single campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics event at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who wins a multi @-@ battle title and overall the fifth while holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end .
this achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years her sport , 15 world championship med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
she was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a competition that was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be considered a dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ stage women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday while at the f@@ arewell celebration of the retired man coordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ es insist@@ ed , during their long journeys to the top , never have planned the future , this is not really true .
some of her floor exercises - which contain her typical tum@@ bling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coinci@@ dence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a competition , a series of victories that will last as long as Bil@@ es desires .
even though Must@@ af@@ ina easily led through two turns , the picture clou@@ ded .
Swedish bar and floor gymn@@ as@@ tics - in which Bil@@ es holds the World Championship title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she got up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the deck of Swe@@ des - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor there was another one .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her grand@@ child - a pure form@@ ality - and tears poured on fine shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old male captains called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had a lead . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after her floor exercise she threw the audience into kis@@ ses , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning from the beginning of this week :
police : 3 victims in mass mur@@ der@@ ous applause when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were killed , who died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a single drive , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a manual gun while he stood on the passenger side of the car and subsequently fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police informed that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder did not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 owned by one of the adult victims .
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
in total , seven persons were killed in nine attacks and two more were injured in His@@ panic neighbor@@ hoods within four months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; told Howard the K@@ HP@@ O , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to their injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which depen@@ ded on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ ic : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund Mikro@@ zep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that .
I can &apos;t do that .
I didn &apos;t let myself down on that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not true at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund may never see her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer to it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a help .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of age , and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth is showing the sign language that Ed@@ mund has de@@ vised for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we teach him sign language , &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS news explained .
but it &apos;s not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on her own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has many causes : genetic as in Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked all the time , what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .

heavy ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call out the emergency on Friday . it is expected all Saturday with more rainf@@ alls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi floo@@ ded their shores and threatened with widespread floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials were in constant contact with local authorities and were already on the way to the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emergency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had demanded tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 @-@ inch rain could fall in this area .
a flood warning system was deployed in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite River near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels after the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the subur@@ ban neighbor@@ hoods near Bat@@ on Rouge .
he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger as it will flow slowly through the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 .
rescue teams still shr@@ ank people from the floo@@ d@@ water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the southwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved close to Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , grew strongly overnight .
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we woke up and the water stre@@ amed and streaming in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years where she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all disabilities and he would be the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency @-@ sur@@ fers had res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and would have taken them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the flood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had rapidly spread , as there was still heavy rainf@@ all and that the authorities had to consider ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer sign@@ alled by 13.@@ 75 inches in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the ground by rainf@@ all has been much more complete since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy ra@@ ins and floo@@ ding flood the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching failure in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches that were floo@@ ded both now .
the leader of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets that were washed up by floods .
in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to house the ev@@ acu@@ ees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the Municip@@ ality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last great flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his information , a handful of houses on Thursday have been reported as floo@@ ded , but on Friday no reported .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; I &apos;ve seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extingu@@ ished by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police announces that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
the grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries including in the end , leg , arm , and abdom@@ en , but that he was in hospital at his transport to the hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his little body was full of bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother Dol@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
Brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was shot at the front seat of a car with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who finds himself in a critical condition , reported the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating if one of the injured men could be the perpet@@ rators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that there was apparently a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
pat@@ rons for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , were over@@ crow@@ ding the scene of the crime .
it seems that this was clearly a continual struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , there were shells .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there seems to have been several armed fighters who were involved very actively , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the sender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
there was no arrest , and the police are re@@ viewing the surveillance video at present .
on Tuesday another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross trainer on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s Olympics in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that for more than one reason .
first , I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ esses , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is a Catholic , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an Af@@ ro @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
that shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympic ath@@ lete and America che@@ ered .
now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three World Championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , how they provided unexpected but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ ize routines .
on Thursday Sim@@ one was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ os@@ exual American woman who won gold at an individual multi @-@ event event .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this type of sport , but as a result , gymn@@ as@@ tics all over the country do not look like this .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four gymn@@ asts in the team . it is also the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sports and gymn@@ asts come primarily in private gymn@@ as@@ tics , which are maintained by parents , who pay for the training , setup , travel , competitive and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) .
the majority of these gymn@@ as@@ tics lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both trained their athletes since they started their gymn@@ as@@ tics .
we have to au@@ n the congregations around inn@@ um@@ erable young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easily accessible gym exercise .
I founded my 20 @-@ year foundation .
in my events we have offered free and affordable gymn@@ as@@ tics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers ( mainly black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport .
gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health and for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that encourages thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thanks Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance physicians would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed agreement with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assistance physicians agreed to vote rejected him .
in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans were un@@ veiled to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS was in a &quot; no man country &quot; and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients .
the first residen@@ ces are to receive a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend examinations to improve the care at un@@ scheduled times .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the B@@ MA Committee for Assistance Do@@ ors announced last night in a message : &quot; assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed deal , in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and treat it to meet all physicians . &quot;
in only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and the time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes through talks have met with the government on reluc@@ tance and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
this happened after a promise made by Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the constra@@ int and address the concerns of the resident doctors . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are willing to carry out further work campaigns .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike post .
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to spend a better week &apos;s remuneration for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of the N@@ HS Emplo@@ ye@@ es , called upon the assistance doctors to termin@@ ate the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour campaign measures do not reach little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and are only concerned with care , need and interruption for the patients , nursing staff and their families . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last two months we have spoken to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries .
the employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who returned from a professional exp@@ ul@@ sion , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious they were the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the B@@ MA in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day medication that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ating medication T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or another heart attack .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four year long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four year long intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
some 14@@ 0,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , which form coverings .
when the t@@ opping breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ utter causing the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack .
when the blood c@@ lot dis@@ solves , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and block the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke .
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and distributed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness leaves electoral fraud in Muslim areas flour@@ ishing
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed from office last year due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities , ignor@@ ing a devastating government report today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally interfer@@ es with police , election ob@@ servers and town coun@@ cils to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former minister of integration and municipal government , who is now a antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of elec@@ tors from religious reasons would be so bad that it should be permitted by the police to set off shut @-@ off belts outside of elec@@ tive cabins in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters .
he recommends that voters should lead an identification card in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er only has to name his name and address .
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they em@@ it their vote to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal materials and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud but also to protect the local government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that comes with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign in the east of London .
last year , a special tri@@ bunal decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was to be removed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would silence his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic accus@@ ations .
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person el@@ ects someone else .
Sir Eric said that there is evidence of fraud throughout the country .
in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm to the frau@@ dul@@ ent election of letters - that the older members of the Muslim community would have put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guidance of evidence to prove identity
in his report , it says : &quot; as evidence was attached that pressure was exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , especially Communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi backgrounds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour because of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intoler@@ ances regarding eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric proposed 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists edit letters to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poll@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report , considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral directory being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has left her voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are eligible for election .
a three year limit on applications for automatic mail selection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prohibition that political activists work on full postal and envel@@ opes of mail elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have authority to set up barri@@ ca@@ des for election stations .
a law amend@@ ment , which facilit@@ ated an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Sub@@ stitute Act 1983 ) .
ban on photography in election stations .
request that only English may be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees generally en@@ force that voters go alone to the election cabin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was filed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the electoral tri@@ bunal has declared that Rah@@ man and his deputy are un@@ fit for illegal practices because of a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty on the basis of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ ups &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the electoral departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
crazy to K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has turned out to be an impressive Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ ad is by far not the only Ath@@ lete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces gle@@ aming at the time on our screens , F@@ email created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the h@@ unter and the wolf : team member of the US squ@@ ad in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , is compared since childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
besides K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the Internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the US squ@@ ad in the arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks incredibly similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I myself do not see any great simil@@ arity , except for facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I probably take it as a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular Ac@@ tor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big , expressive eyes will be able to go through as a Doppel@@ gän@@ ger for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one gear higher : this user believes that Nathan is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another persistent comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ wig , who has similarly severe ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal floating in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ fi@@ mo@@ va shows more than just sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : football star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory in space : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ unen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , which resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .

the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; died &quot; like &quot; low &quot; and died during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought his microphone had been turned off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ style swimming @-@ monkey .
Mac@@ Donald who had been brought back to the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; he could say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went down like a pig , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming st@@ aff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadian people to close the gap to China .
viewers in all Canada responded quickly online after being shock@@ ed by sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died like a pig &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on stream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in lost the connection , baby . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came fast and hard , many of which made him talk .
Twitter users did not stay back when they heard how in@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; shortly after Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast , ap@@ olog@@ ised live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast about a swimming pool . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ happy chosen formulation , sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times at the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users compl@@ aining about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last night , we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on air and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . By@@ ron is very sorry for what he said .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the program and tried to justify his re@@ mark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swim in the C@@ BC Olympics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not on them as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled out her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try out under@@ pants .
to ag@@ grav@@ ate the situation , she looked as she looked at it , pulled her out and put her back to the shelf .
she continued browsing and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping centre in Folk@@ stone .
the primary business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ stone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put them back into the shelf .
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ garments , she went back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put them back into the shelf . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything , got up and went out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to be bo@@ thered by anyone watching - or thinking about the person who under certain circumstances would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how disgu@@ sting to think that someone would take under@@ pants with home another person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to withdraw the garments from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and they were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that occurred in our branch in Folk@@ stone on Tuesday , August 9th . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make him a bit more secure for you .
we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a club in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at a close distance .
regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to flip the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when you approach you from behind you should turn around as first , so you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; move out of the line &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Miz@@ ra@@ chi says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
strike it with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er cro@@ oked against pain , the weapon out of his hands . strike it with the barrel and move backwards while holding the weapon on it .
with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and hit the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon on it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how Miz@@ ra@@ chi performs .
but remember that if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master , it is the most secure thing to do with a rob@@ ber@@ y .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
a British trav@@ eller subjected his immune system to a serious test by le@@ aking up some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
the pres@@ enter and ch@@ auff@@ eur Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k switched his train on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a pull knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before dra@@ gging each object , he used a lumin@@ ance meter to show himself what he is going to get .
but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight .
the idea of replacing the pur@@ ge of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact , there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health .
luckily , nothing left behind what he li@@ cked up , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right became known for testing the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
from public ban@@ ist@@ ers to railway stations to flush bones of toilets , the task established its immune system definitely under a rehear@@ sal
in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his trial line showed a lumin@@ ance of more than 4000 units .
compared to this , the lumin@@ ous intensity of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after their lumin@@ ance amounted to over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I &apos;m not going to check here because it is disgu@@ sting in@@ doors .
the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company provides Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and the immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; validation Senior Research President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health will become a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others where this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o from 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents associated lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
A@@ Social family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ um social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social housing after a del@@ o@@ tion with a loss of £ 50,000 because they had terrori@@ zed their neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ done and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ port@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after being forci@@ bly removed from the property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls had perfor@@ ated holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn open , tr@@ ash was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house@@ keeper at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider , since this property is believed to be not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is likewise .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ ding and cur@@ bing .
Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old tr@@ ash was found
the estate in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past were torn open to wood floors
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner viol@@ ently on the property this week after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the dol@@ phins were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep tonight . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now that they are finally gone , it will be beautiful .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood Enfor@@ cement manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have arranged the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police was called at regular intervals for 20 years
on the over@@ grown site of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
he added : &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , since del@@ o@@ gation is always the last step taken into consideration by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing .
this was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horri@@ ble for their neighbors .
I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police and members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information we have provided .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behavior will not be tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ ding on the floor
workers of the property management will now have to remove garbage mountains that surround the house
in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ don received a fine after ow@@ ning the owner of a class B drug in trade @-@ intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ by , who died in 2013 at a car accident .
after they were without shelter , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many room walls of the house were covered with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they are navig@@ ating r@@ enter who do not stick to the house rules
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall told Angela C@@ row that the deletion was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ reproach and to those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists in Portugal moved to panic after a ti@@ eff@@ lor@@ ding military jet flies to the beach
sun@@ bath@@ ers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal witnessed the shock of their lives
a portu@@ guese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force used an incredible crash landing
the Air Force admitted that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no safety risk present
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start pan@@ i@@ cking after a pep@@ per@@ y jet crashed on a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers rus@@ hed up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the D@@ üs@@ s , without first seeing what came through the clouds to them .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers posting videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just browsing and it felt like the plane would drop me down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach at Av@@ eiro are panic @-@ driven when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
the Portuguese air@@ strikes today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fis@@ her boats off the coast and fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the spokes@@ man said that because of the bad visibility , the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to the bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires have destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death .
the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke - which limits his view .
the plane was on a training flight , where the pilot had to identify as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is the first step for the first win in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super Cup against FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ W@@ inners will have to do without the subordin@@ ate Cup@@ fin@@ alists and the reig@@ ning European League Champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who will contest the Olympic football tournament in Brazil .
also Goethe &apos;s Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the course of the training , and at least for now Bar@@ ca &apos;s demand was clari@@ fied in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the rest of the cont@@ est@@ ants pres@@ enters .
before the first mandatory game of the new season there is doubt about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. really did not really know how to persu@@ ade them at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ ce@@ al@@ opp on S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sev@@ ille again di@@ gest@@ ed the 2 : 3 defeat after length@@ ening in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with so far , Barcelona has eleven successes of the record winner in this competition .
Ma Long in a separate league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis tournament winner .
on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow coun@@ try@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5.4 4 ) .
thus the World Ran@@ king first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and Olympi@@ as .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ fut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row Chinese would bring the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
the last non @-@ Chinese on the top@@ most Olympia @-@ podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches .
they had withdrawn on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve played the matches until now for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; Z@@ hang had said in a fold .
after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists were awarded with the China flag .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first movement .
after that he determined the tempo on the record and left Z@@ hang on a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the anticipated exciting match .
but nevertheless sufficient stunning ball changes were to be seen .
Mi@@ fut@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the white @-@ rus@@ hing had a rib@@ bed injury in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , after it was in medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to be content with sheet metal .
the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) had become Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte similarly high table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; enormous problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns even in traditional conservative states .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now uncovered weaknesses of his electoral campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire expressed as something as concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported .
having thrown 16 ri@@ vals out of the race in his own Republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are now growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump from Evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ cans .
according to a surv@@ ey@@ or surv@@ ey@@ ed from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor left the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , equ@@ alled .
other institutes see Tr@@ ump in the front , but not by the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state .
Arizona and Georgia are considered to be endangered .
in an interview with the station CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; either successful or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes nothing different than telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him at the end of political correctness , it was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports Tr@@ ump is said to have threatened to eliminate money to support his electoral campaign , he should not be able to present a better survey .
instead of this , the Republi@@ cans of the Republi@@ cans were more strongly attacked by the Congress .
Olympia : three che@@ ating with dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee .
Kenya &apos;s athletes thre@@ aten after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympics .
after a sc@@ ru@@ pul@@ ous attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer to his home .
the International Olympic Committee decided to immediately establish a disciplinary committee to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had informed that the former Spr@@ inter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had handed a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch in the Olympic village .
this has been reported to the leadership of Kenya by dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations , an IA@@ AF vo@@ ic@@ eover announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will carry out an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , handed down the sample and signed , &quot; stated K@@ eni@@ as Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation leader Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch had been dra@@ fted off the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested at his return at Nairobi airport .
in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , Kenya has been under special observation for some time now .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls imposed by the IO@@ C before the Rio games , unusual attention was made to the fact that athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympic Games begin .
as a result WA@@ DA Kenya accepted from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of the WA@@ DA .
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeated that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
in this sport , it has been proven that this type of sport has been covered in a systematic and systematic way .
Russia &apos;s athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
Salzburger &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
in the Shakespeare @-@ year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , like Romeo and Juli@@ et .
with this a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins championship . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled with the role of Mary a youth dream .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses .
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this production Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Maria plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then there would be Maria &apos;s personality .
she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with it .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
you can see it in each of its movements , in its looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly top@@ ical : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece is about prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the off@@ ert@@ ories went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them .
they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ sk@@ evi@@ e &apos;s lawyer said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group &apos;s bul@@ war@@ k , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday .
sul@@ tan was 17 years old and died after particulars of her family shortly after she had pre@@ tended to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as reminder and warning to others that these are the risks connected with it to go into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ evi@@ e .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school@@ girls from east London entered a plane in the direction of Turkey , followed by a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the democr@@ ats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court .
Republi@@ cans in the Senate have been blocking Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor to the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday , during a telephone conference , Rei@@ d said he would expect Clinton to select &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later told that he had not yet talked with Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not care for rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Ju@@ dge of the US App@@ ell@@ ation Court for the District of Columbia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; RAID said that Republi@@ cans have blocked the country &apos;s nom@@ ination , be lack@@ eys and heroes of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump is un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants to make nude calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Kal@@ endar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys is distinctive , because &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot;
I do that for women .
apparently it is the view that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we must return to the presentation of timeless and classic nude , where both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish the calendar .
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally to open Cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish population calcul@@ ates with mass flight
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Kurdish municipality of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Chairman of the Union Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following the attempted put@@ sch of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community of Germany expected a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with some hundred thousand protection @-@ seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday .
because the government had already moved bank@@ rupt stron@@ gh@@ olds for months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing inside Turkey .
after the worn put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state that takes refugees in their own country produces refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chief of the Union accused the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in alpine cities .
as a result , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the expression on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member , said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief of the Union demanded that the German government have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positioned itself as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Germany too , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; witch hunt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critic is taking place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel no longer safe in Germany for the first time in recent months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len practitioner eliminates the professional existence of teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics .
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t suit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , inci@@ dentally also the K@@ em@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks had already ordered the largest group of asylum @-@ seek@@ ers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup .
at the reporting date June 30 , this figure was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all referred to as asylum @-@ seek@@ ers ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey , there are no battles against war , poverty , or lack of perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; asylum rights pursuant to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t receive anything from the summer campaign - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
they understood it in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2021 the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because it &apos;s not stupid as until now : summer holidays , heat and rural elections - that is bit@@ ing .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners , are on holiday .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers traveling in the country , on Use@@ dom , Ru@@ egen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not locals , so you can &apos;t choose the country day .
in addition , there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers , posters hang up , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and count out voices in the end , only to rub magni@@ fic@@ ently .
until September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass election campaign short of the people over itself .
the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , head of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ist .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the land , spreading ro@@ ses and chat@@ ting a little with the people , just as it did his legendary elo@@ qu@@ ent predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff .
otherwise sea @-@ ering got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel sets the blame on the thri@@ ving of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the nice office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes election campaign at the right place .
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to make a major event ; the German Federal Chancellor Merkel is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree , it was more Nordrhein @-@ Westfalen , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise , the Nord@@ ost CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual electoral stands on market@@ places and in front of m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noted that in the country you are brus@@ hing off the basis that it has to be very strict , again to find a wire to the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the expan@@ se of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U election winner Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely , where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden marri@@ ages , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
because a lot is at stake , S@@ ella called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
at the election of 2011 , the SPD had clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in poll@@ s , should make the leap into the country &apos;s day .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ emergency and move mostly on the Internet to their election campaign .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it calls the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from that , green campaig@@ ners go on search for local vocal ap@@ rons among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , just cur@@ v@@ ades with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful .
your impression : &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated , there is nothing to complain about .
for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 8@@ pm , there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have done everything pretty sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet petrol station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ structure .
there is no default .
the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything will be ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; praised is also the return of those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to the establishment of house entran@@ ces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the construction site was mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ tenburg is again , the traffic situation within the place has eased .
the citizens can now drive from the B 27 from the B 27 on both sides .
the traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were considerable problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the deputy head office manager Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refur@@ bish@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ er@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Sch@@ leich@@ wege sought and rather trusted their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ posting .
what led to the fact that some trucks are fran@@ ch@@ ising in residential areas .
since speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself aware of the situation on the spot .
two to three per minute have been inj@@ ected .
the fastest was on the road with 77 km per hour in the tempo @-@ 30 zone .
but since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but the fact that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to revenue out@@ breaks can be seen through everyone who asks .
however , some are more and less affected .
those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum decline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the car deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running search is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most heavily captured are the local bars along the road .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words .
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit him hard . &quot;
customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing .
we have to be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales losses are aimed at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road refur@@ bish@@ ment was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dropped by two years &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to leave half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government @-@ president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner whether there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant should benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now they must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where so much more generous is handled .
in all lam@@ entations , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
finally , the family @-@ run business has been here since 17@@ 15 , he refers to the long history .
it is possible to understand that other regul@@ ars visit less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance .
if you cannot approach , it is also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts that his pedi@@ gree is returning to the end of the restoration work .
despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ term history .
six months of construction work , that &apos;s already brutal .
in the name of the fight against terror , laws are constantly being tigh@@ tened .
after recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a D@@ ul@@ lity status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ ati@@ ner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t over@@ load anybody .
others , additional points would first be discussed within the parties .
and I am also bet@@ ting on it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , as the Minister of the Interior , he was placed on results and in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for@@ er@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère has let a little time pass before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
some are already known , proc@@ laim@@ s , ple@@ dged : that a new security agency should take care of the crack of encrypted communication is not new .
nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapon rights .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more CC@@ TV surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is also not surprising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second attempt for proposals not to be made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck out jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man dre@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything that has no chances in the coalition partner anyway .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas .
they have it partly in themselves : he plans fast @-@ action for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of men before deport@@ ation .
refugees who are targeted in the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for safety verification .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of divor@@ ce for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than previously - for example those who commit crimes or deliberately throw their papers out to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of it is political and legal .
some are still un@@ filled and open questions .
and with some points - in the im@@ balances of patient ones for example , the question arises : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
yes , says de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the issues of refugees and terror .
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
in addition , many people worried about safety in the face of the high number of refugees .
and things that people deeply concern themselves could not be clas@@ sed either in election campaigns .
the inner security has moved immen@@ sely into the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
for this reason , the Union and the SPD are becoming increasingly in position on the subject of internal security .
in the past days , the two parties went on high .
only a tent@@ ative dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the chiefs of directors also demand a bur@@ ka prohibition and a return from the dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also struggling here for tran@@ sig@@ ent sounds .
he doesn &apos;t hold anything from a departure from the double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
it is not sensible to re@@ make you new .
and in case of a bur@@ ka prohibition , he raised constitutional concerns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitutional on all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it has to show itself first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot in it , which could cause disputes .
but the SPD is also trying to promote internal security on the issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel takes a cau@@ tious approach and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still happy to get gli@@ mm@@ ed .
in spite of diesel prices , the delivery numbers are rising worldwide .
but it is not in all markets round .
in the recall action , vor@@ tices are about a term .
Volkswagen starts in the second half of the year as part of the deliveries .
thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s biggest car manufacturer still has a positive advantage over the course of the year .
but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand slow@@ ed above all in Western Europe , and thereby adver@@ sely affected overall sales , such as the company listed in the D@@ ax .
in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars in July .
in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , sales were 14 percent lower than in the previous year .
in the home market of Germany deliveries declined by almost a sixth .
Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s head of marketing Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann drew back the weaker figures from July , above all on two sales days , less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic conditions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have given a reluc@@ tance to buy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the withdrawal from the EU also explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust f@@ umes first escal@@ ated , there is also a decline in the price of a minus .
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the princip@@ ally affected home brand of the Lower Saxony is further gli@@ mm@@ ed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a drop out of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales CEO Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales division from January to July .
at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting in the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW confirms that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance .
the car manufacturer issued a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate after the conversion , but does not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reason be legal refin@@ ements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen meant its German customers now a guarantee of modified diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; VW has fully fulfilled the requirements of my inquiry commission and the KBA . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has adopted the guarantee that after the conversion , fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not deteri@@ or@@ ate and all relevant vehicle values remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen is using the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the broad term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers , for example , come to a workshop for half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this can lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal can lead to uncertainty about possible warranty regulations as it was said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands of rich savers in future criminal interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank CEO Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit or day money accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federation of German banks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay pen@@ alties for their savings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent of pen@@ alties .
this fee is required by the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank in September from private and corporate clients for deposits more than € 100,000 on sight deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future will cost 400 euros in the year , &quot; said Paul .
for some time , he kept 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not exploit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Bank Director . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot lie down for every million Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost he now continues according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle .
to leave the cash in the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank saf@@ es would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four accidents , I don &apos;t want the fifth one ! , &quot; said the bank manager .
most customers would have an understanding and change to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association Bayern stated : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; to carry it alone , be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; economically not possible economically . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for this reason , some German banks have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thur@@ in@@ gian Volks@@ - und Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger has made head@@ lines with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with in@@ soles for deposits of three million Euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael K@@ em@@ mer , CEO of the Banking Union said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect individuals to pay nationwide fees for deposits , so competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said , at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele endow@@ ed with wealth a little more generous . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they pay for free money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
founded in 1911 , the co @-@ operative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see .
well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no further banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which calculate le@@ verage for deposits of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Federal Association of German People &apos;s B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the negative towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
customers in Germany will not drop in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lon@@ es@@ ome middle @-@ aged men love plates .
before heading to the comments section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ ele of the Middle Ages with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the many @-@ discussed re @-@ emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als , which want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely event group .
it is also not a hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older buyers usually retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending their own time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and stu@@ pe@@ de wild@@ ly before I stop , hold my hands and say something like : &quot; so let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic record shops .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and minds through observation .
Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I of Si@@ ster Ray ( number of people : two young women , three men of middle @-@ aged ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of people : eight men of middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I guess , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , cover the walls of his living room .
the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets may apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the medication , people who heard about com@@ eback and get to see their old records .
from the conversations I &apos;ve conducted , people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom on fans of the record re@@ dress of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a shop like onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing communion of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers accepted imp@@ etus to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that evo@@ ke happy youth memories .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or possession of material possessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally concern yourself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff from a stack of plates fl@@ ares out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while browsing through a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a compil@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works for Sounds of the Universe ( Number of people : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; someone came here only recently and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead ba@@ ffle so I can put them to the shelf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people saying : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who only slowly come in .
F@@ opp , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women .
even if the atmosphere is a bit less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ ast &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex@@ tant pop instead of experimental jazz is re@@ conc@@ iled from the speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but the mental trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of panels available for sale .
it rather makes a window @-@ bum@@ ble than a big shopping cart .
it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting sheets is not a real option , says it .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; it casts off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I appear to mut@@ ate je@@ ans @-@ pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who are group@@ ing together for a moment to group Polar@@ oid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far up that it is impossible to touch them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is pure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; record art . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about .
it is no surprise that a group of people who has more time and money than others is also the one who supplies the most for lux@@ uries like boards .
even though my research has yiel@@ ded that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble through panels of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through panels , while they avoid the star@@ ring look of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false pres@@ enter who spreads over the shoulders of middle @-@ aged men .

French court re@@ jects supply over demoli@@ tion of stores in the jungle refugee camp
a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional businesses where people within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demoli@@ shed because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and san@@ ity risk .
humanitarian groups shared the court that shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than only feed people who live &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the down@@ fall was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; café of the camp , which is operated in no time and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
&quot; &quot; &quot; more than 17@@ 0,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids &apos; Café . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for these children would be a disaster of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite the dis@@ appointment of Olympia : Martin remains milit@@ ant

he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am hon@@ estly difficult to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyze in silence what reasons would have led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
during the World Cup in Qatar in October , Martin really wanted to fight for the title .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time World Champion , who had lost on Wednesday at 5@@ 4.5 km more than three minutes to Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;

group enters the start @-@ up for live video games
watching video games from other people is huge - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology group bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money flow@@ ed for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am started off with his offer in January and already has more than 100,000 users .
they can watch others while playing , but they can intervene on their own .
for example , they can give up missions to players and face enemies as well as provide equipment .
the game display Activ@@ ision Bli@@ zz@@ ard launches a new HD video service for the bo@@ oming world of e @-@ sport .
on the way to the global media event , Facebook is supposed to help .
the advertising industry is already listening .
the start @-@ up staff , which has been based in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft headquarters in Red@@ mond , California , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i announced .
the acquisition will therefore not change anything for the customer .
according to Microsoft , Be@@ am is integrated into the video game department around the Xbox console .
the live streaming market of video game activities is growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube gaming .
T@@ witch was purchased from online retail@@ er Amazon in 2014 - for almost a billion dollars .

here comes the Enfor@@ cement trailer
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers need to focus on the next generation of speed knives : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , which are intended to transfer temperature com@@ post@@ ures very effectively .
the futur@@ istic @-@ looking Enfor@@ cement tra@@ ilers of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accidents where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges with temporary speed poli@@ ces there is often no infrastructure required to provide a stationary flash for adher@@ ence to speed limits .
however , a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly .
the Enfor@@ cement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation ; the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time over several tracks .
variable speed limits , as well as drive @-@ through b@@ ans according to time , lane and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art state you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch .
in order that it is not simply stolen , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and , by the way , also disappear outside h@@ ull .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the car from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
also foreign authorities flash with the new technique : recently France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 units last year .
Britain fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class reco@@ vers Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ year Ru@@ g@@ by reached an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday night in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the Pom@@ odoro Stadium .
Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side @-@ stepping , back @-@ back , line @-@ run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was defeated by the not too bad winning price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final .
but regardless of that , Fi@@ ji would have beaten a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in its best form in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it probably won &apos;t - that at least a br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , Ry@@ an lost each game at Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this cap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fi@@ ji began beautifully and let the attacks of G@@ b jump out of fun .
it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . on as if they were running into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au over@@ lap in the corner .
with just four minutes playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a terri@@ fying T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute , j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua entered a touch down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new one since the start @-@ up and there was still more than a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by more weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings from the UK team and rus@@ hed to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 while GB still taught .
this is how it is .
GB took fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half , until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interplay of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game was long in favor of the South Sea sul@@ phi@@ sts , whose fans sang , flags wave and d@@ anced on the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ am put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB k@@ ink crus@@ hing in the grass .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and the UK pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown beat the Bo@@ ks in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ ined gold than in these games and that will mean what they mean .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an extra significance in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only the din@@ ers who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was omni@@ present when they row@@ ed to the second Olympics in two without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a scale .
their domin@@ ance was absolutely , at least their 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ controlled use , which is also unprecedented .
what we see are two brilliant athletes gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not entirely reflect the type of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said , he ris@@ ked what was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and that &apos;s what they did .
if you don &apos;t do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better again soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough .
that &apos;s how it starts .
rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one .
in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve ra@@ ging morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , who was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s perhaps a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we would be no @-@ one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning haven &apos;t lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up with it .
even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to stop , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start at the same time and at the same time we were not going to make some ra@@ bies .
today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ work , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race we did .
the couple will take a break for a year before making decisions about their future .
next week Glo@@ ver has to appear on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ ground .
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it feels so much better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bay@@ ern@@ ally exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small , Frank@@ ish drinking water purpose association as a model for the large water producers .
this meant that some time ago it was in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio Broad@@ casting .
a little later , the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia paid tribute to the purpose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ te Stone group is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the Association of Emplo@@ ye@@ es , stands for 28 years as Managing Director .
now he was reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
the drinking water purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ te Stone group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brun@@ n , promotes approximately 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ hoff , Breit@@ brun@@ n , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
there are water supply contracts for further towns and municipalities .
the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brun@@ n Mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was hired as a water@@ war@@ ship in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zw@@ eck@@ verband in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and supplements to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the restoration of the high tanks ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the replacement of water pipes .
there has been no stal@@ em@@ ate and it has always been taken up again because water life and drinking water are the most important food .
in her lau@@ d@@ atio , she pra@@ ises Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and proper service over 31 years .
he used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water purpose association and he lived through the water purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago , as a true practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ te Stone group in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia District .
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , in turn , praised the water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ growing and restructuring of the purpose @-@ union .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the rup@@ ture of the pipe at church lou@@ der on January 3 .
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of brun@@ n can only be maintained , because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter , who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
soprano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko goes out with the au@@ tism of her son Ti@@ ago - and addresses other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; medicine has made great progress , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper Cor@@ riere della Ser@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the disease had been recognized by her son , she believed that she had to die .
but the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ti@@ ago went well forward and now learn in private in New York where there are the best therapists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give an example : if I ask him something which dates back two years , when I sang at La Scala in Milan , he re@@ members nothing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Net@@ reb@@ ko . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he is the happ@@ i@@ est man on earth .
Ti@@ ago comes from Net@@ reb@@ ko &apos;s connection with the bass bar@@ it@@ one Er@@ win Sch@@ rott .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man sho@@ ots on partner of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and injured them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself inv@@ oked and told us to have shot his companion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator was on the run , and after him , he was made public .
by now , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ tann@@ ed and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police published a photo of him .
it is , however , a few years old .
in the meantime , the man is bald .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still wear the weapon , the police .
if you see Sven S. , you should call the 110 .
the police speaks of a &quot; relationship . &quot;
the victim was born 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator in 1981 .
the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to provide information on the Ta@@ ther@@ lands or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims ; but she confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a crime of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special application command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - flash@@ light for the German steel industry
the crisis @-@ driven and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of dollars .
financial burdens , which threatened the sector from green electricity subsidies , are from the table .
the German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) in the German steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers , the gases from the blast furnace for producing electricity for their own consumption , to the cash register .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry has an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z , now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent applies .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
with this the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign , this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also in the reform of the emissions rights trade , climate and employment targets are to be weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure .
last year , the situation wor@@ sen@@ ed further than the world &apos;s largest producer of producers in China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the flag@@ ging domestic demand .
European producers acc@@ use Chinese steel corporations price dump@@ ing .
in the course of this spring , the situation has been a bit relaxed .
on the one hand , the import duties on import steel show impact , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
it is unclear how sustainable the price collection is .
German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least the prices would have stagn@@ ated .
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
in the end , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works .
around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel producers remain cau@@ tious in July .
with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced less than six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the quantity produced went back the second month in a row .
since the beginning of the year , production is two percent lower than the prior @-@ year figure .
in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates an increased order situation with an increasing output .
community , Spirit , Health : singing is good
the singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp all her life : as a young girl , she was in school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors choir .
&quot; singing moves me - emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and spirit .
singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the Deutschen Seni@@ or@@ en@@ li@@ ga .
most of the sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular gather@@ ings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp into her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of toge@@ ther@@ ness . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for this , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the d@@ olls in everyday life .
even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age , singing is an ideal hobby .
in elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursul@@ a L@@ enz from the Bundes@@ arbeits@@ gemeinschaft der senior @-@ organisations .
in the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people makes a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escence .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia are dec@@ lining for long rec@@ u@@ per@@ ated events .
in singing , a special power is required for the head , L@@ enz explains .
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone do so not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the feeling of self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show oneself : if I practise for a long time , I will be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens .
there are good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz suggests .
you don &apos;t sing alone - for 50 singing people , who already hears when a sound goes wrong ?
looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings of the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors choir , one can simply join them .
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet .
if you do not have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet search .
those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir , advis@@ es H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react sensi@@ tively as a han@@ go@@ ver to cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals .
to their surprise the mi@@ str@@ ust also did not leave the males cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat babies at the bottom of the little ones .
they react by ten percent faster to sounds of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great need , as scientists have fi@@ gured out by the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; obviously , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and heavily arous@@ ed young for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the caus@@ tic cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were played for a pack of small children , who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ aming of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens who were lifted up in addition .
the researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own offspring , responded differently to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said .
they turned more quickly to the loudspeaker , when the cri@@ es of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be con@@ genital or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby sounds several times in humans .
also , some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , no matter if they were pregnant or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ ung@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ stra@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey an arrest warrant has been issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ stra@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey .
before the Du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ky@@ ries Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ skis Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even with the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government refused to interfere with everyday life of regular citizens .
this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
there is no stop before football .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors issued an arrest warrant against the former Hak@@ an Sü@@ stra@@ r strong champion .
accordingly , the South West living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ me@@ r is said to be the supporters of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of exception suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , but in fact , this has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan to be terminated on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
fans of Bes@@ ic@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
what unites the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ic@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will come again to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne has demonstrated its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final match against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored 1 : 0 victory hit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a conci@@ li@@ atory end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ O in the Champions League the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; f@@ arewell too early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ ver Li@@ g , it only reached sixth place .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we managed it and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ic@@ tas the year was better .
above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who played the base for the 14th title with 26 matches of the season as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ revi@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason for the fans to continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
in doing so , after the coup attempt at AC Florence , only bor@@ eh@@ ole Gom@@ ez had been announced after the coup attempt to not return because of the political situation in the country following his European vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the specialist magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; club chief Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to do so , however , the stri@@ ker would have to be ready to disp@@ ense with around one third of the annual salary paid to 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made it clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chances at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already blocked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other out@@ performed Ath@@ le@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh at it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who after a dop@@ ing @-@ locking had su@@ ed their start right shortly before the games , was whi@@ st@@ led off mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
it offered a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : with a raised smile she was still standing in the hall and had provoked her appearance .
when she saw that she was not going to pick gold , the audience burst into a storm .
but there are still many other athletes competing in the Rio Olympics despite dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was already locked for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion from 2004 and former world champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
shelf @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to shut down a six @-@ month sperm after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ on .
she had a strong tooth@@ ache after an operation , the 29 year old was defending .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic champion , world champion of 2013 and European champi@@ onships from 2010 to 2016 has been positively tested for the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the scientific intake and was blocked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic Champion and two @-@ time world champion more than 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and closed for 21 months .

this year , the 30 year old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ throw , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete got so many med@@ als later .
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after he was diagnosed with testosterone Dop@@ ing .
in addition , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old has also had to release Olympics @-@ silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
he received the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games because of a verdict of the International Sports Court CA@@ S .

Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive in May but may still start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , indications of taking a forbidden dietary supplement have been found ; the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ dly and commen@@ ced on 13 July .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austri@@ ans injured - Sever@@ al deaths
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man for Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already left it again .
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon also Austrian citizens are still unclear .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in first explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening in a Night@@ life .
according to police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning two explosive charges went up again , and another human being was killed according to the authorities .
Ph@@ u@@ ket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured in Det@@ onation near the beach of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with vac@@ ation@@ ers .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police territory .
after all , there were several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast several wounded .
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bom@@ bers bear the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ om@@ av@@ ee Friday morning to journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is too early to express himself about possible motives , but most likely it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not arise in connection with the Islam@@ ist uprising or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
the authorities have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however , they have not been informed of the exact time and places .
it is not yet clear which group is behind the attacks .
police pointed out their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but mostly they do not set themselves against tourists .
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace built over the years by Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
according to the current bom@@ b@@ ings , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities .
high security risk ( level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ ta@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings .
there will be no need to travel to these provinces after clas@@ hes between security forces and Muslim populations .
increased security risk ( level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elabor@@ ated by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ don Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos , while the country is heading towards stability , an improvement of economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , is self @-@ reli@@ ant to have led the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the revol@@ ting revol@@ t of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country .
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago , in Bangkok , 20 people were killed during an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack on the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to several national offices , the Bundes@@ custo@@ dians have also placed the group under observation in the Con@@ federation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see evidence of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for aspir@@ ations against the free democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional protection officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or from the Middle East are being de@@ fam@@ ed in extrem@@ ist fashion .
that is why we are also observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; constitutional protection in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ma@@ arten said that his authority was closely coordinated with the local authorities in the decision . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups such as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the constitutional boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
that is what Islam@@ ists do as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not a real advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should address people emo@@ tionally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; finally , reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians were given from several federal states . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ arten said he didn &apos;t know about that .
for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes so extre@@ mis@@ tic .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons can influence the party .
this is not apparent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal threats and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and asylum seek@@ ers , Ma@@ ined , he would not yet speak of new righ@@ ted terrorism in this context . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but in recent years we have found that there can be legal structures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Fran@@ con@@ ian group .
it may well be that other right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups are planning attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , refugee homes or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not recognis@@ able .
the previous groups were formed on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about the fact that many attacks went to the account of people who had not appeared in the right scene before .
this is the wor@@ rying .
many of the susp@@ ects in attacks on asylum shel@@ ters had previously not been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so many people have committed crimes that were previously indiffer@@ ent to right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who were perhaps politically indiffer@@ ent or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which , however , have radic@@ alised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist mo@@ ods . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records not always determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ it subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his course with a gap of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was rather his not just athle@@ tic figure , which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more well @-@ known .
since most athletes are running in ae@@ dic@@ s , Di@@ d simply wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ it is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred to him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rocker of wh@@ ale &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in reference to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was fun with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only took a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter Fre@@ estyle , played no role .
compar@@ isons with Eric the E@@ el were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 .
the appearance of the float made from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable , when he had to stand alone in a conc@@ entri@@ c run over 100 metres of fre@@ estyle .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

pump doesn &apos;t see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so narrow
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump is speaking at an election campaign in Florida .
should it be done with the choice of US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already made an alternative video .
he then goes on vacation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Donald Tr@@ ump is losing the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the end it will either fold or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television station CN@@ BC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it was not enough for him at the end of political correctness , it was fine , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats &apos; candidate , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the Islamic State terrorist militia ( IS ) .
within his party , more and more resistance was formed .
post enters the trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle by Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter .
the Group will soon begin trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get involved in selling to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been checking for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and par@@ c@@ els are delivered , also to sell to other farms .
post @-@ President Jürgen Ger@@ ber had said there are always questions , such as by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the post @-@ owned factory , the company is planning the construction of up to 10,000 cars per year and layer .
Ger@@ ber announced that the Group would significantly enlarge its fleet of electric cars , and in the long run , it intends to make a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter has been active on German roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP management joins dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges its boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ backs came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K fores@@ had@@ owed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann is all the more uncertain , the longer the success promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg Market Research Company Gf@@ K : after another dis@@ ap@@ pointing down@@ turn and the res@@ ignation of the company management , the number five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
the G@@ RP Executive Board wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the chairman of the Gf@@ K supervisory board Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the management board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger already took over the management of the Management Board on September 1 , divided the company .
he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; Chief Executive Officer &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details did not want to name a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
those who will lead the market research company in the future will be unclear at the moment .
in investor circles it was called on Friday , at last the dis@@ appointment of the continued success of the restructuring initiated several years ago was great .
Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen even after 5 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , every shareholder will some@@ time be rest@@ less .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if that was the case at BMW , that would also make the qu@@ and@@ ts like that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
following set@@ backs in the previous quarters , the Company won &apos;t be able to stop its loss of power in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent lower than in the comparable quarter of the previous year .
sales in the first half of the year rose by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million .
in view of its difficult economic situation , the profit in the second quarter was above all imp@@ acted by the s@@ unken value of the company .
the company value depreciation of 139 million euros , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , weigh@@ ed the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million .
in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight Ver@@ last
in the event of an accident of a touring coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) .
two of the occup@@ ants suffered serious injuries , divided the police .
according to her figures , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to turn out to meet another truck , which drove partially on the opposite track .
the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus on their own , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six rescue cars and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident resort on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ injured travelers were brought back to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n district of P@@ ew@@ sum by a regular bus .
they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the veter@@ ans and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to € 3.@@ 44 for the sewage plant in Neu@@ dorf / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl effective October 1 , 2016 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ ure 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the plant in Az@@ endorf the waste water @-@ fee will increase at the latest , if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the sewage @-@ price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic metre .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported that under the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , Unter@@ cover@@ ungen were established for these sewage installations .
due to legal grounds , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost @-@ saving manner .
from 1 October 2016 the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to fall deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented to the body , a new calculation of fees for the sewage installations of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - and under@@ cover from the previous calculation period will also be out .
Schmidt explained the serious cost increases by applying relatively small facilities in all three wastewater facilities with a very low waste water supply , which lies between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
as a result of the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
in addition , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , due to the age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses , the last period of calculation was not least due to the age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair costs .
the plant in Az@@ endorf was nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ z@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the Az@@ ure wastewater system .
in the pumping station Wel@@ z@@ ahl , the nearly 20 @-@ year @-@ old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground up and in the pond case of Lop@@ p , the first sewage pond had to be dischar@@ ged after almost 20 years , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continuous servicing and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully penet@@ rated . &quot;
Schmidt , the market town of great entertainment costs , has remained spar@@ ed during the past 20 years .
the situation for the aforementioned installations will continue to remain prec@@ arious after the view of stone houses , especially since the supply area of the wastewater treatment association Fri@@ es@@ en@@ bach@@ tal can not be extended because it is about defici@@ ent facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % in July on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first one over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % were posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared with the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured after CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 amounted to 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation rate compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 the following groups of consumer goods were observed in comparison to the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 0.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .
prices remained as in the previous month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Snap@@ chat &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; effect as Asian carto@@ on critic@@ ised . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is not sensitive to races .
with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd .
you can transform into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein picture .
the filters are blo@@ oming , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools that generate over 30 million improved sel@@ fies per day .
all absen@@ ces come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have cri@@ tiques in the past where they were accused of promoting Black face or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them sl@@ otted , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist carto@@ on by Asi@@ ans - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ja@@ un@@ ah . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeti@@ tive controversi@@ es pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage was widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , one day after Snap@@ chat told that it would have de@@ activated the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as carto@@ on by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced rac@@ ism reminded the filter of vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és .
others declined the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely spread , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and mil@@ dly said to be unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very reluc@@ tant Asian carto@@ on and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ layer has been pulled into the depreci@@ ating extreme .
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride threat .
American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are thicker than their older antagon@@ ists in terms of race - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview , she said that ra@@ cial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and finished their article with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colours that work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that has left Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered .
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently hired a HR officer who focused on subordin@@ ated population groups and on internal integration efforts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hu said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they have their Snap@@ chat account closed and added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &apos; . &quot; &quot; &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence services , determines Committee of Congress
military personnel of the United States Central Command modified intelligence gathering information to draw a more optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed , an enquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can Committee of the Military Com@@ mittees , Secret Service Com@@ mittees and the Ar@@ med budget@@ ary Committee , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their app@@ rais@@ als to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; intelligence agencies typically enjoyed by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ ders posted a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently positive than analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; stated K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
the Cent@@ Com management errors reach the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superi@@ ors , a more optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press Rel@@ eases , Stat@@ ements and Stat@@ ements were clearly more positive than the facts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest would begin in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk posed by IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report , published on Thursday , will be complemented by more detailed insights into the investigation .
in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports is underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Ministry of Defence .
the Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday , with some of the Con@@ clu@@ sions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the t@@ all@@ est Democ@@ rat in the Committee , Member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Shi@@ p , in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this process , according to Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; compensated the mor@@ ale among analysts and &quot; gave too little space for different opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the democr@@ ats gave no clu@@ e to the White House interven@@ ing at Cent@@ Com analysts in terms of a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s General In@@ spec@@ tor , who received complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts .
l@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still under way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that intelligence agencies and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions above the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
the alleg@@ ations last year however raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a writing about how the then government led by George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , had a little time trying to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team confirmed that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this finding , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ re@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legislature because of its moder@@ ately positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate .
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
the US is winning fourth match in women &apos;s field ho@@ ckey , show@@ down with the UK
one day after she shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American Hock@@ ey Team of Women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember this ever done .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their gates in mind .
but she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Brit@@ on at the first place , which after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan remain unbe@@ aten .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their six teams .
the first place will take a bit longer for the strong Dutch runners , who lead the other group .
however the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have provoked a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 squares .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had a ho@@ ckey stick in her hands for the first time with three years ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became National Player of the United States , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely moved around the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening , B@@ am opened the doors in the first half of the game with a back@@ hand from the local area .
India went into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 up to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands .
she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball across the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and kno@@ cked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guidance .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline
wherever you are , how late it is , the Olympics are .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable , a rapid relay between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick , which is passed from the wrist guard to the gymn@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the coffee shop during a conversation with your neighbour without hearing about Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the quar@@ rel between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could well have been among these well @-@ known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good TV advertising , if he were a swi@@ mmer , gymn@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic Games .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further to the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular favourite , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so scar@@ c@@ ely perceived that many people I questioned did not know that it is actually an Olympic race .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to competition , it has never won a medal in tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it is suitable for the un@@ explained ear suitable for a c@@ lown school as the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a devoted enthusiasm .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ist tre@@ mor of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the grace of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unites it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a giant trampoline , shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , fen@@ cing and balance ) before they land on their feet .
according to the official Olympic programme , they are assessed according to execution , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete in Rio .
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ ons in their quest for gold have to go far@@ ther , faster , up and over , sometimes down to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground .
they not only ch@@ ase the finish line or the output wall , but in the tel@@ ev@@ ised transmission also another ridi@@ culous goal : that of the world or the Olympic @-@ ords .
the goal @-@ oriented pursu@@ it is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I feel as being a bit ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , moves up , then downward , then effort@@ lessly upwards .
here too there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , not a wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the Olympic Games can only be .
the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.@@ 00 .
in the midst of Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the monkey and the objec@@ ti@@ fication of male athletes - as the male US Tur@@ ner suggested recently according to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base .
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long is an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that the police killed dozens of prot@@ esters during clas@@ hes with the police .
is Ethiopia just collapse in the process ?
in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy .
but during the last few months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and spread to more and more territories .
last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the government &apos;s response was un@@ merciful .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism across the region , especially in Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the country &apos;s opposition has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or in prison , killed or driven into the v@@ ast@@ ness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you are op@@ pressing people and they don &apos;t have any other options other than prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ j@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in central Ethiopia .
the entire youth is prot@@ esting .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition .
after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament .
at the same time , tensions are rising along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are concerned that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , which have been en@@ forced more or less in recent years , can use the tur@@ mo@@ il and re @-@ arm themselves .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de after years of t@@ ink@@ ering under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are .
several young Ethiop@@ ians said that they were so protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from ae@@ dic@@ s predominantly Christian high @-@ countries prosp@@ ered in the politics and the economy as they exploited the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas .
but that is exactly what changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are working under a umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of Oro@@ mos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ mos .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , accounting for around 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in an un@@ published illness for 17 years .
he was considered a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in taking early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to deal with opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the present regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 after thousands of elections were prot@@ esting that , according to analysts , apparently ple@@ dged by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed even if there were less than in the past months and this time of un@@ rest passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in fighting poverty .
but obviously , this did not prevent the internal dis@@ art of Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
last month prot@@ esters attacked Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , Tig@@ ray led businesses and hatred against the Tig@@ ray became more common in the social media .
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flug on neighboring Somalia , even if it recently announced that it has closed this base .
while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama had founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter on Friday the last controversy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the Islamic State terrorist group , not serious .
this clari@@ fication raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans presidential candidate if he was able to communicate clearly and intelli@@ gently with the American public .
it also brings his fellow comb@@ at@@ ants who try to protect him during an event@@ ful period in order to explain to the peculiar position he could not have meant .
having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in reference to the statement on Thursday with@@ drew and insist@@ ed that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the tweet was contrary to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation entirely serious .
when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it .
the last storm of criticism hit Mr. Tr@@ ump while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to h@@ ack Clinton &apos;s e @-@ mails , but later he explained , &quot; Of course , I said that sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates .
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
instead of def@@ ying the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed an even better sound as its poll@@ s have continued to decline .
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , published on Friday , showed a leadership with a big margin in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his sense of humor .
but while reinfor@@ cing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s most prominent advoc@@ ates , made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Mr. Giuli@@ ani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps statements if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true that in front of Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them back@@ bro@@ kers , completely wrong , and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the Obama administration , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs , allowed IS@@ IS to expand by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continues his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being pre@@ ju@@ dic@@ ed against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts trying to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democr@@ ats mo@@ cked Mr Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s ap@@ ology as a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
once crowded by the market , Café is back in Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a sh@@ itt@@ y café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could pay only cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served good coffee for 15 years .
of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were sup@@ planted .
soap Cher@@ ie , which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people used it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it is also rein@@ vention .
a re@@ vit@@ alized Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
coffee is still good .
the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long@@ time employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide money for a new outside office , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps of the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nis@@ hes such as cap@@ ers and aci@@ dic onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , formerly lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and regularly visited the verb .
even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the verb was closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I realized that it was the coffee and the culture in the verb I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now they drink coffee again , even though they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on this day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb in 2003 , Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before the work and always ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth after seven , every day like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
today Ros@@ enthal is still getting his usual order , but sometimes he altern@@ ates his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment on the fact that the soap business took the old business room .
in fact , the owners of soap her@@ y offered to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee of the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will go on their offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants Green@@ points also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he pre@@ tends to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome .
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice bar wants to fill and sell the cold bre@@ w@@ ed coffee to the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a nearby building .
for many customers a new verb is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café closed .
when the new cafe opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined dining of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man .
her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
Co@@ es last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A decent meal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a repor@@ ter at the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , snor@@ k@@ elling snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter ordered ham@@ mer@@ ed , this found the couple suitable for discussing the meal in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ uts , liver cheeses and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must have settled in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paints the paths with which the country was going to be no longer the Cock@@ aig@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious meals , such as bre@@ ads and cre@@ at@@ olls , became stap@@ le foods , the c@@ asser@@ ole as &quot; a wonderful way to re@@ assure food remains , &quot; as chefs were able to hide un@@ pal@@ atable ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury .
strange mixtures were tried out because a low @-@ calorie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchen@@ ware .
during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , brick clay prepared a dish from this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick continues : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
like never before , or since then , budget econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - bes@@ et the country &apos;s eating habits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; home polic@@ y@@ makers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a celebration of historic treats .
particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ E@@ ating attitude .
while publicly pra@@ ising the simple I@@ owa farm kitchen of his kitchen , he feeds like the million @-@ million man from the world to which he has become .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully un@@ realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would not have asked him to stamp an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the hypo@@ cris@@ y of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most desolate . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression tried to deal with food was dis@@ car@@ ded as soon as the country reg@@ ained its feet .
the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food .
the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of the bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw away food .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; brick @-@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was a raid on the wind .
after the plates were cleared at Iron@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought forth a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate at lunch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une Whi@@ p , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man , adding that it was a common trick to miss a modest name . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pr@@ un@@ es , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everyone di@@ ved somewhat reluc@@ t@@ antly using a spoon in the teeth , brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
surprisingly , it was not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer , he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Some chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : he dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even when the Assad regime is bom@@ bed .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a group of civilians who , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved the lives of almost 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own life into the game in order to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian guard , showing him during an 11 hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , according to the picture : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think that God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
just before O@@ mar itself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one that was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now removing the toxic rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the picture quotes his last words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the deadly bom@@ b@@ ings of the Assad regime were supposed to hit terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate animal is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland hair usually comes to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination aboard the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Green@@ lan@@ k@@ sh@@ arks only get offspring with 150 years .
lei@@ surely , the Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average just 1,@@ 220 meters wide .
only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed .
this lifestyle characterized by slow@@ ness , however , seems to be a patent for a high age .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in any case from a Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock , comments on this life @-@ span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates .
in fact , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland would become stone @-@ old .
only lack@@ ed evidence .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they appear on the surface mostly only in winter .
researchers know little about the life of Greenland hair .
their contem@@ por@@ aries measured them , when they paid six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
spo@@ ils make this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may ch@@ ase sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice @-@ sea and look for cad@@ aver consisting of higher water @-@ layers down@@ wards .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sh@@ arks , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ res long , while the largest size was 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucle@@ us .
her birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s , when atomic weapons prevented large volumes of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear arms tests , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 .
all larger Greenland sh@@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ re long Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res may even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Gr@@ ön@@ land @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters , was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
since one of the animals probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland ha@@ y with the reproduction obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time .
this should also be the world record for verteb@@ rates .
the fact that such methane emissions live mainly in icy waters is not a coinci@@ dence .
the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on as@@ par@@ agus fl@@ ames .
they later mature - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : they have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
on the other hand , a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life .
building plot in a double pack
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Municipal Council &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent meeting focused on issues relating to building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the announcement by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the commerci@@ alization of the recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the real estate , par@@ cel@@ list and development questions were clari@@ fied and the applications could be measured , the sale of plots in residential building areas &quot; Road Traffic &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - expansion phase 1 ) is no longer in the way to interested parties .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the farm@@ land in the rural and quiet residential community of Schön@@ au will appeal to young families and sen@@ iors .
as it was said , the volunteers can immediately report to the Town Hall , and the municipal council is expected to discuss the allocation of the plots in its September session .
in order to accommodate requests for the reloc@@ ation of further commercial enterprises , connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
in the area Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the already proven industrial area is extended by two par@@ c@@ els in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
the city of Frankfurt therefore has the best chances of attrac@@ ting jobs and companies reloc@@ ated from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the Financial Markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether banks will continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is not enough for them in the UK to date .
that is what big US banks are using .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lobby association expects 10,000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B risk law .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although Luxembourg is home to a large fund industry , it also cuts out worse in infrastructure as well as Dublin .
thanks to the big airport , Frankfurt is much easier to access .
the city also has easily available commercial properties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it &apos;s not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the Seine , the rental for first @-@ rate commercial real estate was 50 percent higher than on the Main River .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition due to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city stands at number seven , Luxemburg on number 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preference : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concluded I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , will remain the most important financial center in Europe , mean the economic researchers .
the balance of forces : in London according to figures by the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 .
Gilead ob@@ tains legal costs from hepatitis C Patent Li@@ tigation with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. pres@@ enter decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. is entitled to a refund of the legal costs that you have ar@@ isen from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was freed from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for the infrin@@ gement of two patents in Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ of@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct by Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical actions .
at the request filed on Thursday , U.S. Secretary of State Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the costs incurred during the defence of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case goes back to the year 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained and claimed property on laboratory work to whom Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir landed , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead .
U.S. assisted troops say that they have reg@@ ained full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State .
troops supported by the United States have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters left the city , a spokes@@ man of the group said on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ing after the exp@@ ul@@ sion of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city .
they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan informed Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council of Reu@@ ters , alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are carrying on clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the Democrats &apos; presidential candidate and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated USD 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton bought a USD 3 million income from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster &apos;s publishing house for her book on her term in the State Department .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , published his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton .
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ts in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns .
it is common for U.S. presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations even though they are not obliged by law to do so .
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have stated as a reason for ref@@ using a tax check by the tax authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ per Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in terms of the publication of the democr@@ ats presidential candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not completed .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal issues relating to assets , his donations for char@@ itable organizations , his business units and various other connections , in particular with Russia .
Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed into the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ level Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump asks Tr@@ ump to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the topic during a speech to the Economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and to publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
PO@@ L@@ IT@@ ICO has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist in the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case .
Federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton in the past week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat , ump into a meeting to exchange their tax returns .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that he had also been subjected to a tax audit of the I@@ RS , and Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before the elec@@ torate and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released tax returns to the year 2007 .
the Clinton &apos;s , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid on average an effective Swiss tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax declaration by the United States of 2015 showed that these are only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most of the Americans .
her major investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed .

con@@ doms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ works promote dance ani@@ as Ele@@ phant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ y .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who already had the idea years ago , has strengthened its support along with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without inj@@ uring animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves .
Friday is the World Phone Day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , with much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ comb Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps comprise the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the blowing in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chil@@ i cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cable .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom breaks up with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust to the air .
a hint is usually already sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last possibility is a sur@@ fer shooting a gold fire@@ work in the air and causing a loud , bright explosion .
town council unanim@@ ously appro@@ ves : no ki@@ osk building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer

however , the City Council unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new construction of a selling ski at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prompt - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had revealed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin didn &apos;t find an Israeli pre @-@ election because Arab guests had &quot; demanded &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust Docum@@ entation &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; made his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel at the hotel &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ?
she wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center .
searching for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he got there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the pres@@ election be er@@ ased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador to Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident triggered a fairly large response on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel signed the supposed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; demands of Arabic guests &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shame you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; suspicion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; to take Israel into the quick @-@ election list , &quot; said the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
it adds that the country code has been added .
police pos@@ ses tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students joined the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo on Thursday when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police launched tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to police mis@@ si@@ les and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s proposals of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools are closed while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money .
some of the protest participants were spra@@ yed on gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests occurred a few days after prot@@ esters in crowds went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
according to the Russian ambassador to Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade exchange between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 per cent compared with the lifting of the sanctions .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , the interest in Russian enterprises on the part of Russian businesses grew strongly in the country , the ambassador said .
Russian companies are taking on existing ties with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and amounted to $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the trading activity was achieved by supplying machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot; &quot; &quot;
D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan goes out for this year by a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian representation abroad issued around 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries concerned with the number of tourists in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only relatively few Russians are visiting Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change .
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
witnesses sought : beverage market inv@@ aded in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid on Thursday evening has been practi@@ sed at the Be@@ we XXL wine market at the Ger@@ ber@@ straße forest bridge .
under the support of a gun , three dark dressed persons , who had m@@ um@@ bed their faces , demanded from the staff of the drink bar the issuing of cash and then fled first on foot and then presum@@ ably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured does not share the police .
the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters tall , i.e. relatively small .
the beverages market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the perpet@@ rators had to run in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking garage situated opposite the parking @-@ house with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who have made observations at the time of the crime ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , which are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y , should urgently report to the police .
Nag@@ old : games and fun at summer leisure
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the social @-@ pedago@@ gical daily group / social group work of the children &apos;s protection association Nag@@ old with their super@@ vis@@ ors at their summer leisure time in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in the quiet leisure centre Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle the life @-@ joyful group was accommod@@ ated during the first school holiday week .
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand , it went to B@@ lah with the visit of the string zoo .

the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about the daily life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group enjoyed themselves at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and sp@@ lashing .

&quot; &quot; &quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Color@@ ful evening &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage route from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
four stages were tackl@@ ed together .
in order to bridge the time up to the next Rome pilgrimage of all the altar boys in two years , the Sec@@ retariat of St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a several day pilgrimage .
various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the epis@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the open door of mercy on the Fri@@ bourg cathedral was offered a special destination for pilgrims .
16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the holy rooms , went on their way .
in the evening before , Father Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and informed the pilgrims .
von Hor@@ b was driven by rail to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster @-@ Bel@@ oved @-@ loving woman stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster has been started .
each day and evening the individual tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and scrip@@ tural texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is at the cross@@ roads , chap@@ els or churches always made a stop to sing together a song of specially produced pilgri@@ m song .
par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available for overnight stays .
at the stage targets Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller made a tasty and healthy dinner and breakfast .
the second day continued on Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
the next day , the stage went to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but at first it had to climb around 500 metres in high heat and then be heard again .
the deser@@ ved reward was a barbecue at the Bad@@ wei@@ her in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the 4th day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg .
visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy .
God thanks a little impulse here .
at the evening mass in Münster the Min@@ is of Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed on the pilgrimage site .
after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau@@ cho Met@@ ropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
at the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped .
Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storm home , as Br@@ ite Gold is ring@@ ing for cycling
Scotland Call@@ um Sk@@ inner shav@@ ed last night in the men &apos;s team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the young@@ ster proudly made the legend as he rus@@ hed home to win a victory from the favour@@ ites of New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they reached a modest sixth place in March at the railway world champi@@ onships in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap to close Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
Hin@@ du , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner made an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round .
and the British trio has won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Hin@@ di fell short after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking Hin@@ der in a higher gear to slow it down and allow it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace .
Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name for myself .
we set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track .
he later with@@ drew this statement and there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
in such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the grand@@ stand like London . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we &apos;ve come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we are expecting successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Ho@@ ys &apos;s win of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( an apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a spo@@ ils of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
that would be the same as that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilomet@@ re race .
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will certainly focus on security .
he had fought with official representatives yesterday when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time advanced in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on his strong train crew to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a thr@@ ong of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down .
they played a drama in the background , the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and bul@@ lying , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks quite like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which at the perfect moment reached its cul@@ mination , can be repeated again .
the future of the sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the cancellation of the energy yield
the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts as the supplying energy company has announced .
this step followed the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is scheduled for November .
up to 2,000 work@@ places in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 work@@ places - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure .
in addition , it could lead to dom@@ ino effects as the melting process uses around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which eventually led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea Super@@ power plant last year .
the melt @-@ melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last but not least due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium carp@@ entry with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where the Chinese C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means a further physical demand for electricity by melting it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which should have come into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , AG@@ L expects the contracts to contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the current supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the contracts in its annual decline of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the melt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to ensure the power supply to the sm@@ el@@ ting &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have come into force from November this year , even if it is yet another explanation why it res@@ ig@@ ned from the contract .
due to the poor economic conditions in the branch , analysts warn against the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
in reference to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of power per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generating set , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality TV Star , Kendall is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September edition of the US Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Kendall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an like ? ) , seen reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ en@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forgot the cover of their sister and ends with a classical twist : they all planned a surprise party .
this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on girl on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris needed to let her other girls take part in this publicity .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , safety has begun a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
she likes her big sister Kim in terms of the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself .
the September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference that more resembles a picture book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were on the 8@@ 32 pages of the company 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) .
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin have been le@@ aked before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
in recent years , more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who are mo@@ oring &quot; as &quot; models , celeb@@ ri@@ ties are &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the little chance that Mrs. J@@ en@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous people or reality stars or young@@ sters of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even if everything is true to J@@ en@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who are involved in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course J@@ enny &apos;s success does not like everyone .
with her reality TV story , J@@ enny &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ en@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mist@@ resses of the moment . &quot;
these feelings boiled again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but going around on the m@@ ole seems to pass by at the point .
Kendall J@@ en@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she is running for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters are selling pictures of them on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine TV .
and in her spare time she is watching Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
municipal law centers annually assign 16@@ 0,000 people
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s aid organisations are aver@@ ted annually by the municipal fen@@ cing centres , while the sector is focused on the effects of further mi@@ tigation on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land three of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who do not have any means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication and the like - are rejected by their request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services provided by the municipality , which have already been over@@ ly utili@@ sed , are ready for further cuts .
as of June next year it is fores@@ een that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal resources .
the Director of the District Church of Que@@ ene James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Federation of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dismissed every year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without a repe@@ al of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community law centres are under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people are rejected by important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and de@@ pressing debts , families that go through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the federal government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately stop these short@@ cuts so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government filled up its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their clients , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work .
Donald Tr@@ ump Camp@@ aig@@ n accused of allegedly drawing up arms
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign has been accused of alleged in@@ activity after telling that their campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun weapon on a staff in February , while they were travelling in a je@@ ep in February .
the incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i had been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Earl Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the barrel at Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after compl@@ aining to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons do not need to be fired to damage any damage , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment only comes two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd of people in North Carolina that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment Men were to take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judges were to appoint .
Tr@@ um@@ ps &quot; campaign made it clear that the media had viol@@ ated his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
B@@ ordin@@ is complaint requires compensation from the campaign for breach of due dili@@ gence and Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps press spokes@@ man Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a comment .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before federal elections : losing SPD and CD@@ U
in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CD@@ U are notable .
these are representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey data in Berlin .
in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to head the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , the SPD decreased from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago .
according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come to 23 per cent again .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previous 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country &apos;s parliament .
in spite of light losses , the Gre@@ ens rose again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite light losses of 6 per cent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent respectively .
according to the pol@@ l of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD expects the pol@@ l to be only 23 per cent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
this makes it still behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return but the pir@@ ates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the success@@ ors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a pound and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 .
it was thicker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand .
on the contrary , it was quite bul@@ ky .
the built @-@ in memory initially came to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would suff@@ ice today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 Gigabyte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; came into business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few Euro fans can still buy the devices on the Internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet era .
however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; office in western pocket format &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
indeed , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards a lot : SMS and emails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator .
even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers , al@@ beit tra@@ vers@@ ing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , about 1400 euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
the smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold to Microsoft and handled .
the market today dominate vendors who came all a lot later than Nokia .
being online always and everywhere is today &apos;s everyday life for many people .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
sold around 1.4 billion devices , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running shops of the countless App providers and the telecommunications companies .
in the meantime , a whole industry has been developed around the smartphone .
the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple boss Steve Jobs at the Mac World announced the launch of the iPhone .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communic@@ ator , all via touch screen easy to use .
the Apple trium@@ ph@@ al proc@@ ession began , and today the iPhone is the main product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look .
you eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get out of the smartphone , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of staff in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now a curse and a blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we took a big effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from playing .
the Olympics gave great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities , we are already building 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , creating 40,000 new jobs and ending youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s enlargement is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will da@@ zzle on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had injustice in 2012 and they will lie wrong even at He@@ ath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every question asked to him .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project .
extension is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in atmospheric growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and throughout the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 to the top five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the midst of the world &apos;s two @-@ frequency cat@@ walks .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the London games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I &apos;m confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as safeguard our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; &quot; &quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass the ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block display block@@ ages on its desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus published a blo@@ gger where users could update their filters in the program to further block advertisements on the social network .
on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop page would change the coding regarding his adver@@ ts to make it difficult to recognise the recognition of what part of the page is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blo@@ gger post , the spokes@@ man for Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her battle between the all@@ uring open source community and the b@@ yp@@ assing has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how high @-@ wor@@ rying indicator block@@ ers have become for the industry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ unt@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display block@@ ers ; almost four times as much in 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
apart from the fact that mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , a spokes@@ man shared .
advertising on desktop PCs has a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad Pre@@ ference tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday Facebook commented that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced a Facebook spokesperson on an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control over people &apos;s hands .
mist@@ ress of suspected suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was lying on the motorway in the middle of the night .
the police call witnesses after a woman was driving on a motorway in the early morning hours on Thursday after a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was tried by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as any witness of the incident encouraged to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , distributed G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not responsible .
in each of the two cases - in which a person walked on the highway in the dark - it was decided that drivers should not assume that a pedestrian walks in the middle of the night on the motorway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after she had crossed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became un@@ conscious on the street , the court missed .
the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman who responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way - and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Air Gri@@ m@@ am@@ o@@ del : Venus was once inhabited
the Venus was probably inhab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA Air model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus through tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could have had er@@ d@@ similar conditions .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ gy atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on .
the model also lit the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably had more dry areas than de Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to house life and protected against rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of Venus expon@@ enti@@ ally increases its day @-@ length of the sun for almost two months , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Com@@ io in a press release . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun &apos;s heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus , which is similar to evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was blown away by ultra@@ violet light .
as its Hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climatic model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy goes back as coach of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy retired as a trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che on Thursday and led to low involvement in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last three years , I have fulfilled my duties as Chief Executive Officer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations , Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer , I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , it needs it and bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations has to be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that affect the performance of the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these conditions are currently not met .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contribution to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best coach of the league .
he took the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches earned a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , resume strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the struggles with regard to wages for North Sea workers are suspended while all the conflic@@ ting parties sit on the table for a new round of talks , negoti@@ ators said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Wood Group and the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the settlement process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day meetings over the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , the Wood Group has cut the rates of its contrac@@ tors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressures .
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 @-@ percent decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the UK energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that was reinforced by the British ruling in June , the European Union .
Scottish Par@@ liam@@ entary Member , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest disputes that took place in the North Sea for one generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country , we need an economy which works for many and not only a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected to be spent on new projects in the North Sea in comparison with an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years .
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler &apos;s Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate in different rates and in what context the rotation periods are associated with the formation of planets .
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ thood .
they are now the fastest way .
at peak rotation rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars exp@@ el large quantities of star win@@ ches .
as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- such as sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more massive stars rotate more slowly than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars moving slower than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Star of P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is still much to learn about how , when and why stars dec@@ eler@@ ate their rot@@ ational rates and so to speak hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in three newspaper reports about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a controversial basketball star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base to Base .
after his emotional release announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es a last time on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say good@@ bye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was elected to the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract awarded him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will act as a consultant and coach coach with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid for a long time with performance .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ uns , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he managed the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys only two more bas@@ eball players assign similar values to the most important stat@@ s .
nevertheless , the 41 year old should not be included in the bas@@ eball hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial his appearance is outside of the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star appeared at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , he was closed down to 211 games due to a involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the principal suspect to have received high @-@ performance funding for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
after a law@@ suit the lock was reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also his f@@ arewell @-@ days are not silent .
while many bas@@ eball legends hit the big stage once more in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez had to sit on the bench frequently .
&quot; my job does not include a f@@ arewell tour . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es coach Joe Gir@@ ardi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told the situation with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , got the sympath@@ ies of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ ri@@ vals Boston red so@@ x .

Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Richter are first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian aims not to start from Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing incidents .
a caught ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh race day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter obstacle runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already cri@@ tically acclaimed athle@@ tics competitions these news came to an end .
in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was proven last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ ked agent for dop@@ ing substances .
on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had reserved the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butter@@ fly , only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to take part in the courses over 50 m of fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) applied for the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
for the first time in history , IO@@ C is no longer responsible , but CA@@ S is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also at night from Rio the news spread about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; An unbelievable shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the female ath@@ lete . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said that the forbidden substance is the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT the B sample should have already been positive .
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately reported speech to the ath@@ lete .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation must not participate in Rio .
on Friday , the case &quot; Adrian Target inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days earlier on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon .
both deny the intake , however , both of them must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before the start of the athletes , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the World Association IA@@ AF has banned the entire Russian team from the start to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , including the native country of Kenya producing many bad news in Rio .
in addition , the previous mer@@ ging in China caused violent confron@@ tations between athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t took the Chinese Olympic champion , Sun Y@@ ang , har@@ sh@@ ly .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2014 , Sun was positively tested with the stimul@@ ant tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din in Chinese nation@@ als , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock .
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers her ran@@ som
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and they are successful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of surv@@ ey@@ ed companies over the past twelve months have been at least once , sometimes repeatedly victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 per cent of the victims voluntarily paid the ran@@ som sal@@ aries required by the perpet@@ rators to re@@ use the challenged systems and data .
according to the observations by Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes , the perpet@@ rators specifically speci@@ alize in attacks in corporate networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially for@@ mid@@ able ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising .
then the offen@@ ders discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was very fast in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files as well as on archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
in order to get the encryption code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ pro@@ ung Bit@@ coin .
but where private users have the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without having to shut down production .
accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware falls .
22 per cent of the German companies reported sales losses through ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operations , in one case people were in danger of life .
in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpet@@ rators in the face of stal@@ em@@ ate in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
in a recent study , the security researchers of F @-@ Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and came to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain to their victims by chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites , or dec@@ r@@ yp@@ t free example files .
and if private persons are saved after payment of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to retrieve their data un@@ encrypted .
in view of the potentially high and relatively risk @-@ free wins from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that it is about three or four people .
the programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software tool@@ kit to the actual black@@ mail@@ ers .
the malware kits so far have been created by purchasing the malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the black@@ mail then searches for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually the criminals monitor sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of the IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey hope to be able to ward off ran@@ som@@ ware by file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
consequently , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful edi@@ fication , the offen@@ ders thre@@ aten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things .
at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som .
if the offen@@ ders then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .

Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the little HR @-@ V Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little Coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ v@@ ans .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the HR @-@ V is only 1.@@ 60 m high , the passengers have plenty of room both in the front row and in the rear , it doesn &apos;t work in any place .
the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit top is falling apart .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles for storage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l in case of raised and 10@@ 26 l in folded back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space , which is 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the luggage compartment can be loaded well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp gives the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
however , he is likely to make his work a little qui@@ eter .
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort .
the steering is expected to be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the city emergency braking assistant ( operates up to 32 km / h ) , the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ates because he judges many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when maneu@@ vering . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic signs detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
the full connectivity , however , is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two USB and one HDMI socket lie under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emissions standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the c@@ amber of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Düsseldorf Higher Regional Court argued ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) , which is typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee @-@ hole in the fall .
but the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline had to pay no damages to the man .
case of illness : when pays the organizer
sick holi@@ day@@ makers will only get money back after their trip , if the cause of the illness is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than ten percent of guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of her birth .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a defective sewage treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip had been defici@@ ent - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the wastewater treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organizer learned about it only shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , so the judgment .
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violence committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorists .
surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph for the terrorists .
if criminal offen@@ ders would have to leave the country more quickly , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for the refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a tran@@ sposition of proposals until the 2017 Bundestag election .
he also announced another personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in a medium @-@ fourth order of magnitude over several years . &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
video surveillance should be improved , the weapon rights are amended in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult .
the last much @-@ discussed duty of confidentiality for doctors is to remain respected after de Ma@@ izi@@ ère &apos;s words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to seek solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , as the endanger@@ ment of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support necessary .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is planning the deployment of concealed investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the interior minister pointed out clearly against the action of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel told the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka prohibition and the aboli@@ tion of dual citizenship .
he considers a general prohibition of full @-@ wear to be un@@ constitutional problem@@ atically .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you reject , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
it is possible to talk about rules for example in traffic or for witnesses in court .
green boss Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating action and capacity to act with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fleet Sp@@ rü@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring the people in this country no more security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better flow of traffic on the motorway bridge
it is st@@ owed regularly on the circum@@ fence - here a picture of November .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this is to change : the legal referendum is to be extended . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a good news for all the car @-@ drivers who are standing in traffic on the ambient street every night in traffic jams , if they drive over the motorway at Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
road construction is extended on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler Straße the right @-@ bending road by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer road on the right .
the big advantage : the traffic is shared early so that the overall procedure is improved on the busy section of the federal highway 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district council of Münster @-@ West .
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder nerves the drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the return road reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ go road and sometimes also beyond .
the reason for this is the needle eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic is guided only one lane via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rec@@ eded more than three @-@ quarters years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge does not have the necessary load capacity to absorb the heavy @-@ duty traffic two @-@ lane .
as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the associated work @-@ day traffic jam will continue , the competent state company cannot fail .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official period of rest until 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the legal ab@@ bi@@ quity the state company deliberately chose the more traffic weaker time during the school holidays , because it has to be reck@@ oned with disabilities .
the traffic will be conducted on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Offers for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the Wald@@ schule is visiting the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the boys &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Theater Münster &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the Small House .
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , provides schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster within the framework of this project .
most young people of the class had come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , according to the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg out of language , and the young theatre will work in the coming season as part of a music theatre project .
between October and December young people with and without refugee and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany at night a stroke by the bill - but there is still hope .
the night has been bad due to clouds and rain , to observe the heavenly spectacle , said the president of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see a lot of shooting stars in the sky .
the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which are one of the fastest shooting stars with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour .
they have their name because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep far before the alarm @-@ ring@@ ing .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing .
how do sleep problems manifest themselves ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there are many causes behind them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , member of the German Society of Sle@@ eping Beauty and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what one sees in the country is , however , the In@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an entry and diar@@ rhe@@ a disorder .
straight through sleep many people feel un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ kne@@ cht , board member of the German house medical association with practice in Var@@ el , Lower Saxony .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
there may be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also drugs .
not in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early awakening is most common in depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Weber . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poor@@ ly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts thinking about everyday problems and worries , shoot an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I use sleep disorders to become a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor , tells We@@ eks .
the impair@@ ment can look quite different : one is beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has trouble with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical discomfort such as stomach ache or head@@ aches .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks .
there is hardly a lowered sleep @-@ physician in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary Sle@@ ep Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the family doctor , tells We@@ eks .
this can be clari@@ fied by studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to the sleep lab , and what happens ?
for an investigation in the sleep lab , doctors suggest snor@@ ing with breathing replac@@ ements , in case of daily fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia , or if one does not find the cause of a failure disorder , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare yourself for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just don &apos;t make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after sli@@ mming you go to bed at his normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a sensor on the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping @-@ ends .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sleep for better sleep .
shoot counts : regular sleeping and standing times , do not sleep too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not beneficial .
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing division of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he took gold for the first time at the World Cup Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ tem@@ per via Facebook protected himself in front of his ex @-@ team@@ mates .
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets € 20,000 bonus and a jungle king 15@@ 0,000 € should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page during the night on Friday .
the convey@@ ance system in swimming is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and don &apos;t look so closely with the subject of dop@@ ing , or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ f would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency of Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS by independent Contro@@ ll@@ ers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not take part , &quot; says the election ham@@ bur@@ gers , who meanwhile operates an ice cream shop .
airport : Ban@@ de arrested by baggage thi@@ eves
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
prosecution of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years was successful on Thursday .
the susp@@ ects had committed several bags of bags and baggage .
at 9.@@ 30 pm civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport again recognised a gang known to police officers from past acts of theft .
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July and had proc@@ eeded in a common , cooperative and particularly professional manner .
the specialists of the criminal investig@@ ator 34 can provide evidence of the di@@ vines that had come to Germany for alleged off@@ ences to Germany .
in total , they had a total of over 15,000 euros .
old buildings , a few lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain Street works at first sight , but the police are counting them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when you cross the road from the east to the west , you pass play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has spra@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the facade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartment rentals will be built here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as known as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain , is portra@@ yed in recent weeks , however , preferably with burning cars . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , now the ten@@ ants have le@@ ases , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , the Berlin @-@ based internal sen@@ ator Henkel has spoken out several times for a police action against the project - the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after having been cleared with 300 police officers on the ground floor on 22 June , the police pat@@ rol three weeks in official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground , locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 .
meanwhile , building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later the police and construction workers went under the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the street is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are chat@@ ting with pro@@ m .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many local residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has three children here , are mostly driven by the police presence .
they share the care of increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication with the inhabitants of the house projects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it doesn &apos;t sound like a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kie@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that mostly wanted police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ ating left . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the dit@@ ch that the Berlin In@@ ner sen@@ ator and the police between house occup@@ ants and their neighbours does not exist so clearly .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class quarter , which also today compared to the rest of the city a low average and high poverty @-@ risk .
also house occup@@ ations and the living projects born out of it belong to the neighbourhood quite a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them nearly the entire Mainz street quite close to the Rig@@ a@@ er .
while the Main@@ zer had been swe@@ pt under a large police force in a real street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are partly occupied by the people they had occupied 26 years ago .
at the same time , the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll@@ in@@ ators from all over the world in recent years : people from GDR times and former Haus@@ occup@@ iers share their neighbourhood with them .
this is reflected in the rent , which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen in bon@@ ded windows or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with paint bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other street was mentioned this year so often in conjunction with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily imp@@ acted by crime : crimes like bodily injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the offen@@ ders make property damage , which tends to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in a rented house next to the controversial 94 , there can be no talk of in@@ security .
as for acts of violence , it is appe@@ al@@ ingly : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , they were not meant to be .
the famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the Riga Road - and remained .
that is why it was so important for her to get back the street : from the police , politics and the media , who suddenly stressed the sovereignty over the district in July .
but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away from them : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former construction gaps that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well infected live here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what shall we do if someone never hears ?
fru@@ stration is on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for immigrants who are anno@@ yed about color bom@@ b@@ ings : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belong to the Kie@@ z .
who draws near should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub quarter , can complain about noise .
all persons mentioned only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is New Refu@@ ge@@ e Repres@@ entative
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in matters of integration and organisation .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of administration for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working groups , refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which has a problem above all .
in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than on the other hand - had deliberately aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meaning that the administration wanted to write out the job .
an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , was sought .
but administrative work is not its central area , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent job for three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine told us that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are great and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
the responsibility changes from the district office to the commun@@ e and the job center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
in fact , the administration does not find private apartments .
so far , it is not possible to rely on private apartments , according to Deu@@ sch@@ le .
that is why common apartments have to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , apprentices@@ hips , school grounds , one @-@ Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be rounded or set up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more places would be good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many work in the building yard or help house masters , perform non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a firm structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer .
people need to develop a sense of belonging .
so we need offers such as sports , local contacts and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so here also administration and volunteers jump .
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of the time , for example with language courses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if someone eventually creates the feeling that he can &apos;t help in Ur@@ bach , he can &apos;t work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself .
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell customers honest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all this is already a mamm@@ oth task .
a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent incidents , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve may call . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and may not exclude them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the car@@ egi@@ vers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents were also a topic among the refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would make them complete .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
therefore main and honorary members have to look for activities locally and in the region .
they have always in the background that a new push in refugees and migrants could soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors .
actually it is unfair to put them on the spot .
&quot; we have not yet arrived in Ur@@ bach , where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , this would relax the situation .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher have already been utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner .
these are currently about 100 people , mainly young men .
but when people are in need , one must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : intru@@ der with helicopter looked for
the police helicopter flew several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
