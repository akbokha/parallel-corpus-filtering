<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sport pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sport pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they chased home to the feeding troughs in a quick gallop.</seg>
<seg id="7">One kilometer at this pace, I was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus ended the riding career again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - was again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let his family run over the ALRV and on a horse he didn't even bother for photo purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport-aid handed over the Golden sport pyramid to the man from Anhausen in the context of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">The sympathetic athlete does not lack awards.</seg>
<seg id="16">German Federal Cross of Merit, silver bay leaf, Champions Tour player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already begged him.</seg>
<seg id="18">Long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen, on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "this award means a lot to me," "" "says Langer," "" "because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades, Langer has been supporting young generation.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros right away.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US master winner was included in the" "" "Hall of Fame des deutschen Sports" "" "on Saturday." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">The athletes are athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the gymnasts Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthum the handball Erhard Wunderlich.</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "invest in infrastructure and prevent TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two U.S. presidents do not agree on tax and energy policies as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is based on a fundamentally philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to control the economy and regulate it to death, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">He will go back to regulations massively, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower taxes - for private people and for businesses.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Clinton says:" "" "the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has disadvantaged opportunities to open and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">That is why taxes would be increased for the rich, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the future, Trump and Clinton say almost identically.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the rule of the state-critical party wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">Thus, non-party discussions might come to trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "the differences in energy and climate policies are more clear." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production is also to be possible in previously protected areas, the Paris climate protection agreement wants to announce it.</seg>
<seg id="20">Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand the renewable energies with their investment program: "a country will become the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want we to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transpazied trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, both do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply to better protect American jobs.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid even better, says Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to raise it to 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics charge him that the budget deficit would only be greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least from the rich, is that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant physicians have called upon their union to approve new labour campaign measures in their dispute regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work campaigns from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns regarding the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">In July, assistance doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract that was agreed with the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">In a letter to the members who were released on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government "persistently calm" would have had problems, which led to the rejection of the treaty.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Russia and Turkey: an" "" "alliance of outsiders" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot deny that Ankara would most want this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was a handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smiles seemed too timid, and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "however, Recep Tayyip Erdogan repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing that he mentioned in his introductions: the launching of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border by Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was angry.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater because it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuilding the veto becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the accusations made by senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan to listen to.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of ceasefire are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after having been removed from his office last month with a failed coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terror attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular banning charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the state television forecast cheaper fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti formulated it as follows:" "" "tourists there, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious at the West as it considers its response to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "in addition, the ongoing resentment on the EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool mood and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara to claim support for the elected state authorities in Ankara following the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow which itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace on the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an "alliance of outsiders" to me as an analyst: two countries which violate the West and feel bad and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The greatest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played its role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents were said at the press conference that they hadn't even stripped the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise it.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey poured out the Russian military jet - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian President humidifies Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov unexpectedly.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of the closest trust of Putin for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed the Special Representative for Environmental and Transport Affairs.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin it is that Putin ordered the dismissal of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been Deputy Director since 2012, was appointed to succeed him.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked at the Embassy in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is said (in Russian) that he later was Chief Executive Officer and Chief of Staff of the Government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said to Putin about his appointment:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as Head of State on bills and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV channel on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do you see the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of the closest confidant Vladimir Putin for a long time and worked as he worked for the Soviet secrecy, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, aired on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official statement - that a man who was once touted as a potential president once would lead the Russian environmental policy - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin cited on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said it is true that I asked you to talk to me in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - entrusting these difficult items for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people, whom he most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term Putin had violated the constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another closest ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before returning to the president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The project's £1,35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>

<seg id="7">The project, which is a £1.35 billion, is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown visited the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historic and symbolic moment when building Queensland crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, nearly 79% of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck is today in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="13">Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing, Constructors, said: "the first closure is a major milestone in every bridge project.</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of trendsetting civil engineering and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After installing the last section of the road and its connection with the northern tower on the North Tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the shore.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, about 6,000 tons and had to be moved upwards at an ascent of about 3%.</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "the SPD and the Greens are saying: investors should be taken seriously more strongly in the future." ""</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD is proposing a" "" "Concept of Action" "" "to the next session." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, the question is: who should build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">So far, a provision is lacking.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "said S & D Group President Christoph Bratmann:" "" "we agree with the Greens: anyone who wants to build on urban areas must in future pay 20 percent of all homes as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">The favorable apartments, however, can also arise in the continuance.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big dispute in the town hall is, according to Bratmann:" "" "how to deal with investors who want to build on private grounds?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors on these areas to build at least 10 percent, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "a new municipal housing development programme, which will cost millions of dollars and still needs to be financed, should provide incentives." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "the problem, says Bratmann:" "" "there is currently no agreement between the factions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make as few rules as possible to investors.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Despite this, according to Bratmann, a sharpening of the situation on the housing market is underway.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the program is still not entirely: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compensate for the loss of further around 1300 cheap apartments whose funding will run out over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">Only by 2020 there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, according to plan-policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, current bindings should now be purchased from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to return apartments back to price binding.</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">At one stroke, the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For the end of the year, deadlines run out in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments one could get back to the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: they do not want the owners, the apartment building companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social dwellings in the Western city is drastically increased again, they are removed from the aim of the so-called mix.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "group leader Holger Herlitschke writes:" "" "the CDU must go into the boat for a broad majority." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that's worth it</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children don't go outside to play anymore, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people away from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time at the screen was initially limited to the TV, then to video games and recently limited to smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is therefore great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">It goes without saying that I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990ies (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created from it).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, interest has fallen before the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand at the beginning of July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon that are tracked with a GPS and, once found," "" "photographed" "" "(using a screenshot on the mobile) or" "" "captured" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the madness and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "in the U.S., the game led to a considerable increase in steps the" "" "average" "" "person withdraws every day." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35,000 users, announced the Washington Post recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of subsequent people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is going to play Pokémon Go - it just looks the raw data for the increase in performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes" "" "to" "" "get away from the sofa" "" "and" "" "go every day" "" "met deaf ears, because many public messages are boring for health and come from people that look miserable." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overvalued.</seg>
<seg id="19">Anyone who regularly sports sports reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to attract them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even include new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As usual, there are also muerous gamblers who have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even if Smartphone Apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sport as this game does.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its charm and the use will decrease over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="7">Breathtakingly on the ground.</seg>
<seg id="8">Brilliant all the way.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally also the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast kicked off on Thursday for a multi-fight title and increased the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her total score of 62,198 was clearly before the Silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Americans Simone Biles performs on the balance beam during the single campaign of women in the gymnastics event at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-battle title and overall the fifth while holding her call to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This achievement puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the last three years her sport, 15 world championship medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">She was expecting a final examination in Brazil, a competition that was not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi-stage women in the gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="20">Biles took the first medal on Tuesday while at the farewell celebration of the retired man coordinator Martha Karolyi served as exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Biles insisted, during their long journeys to the top, never have planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Some of her floor exercises - which contain her typical tumbling pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boorman's mother during a school excursion into the gymnasium, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, she has not lost a competition, a series of victories that will last as long as Biles desires.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafina easily led through two turns, the picture clouded.</seg>
<seg id="27">Swedish bar and floor gymnastics - in which Biles holds the World Championship title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got up again with 15,433 on the deck of Swedes - and with a 15,933 on the floor there was another one.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her grandchild - a pure formality - and tears poured on fine shiny red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "this time, the 22-year-old male captains called" "" "Grandma" "" "had a lead." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">After her floor exercise she threw the audience into kisses, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful.</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were killed, who died in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first mass murder of Phoenix, while they stopped in the car and listened to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a single drive, the authorities said.</seg>

<seg id="5">The police informed that the threefold murder did not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the aggressor did not take the handbags or the $2,900 owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">The police spokesman of Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investigators to take a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven persons were killed in nine attacks and two more were injured in Hispanic neighborhoods within four months.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "it happens in a residential area in front of a house," "" "told Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">It is assumed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown Nissant from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to reveal the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same murderer.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized due to their injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report on the shooting, which depended on an empty pickup truck for half an hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the serial killer's work.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's Olympics in the gymnastics and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">First, I have been with each summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three turneresses, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, who is a Catholic, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">At the last Olympic Games Gabby Douglas was a surprising Olympic athlete and America cheered.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the three World Championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, how they provided unexpected but masterful Gymaize routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual multi-event event.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this type of sport, but as a result, gymnastics all over the country do not look like this.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie hit all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "" "because the next Olympic team will have only four gymnasts in the team. it is also the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sports and gymnasts come primarily in private gymnastics, which are maintained by parents, who pay for the training, setup, travel, competitive and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnastics lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both trained their athletes since they started their gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to aun the congregations around innumerable young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easily accessible gym exercise.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my 20-year foundation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In my events we have offered free and affordable gymnastics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban teenagers (mainly black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health and for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that encourages thousands of young girls to be interested in the gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team and thank you so many young girls with different backgrounds are motivated to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistance physicians would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed agreement with the functionaries of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistance physicians agreed to vote rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July, Hunt's plans were unveiled to introduce the treaty and said that the NHS was in a "no man country" and any further delay would be harmful to employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first residences are to receive a new contract which includes changes to night and weekend examinations to improve the care at unscheduled times.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA Committee for Assistance Doors announced last night in a message: "assistance physicians have serious concerns about the proposed deal, in particular that it will heat up the current occupation crisis and treat it to meet all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">In only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and the time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes through talks have met with the government on reluctance and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">This happened after a promise made by Jeremy Hunt last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now, lift up the constraint and address the concerns of the resident doctors." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike post.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA would like to spend a better week's remuneration for the 54.000 assistance physicians who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, General Director of the NHS Employees, called upon the assistance doctors to terminate the strike.</seg>

<seg id="16">In the last two months we have spoken to the committee of assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblower with the Ministry of Health and other ministries.</seg>
<seg id="17">The employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important topics such as posting, flexibility in training, additional training for those who returned from a professional expulsion, training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - a sign of how serious they were the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulating medication Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="7">Some 140,000 people each year suffer a heart attack and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulations of fatty material in the artery walls, which form coverings.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the topping breaks apart, it can cause a blood clutter causing the flow of blood to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clot dissolves, it can flow through the bloodstream and block the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">People who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, produced by the British company AstraZeneca and distributed under the trade name Brilique reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, which was published today, recommends a 12 month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Centre said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered from a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">The fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person's quality of life.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that in combination with aspirin, Ticagrelor is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">Information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed from office last year due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities, ignoring a devastating government report today.</seg>

<seg id="7">At present, a voter only has to name his name and address.</seg>

<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way" and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobic accusations.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him."</seg>

<seg id="20">In his report, it says: "as evidence was attached that pressure was exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, especially Communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi backgrounds.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabt for a guide his tongue in the dirtiest places in Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller subjected his immune system to a serious test by leaking up some of the dirtiest and disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">The presenter and chauffeur Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk switched his train on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a pull knob of a train toilet and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before dragging each object, he used a luminance meter to show himself what he is going to get.</seg>
<seg id="5">But the experiment, which was filmed under the title "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results to daylight.</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea of replacing the purge of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact, there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and healthcare professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Luckily, nothing left behind what he licked up, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright became known for testing the resistance of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public banisters to railway stations to flush bones of toilets, the task established its immune system definitely under a rehearsal</seg>
<seg id="11">In the film he said: "as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His trial line showed a luminance of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to this, the luminous intensity of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to refuse after their luminance amounted to over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says," "" "This comes close to the worst thing I have done in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I'm not going to check here because it is disgusting indoors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company provides Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the advancement of intestinal bacteria and the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "validation Senior Research President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer the consumer something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "we performed crazy brainstorming that ended saying" "" "Let's call us Ian." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health will become a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who led the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others where this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio from 2015, 84 percent of all respondents associated lactic acid bacteria in particular associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they at least occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">An asocial family left their social housing after a delotion with a loss of £50,000 because they had terrorized their neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldone and her partner Shaun Treportcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After being forcibly removed from the property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found the property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had perforated holes, wooden planks were torn open, trash was scattered on the floor and graffiti was smeared on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is assumed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the housekeeper at Cornwall Housing, said she feared that the apartment was no longer to be repaired.</seg>

<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment meanwhile and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, striding and curbing.</seg>

<seg id="27">He added: "it is a shame that the tenant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, since delogation is always the last step taken into consideration by Cornwall Housing.</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behavior was extreme and their actions had to be horrible for their neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="6">A Kenyan functionary had informed that the former Sprinter and present coach, John Anzrah, had handed a urine test under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich in the Olympic village.</seg>
<seg id="7">This has been reported to the leadership of Kenya by doping controllers.</seg>

<seg id="18">The World Anti-Doping Agency had put a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil, to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't receive anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">They understood it in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in 2021 the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">Because it's not stupid as until now: summer holidays, heat and rural elections - that is biting.</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the campaigners, are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most vacationers traveling in the country, on Usedom, Ruegen or Hiddensee, are not locals, so you can't choose the country day.</seg>
<seg id="8">In addition, there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers, posters hang up, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and count out voices in the end, only to rub magnificently.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass election campaign short of the people over itself.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say that at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, head of a SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end coalitionist.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the land, spreading roses and chatting a little with the people, just as it did his legendary eloquent predecessor Harald Ringstorff.</seg>
<seg id="16">Otherwise sea-ering got cold feet and Chancellor Merkel sets the blame on the thriving of the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "her refugee policy, her" "" "We create that" "" "has accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the nice office." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">The CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when at the wrong time one makes election campaign at the right place.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to make a major event; the German Federal Chancellor Merkel is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree, it was more Nordrhein-Westfalen, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "there was probably the majority from other federal states," "" "said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Otherwise, the Nordost CDU largely waives the usual electoral stands on marketplaces and in front of malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, says Kokert, plays only a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "" "" "the Union has also noted that in the country you are brushing off the basis that it has to be very strict, again to find a wire to the people." ""</seg>
<seg id="26">It is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the expanse of the country.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU election winner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-exposing: "they must go where it hurts, namely, where people are: Dorffeste, Golden marriages, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because a lot is at stake, Sella called his SPD to a particularly committed election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just under the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">At the election of 2011, the SPD had clearly won 35.6 percent in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in polls, should make the leap into the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-emergency and move mostly on the Internet to their election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "online election campaign" "", "it calls the president Claudia Müller." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Apart from that, green campaigners go on search for local vocal aprons among the vacationers.</seg>
<seg id="35">Silke Gajek, the top candidate, just curvades with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful.</seg>

<seg id="2">At the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="3">For those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 a.m. and end only at 8pm, there are all praise.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "they have done everything pretty shaky," "" "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet petrol station." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">"" "" "" "praised is also the return of those responsible for the construction work, for instance when it comes to the establishment of house entrances." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site was migrated to the south on Monday and also the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place has eased.</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from the B 27 from the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "" "" "there were considerable problems," "" "says the deputy head office manager Florian King responsible for the transport management of the refurbishment." ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The residents of Bacherstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schleichwege sought and rather trusted their Navi as the signposting.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks are franchising in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since speed limits were not complied with, the municipality also called for the measuring vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself aware of the situation on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been injected.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road with 77 km per hour in the tempo-30 zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">But since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to revenue outbreaks can be seen through everyone who asks.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and less affected.</seg>
<seg id="24">Those who have less to do with the "end customer" are produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "Thomas Sulz also speaks of a" "" "maximum decline" "" "at the car dealership Maier, but also admits that of course" "" "the running search is missing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily captured are the local bars along the road.</seg>

<seg id="28">This is already existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit him hard. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing.</seg>

<seg id="34">He had to leave half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government-president Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner whether there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant should benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now they must also bear the disadvantages arising from the renovation.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where so much more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">In all lamentations, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">Finally, the family-run business has been here since 1715, he refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">It is possible to understand that other regulars visit less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you cannot approach, it is also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts that his pedigree is returning to the end of the restoration work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner considers the effects of the B 27 construction work on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-term history.</seg>
<seg id="44">Six months of construction work, that's already brutal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonesome middle-aged men love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before heading to the comments section to see him under the pseudonym non-allele of the Middle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the many-discussed re-emergence of records is not attributable to a boom in millennials, which want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to mid-life nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely event group.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older buyers usually retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending their own time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stupede wildly before I stop, hold my hands and say something like: "so let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - still there is still a handful of fantastic record shops.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to evaluate their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I of Sister Ray (number of people: two young women, three men of middle-aged) to Reckless Records (Number of people: eight men of middle-aged, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I guess," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3,000 or 4,000 panels.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), cover the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford than they appeared and again buying items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things in which I was probably a little too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone and add: "I don't smoke and I don't drink very much.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets may apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people who are affected by the medication, people who heard about comeback and get to see their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations I've conducted, people usually get rid of their collection around 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom on fans of the record redress of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a shop like onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing communion of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers accepted impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to move back to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possession of material possessions as a kind of consolation," "" "says WEZ." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally concern yourself.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff from a stack of plates flares out." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet heard them.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report I would probably look very worried while browsing through a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works for Sounds of the Universe (Number of people: three middle-aged men) has noticed a "trophy aspect" of the revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "" "" "someone came here only recently and said," "" "I don't own record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead baffle so I can put them to the shelf," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people saying:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who only slowly come in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is a bit less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesize and sextant pop instead of experimental jazz is reconciled from the speakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but the mental trauma is hard to detect when standing next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of panels available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-bumble than a big shopping cart.</seg>
<seg id="50">It doesn't deserve much, so collecting sheets is not a real option, says it.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "it casts off with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I appear to mutate jeans-pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who are grouping together for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are thinking about buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far up that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">"" "it is pure" "" "record art." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that every attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a group of people who has more time and money than others is also the one who supplies the most for luxuries like boards.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research has yielded that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in record shops in Soho, do not take into account the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumble through panels of Berwick Street and the leaves through panels, while they avoid the starring look of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who spreads over the shoulders of middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional businesses where people within the camp sell goods, cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which contain a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the court that shops and restaurants were important as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 provisional businesses but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were "absolutely understandable."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than only feed people who live" "" "in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting places between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the downfall was the Jungle Book Kids' café of the camp, which is operated in no time and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "more than 170,000 people have signed the petition to keep the Kids' Café." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian it was said that the closing" "" "for these children would be a disaster of which the youngest eight years old are." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="3">The futuristic-looking Enforcement trailers of the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accidents where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or to rehabilitating bridges with temporary speed polices there is often no infrastructure required to provide a stationary flash for adherence to speed limits.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation; the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be recorded at the same time over several tracks.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits, as well as drive-through bans according to time, lane and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at the 7-year Rugby reached an abrupt halt on Thursday night in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the Pomodoro Stadium.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji gave a master class in handling, side-stepping, back-back, line-run and raw power to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was defeated by the not too bad winning price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The distinct defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that, Fiji would have beaten a 15-man-team in its best form in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for GB - but it probably won't - that at least a brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, Ryan lost each game at Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this cap will hurt, but progress is amazing." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began beautifully and let the attacks of Gb jump out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co. on as if they were running into running buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 to the top, when Osea Kolinisau overlap in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner he turned around.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone Nakarawa to score a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute, jasa Veremalua entered a touch down in the right corner and stood 0-17 for the UK.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new one since the start-up and there was still more than a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou competed by more weak Tacklings from the UK team and rushed to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7 while GB still taught.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB took fundamental changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for a whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half, until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant interplay of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game was long in favor of the South Sea sulphists, whose fans sang, flags wave and danced on the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliam put the icing on the cake with another try in the last few seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the Fijis hugged and GB kink crushing in the grass.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji had defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and the UK pressed South Africa in a tight half-finalmatch from the race - Great Britain's conversion of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown beat the Boks in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a gate among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late tackling by Marcus Watson, Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="2">There will be no more emotined gold than in these games and that will mean what they mean.</seg>
<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took an extra significance in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only the diners who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was omnipresent when they rowed to the second Olympics in two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British sport that laid such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Their dominance was absolutely, at least their 39.ter uncontrolled use, which is also unprecedented.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletes gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not entirely reflect the type of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference and no one was more instrumental than the coach who did not know 30 months ago whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said, he risked what was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and that's what they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you don't do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better again soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in the hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">That's how it starts.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one.</seg>

<seg id="5">This meant that some time ago it was in the original sound in a contribution of the Bavarian Radio Broadcasting.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later, the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia paid tribute to the purpose.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veite Stone group is" "" "exemplary" "" "for Bavaria." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this, Rupert Göller, who was 31 years in the Association of Employees, stands for 28 years as Managing Director.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he was retiring at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The drinking water purpose association of the Veite Stone group, located in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, promotes approximately 150000 cubic meters of water per year and supplies 32 places and hamlets with about 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are the municipalities of Kirchhoff, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the city of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">There are water supply contracts for further towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairwoman, Breitbrunn Mayor Gertrud Bühl (FW), recalled that Rupert Göller was hired as a waterwarship in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the Zweckverband in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organisational activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and supplements to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As outstanding events she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain (1994), land purchase in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the restoration of the high tanks (1999), the re-purchase of a central computer control system (2004) and the replacement of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no stalemate and it has always been taken up again because water life and drinking water are the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her laudatio, she praises Göllers loyal, reliable and proper service over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He used a lot of lifeblood for his water purpose association and he lived through the water purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago, as a true practitioner, he was allowed to present the success concept of the Veite Stone group in front of the water forum of the Lower Franconia District.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received a lot of recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, in turn, praised the water wart Alfons Griebel who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best waterman and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the well-growing and restructuring of the purpose-union.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult application were the rupture of the pipe at church louder on January 3.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">Also the supply of brunn can only be maintained, because one filled the high reservoir of Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Sturmer from Lauter, who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - flashlight for the German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-driven and energy-intensive German steel industry remains unaffected by additional costs in millions of dollars.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens, which threatened the sector from green electricity subsidies, are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">The German Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD), said the "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" (WAZ, Friday issue) in the German steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers, the gases from the blast furnace for producing electricity for their own consumption, to the cash register.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the German industry association, the steel industry has an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year.</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ, now there is a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel mills, an EEG levelling of 20 percent applies.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">With this the status quo of the previous regulation is largely fixed.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance." ""</seg>

<seg id="17">Since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and considerable price pressure.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation worsened further than the world's largest producer of producers in China threw masses of steel on the world market in view of the flagging domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European producers accuse Chinese steel corporations price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has been a bit relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand, the import duties on import steel show impact, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least the prices would have stagnated.</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the end, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">Despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel producers remain cautious in July.</seg>
<seg id="29">With 3.4 million tonnes, they produced less than six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, as the Steel Business Association announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the quantity produced went back the second month in a row.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production is two percent lower than the prior-year figure.</seg>
<seg id="32">In the coming months, the Association anticipates an increased order situation with an increasing output.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, Spirit, Health: singing is good</seg>
<seg id="2">The singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp all her life: as a young girl, she was in school choir, she finished the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the Deutschen Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most of the seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular gatherings, seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience has also made Ursel Kipp into her choir:" "" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of togetherness." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand his lungs will not get out of the dolls in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice in old age, singing is an ideal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">In elderly people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Bundesarbeitsgemeinschaft der senior-organisations.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the joint singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people makes a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their adolescence.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia are declining for long recuperated events.</seg>
<seg id="19">In singing, a special power is required for the head, Lenz explains.</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone do so not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition you experience through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The feeling of self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show oneself: if I practise for a long time, I will be better and alert beyond me - this experience strengthens.</seg>
<seg id="26">There are good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">If you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz suggests.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - for 50 singing people, who already hears when a sound goes wrong?</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings of the circle of acquaintances in a seniors choir, one can simply join them.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you do not have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the internet search.</seg>
<seg id="35">Those who want to sing should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the calls of cat babies have on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">To their surprise the mistrust also did not leave the males cold - however, they always behaved the same in contrast to the females.</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of arousal of cat babies at the bottom of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">They react by ten percent faster to sounds of kittens who are in great need, as scientists have figured out by the Veterinary Academy and the Hannover Medical School (MHH).</seg>
<seg id="6">Males also react to the calls of kittens - however always the same.</seg>
<seg id="7">"obviously, the acoustic differences between the mistrust of less and heavily aroused young for the males are either not perceptible or not of importance," said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the first author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">In a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the caustic cries differ with the urgency of their dependency.</seg>
<seg id="10">A total of nine adult males and eight kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were played for a pack of small children, who were taken out of the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">On the other hand, they were confronted with screaming of more strongly excited kittens who were lifted up in addition.</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers maintain their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had not had their own offspring, responded differently to the screams," Konerding said.</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned more quickly to the loudspeaker, when the cries of the very excited kittens played.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be congenital or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "" "said the biologist." ""</seg>

<seg id="8">According to police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians.</seg>
<seg id="9">Friday morning two explosive charges went up again, and another human being was killed according to the authorities.</seg>
<seg id="10">Phuket also reported a bomb explosion in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">A taxi driver was injured in Detonation near the beach of Patong, which was popular with vacationers.</seg>
<seg id="12">In Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee.</seg>
<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police territory.</seg>
<seg id="14">After all, there were several detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon at the south-east coast several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">One goes from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bombers bear the same signature," "" "said Army General Danai Kritomavee Friday morning to journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that this is a coordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it is too early to express himself about possible motives, but most likely it is about the actions of Muslim rebels." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not arise in connection with the Islamist uprising or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It is rather assumed that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">The authorities have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country in recent days - however, they have not been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is not yet clear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">Police pointed out their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but mostly they do not set themselves against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace built over the years by Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">According to the current bombings, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends on its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhtaa as well as Preah Vihear and surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">There will be no need to travel to these provinces after clashes between security forces and Muslim populations.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased security risk (level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution elaborated by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Praydon Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos, while the country is heading towards stability, an improvement of economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is self-reliant to have led the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military has not managed to get a grip on the revolting revolt of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Almost a year ago, in Bangkok, 20 people were killed during an attack on a popular Hindu-shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack on the country's recent history.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to €3.44 for the sewage plant in Neudorf / Welschahl effective October 1, 2016; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3.36 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azure 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the plant in Azendorf the waste water-fee will increase at the latest, if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the sewage-price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic metre.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported that under the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, Untercoverungen were established for these sewage installations.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal grounds, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the plants at a cost-saving manner.</seg>
<seg id="6">From 1 October 2016 the citizens and the industrial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to fall deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented to the body, a new calculation of fees for the sewage installations of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- and undercover from the previous calculation period will also be out.</seg>
<seg id="10">Schmidt explained the serious cost increases by applying relatively small facilities in all three wastewater facilities with a very low waste water supply, which lies between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">As a result of the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">In addition, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, due to the age of refurbishment and repair expenses, the last period of calculation was not least due to the age of refurbishment and repair costs.</seg>
<seg id="14">The plant in Azendorf was nearly 30 years old, the plants for Welzahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt explained that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the Azure wastewater system.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the pumping station Welzahl, the nearly 20-year-old conveyor systems had to be overhauled from the ground up and in the pond case of Lopp, the first sewage pond had to be discharged after almost 20 years, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation can be installed in order to meet the water legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continuous servicing and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level during the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the low waste water fall in the three plants the expenses for operation and maintenance were fully penetrated. "</seg>
<seg id="20">Schmidt, the market town of great entertainment costs, has remained spared during the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">The situation for the aforementioned installations will continue to remain precarious after the view of stone houses, especially since the supply area of the wastewater treatment association Friesenbachtal can not be extended because it is about deficient facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">"" "Snapchat" "" "Anime" "" "effect as Asian cartoon criticised." ""</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is not sensitive to races.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool, Snapchat enables about 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can transform into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein picture.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are blooming, self-propelled tools that generate over 30 million improved selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All absences come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have critiques in the past where they were accused of promoting Black face or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slotted, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics called a racist cartoon by Asians -" "" "jaunah." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repetitive controversies pointed to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage was widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, one day after Snapchat told that it would have deactivated the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of vulnerable clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others declined the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweet about the photos was widely spread, wrote that the filter was "hurtful and mildly said to be unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very reluctant Asian cartoon and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not yellow-faced, but that the yellow-layer has been pulled into the depreciating extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride threat.</seg>
<seg id="18">American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are thicker than their older antagonists in terms of race - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was earlier," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete their Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview, she said that racial controversy reflects a lack of diversity in the settings practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished their article with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colours that work there but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say what to say."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that has left Snapchat largely unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday, Snapchat refused to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a spokesman, the company recently hired a HR officer who focused on subordinated population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">"" "Zhu said," "" "I wonder if they have their Snapchat account closed and added," "" "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K. '." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence services, determines Committee of Congress</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command modified intelligence gathering information to draw a more optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, an enquiry committee of the Congress reported in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">The preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican Committee of the Military Committees, Secret Service Committees and the Armed budgetary Committee, reports of great discontent among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their appraisals to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "" "" "intelligence agencies typically enjoyed by high-ranking CentCom Commanders posted a positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed and were consistently positive than analysis of other intelligence services," "" "a newspaper article cited the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives.</seg>
<seg id="7">The CentCom management errors reach the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government peaks under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts were exposed to pressure from their superiors, a more optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press Releases, Statements and Statements were clearly more positive than the facts," "" "stated the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest would begin in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigation, so much is clear." "" "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed the intelligence reports to reduce the risk posed by ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The republicans called the Task Force after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report, published on Thursday, will be complemented by more detailed insights into the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigation of CentCom reports is underway by the General Inspector of the Ministry of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="18">The Democratic Members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday, with some of the Conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "" "announced the tallest Democrat in the Committee, Member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Ship, in an opinion." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">This process, according to Mr. Schiff, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," compensated the morale among analysts and "gave too little space for different opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the democrats gave no clue to the White House intervening at CentCom analysts in terms of a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's General Inspector, who received complaints from CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the reports of the congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector are still under way.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also stated that" "" "experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data, and that intelligence agencies and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions above the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">The allegations last year however raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of disputes over ten years ago, when a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a writing about how the then government led by George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, had a little time trying to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team confirmed that contrary to the government's statements, airstrikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would not have any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This finding, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centres damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticized by members of the legislature because of its moderately positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing in front of the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin was retiring in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at the Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="2">One day after she shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American Hockey Team of Women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember this ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "I have no idea." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their gates in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">But she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are in their group with the Briton at the first place, which after their 2-0 victory against Japan remain unbeaten.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will gain the first and second place within their six teams.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first place will take a bit longer for the strong Dutch runners, who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">However the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have provoked a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 squares.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had a hockey stick in her hands for the first time with three years (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became National Player of the United States, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>

<seg id="18">We have completely moved around the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening, Bam opened the doors in the first half of the game with a backhand from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India went into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 up to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a sprint with the flat ball across the left flank, then moved to the middle and knocked the ball into the goal to give the Americans a 2-0 guidance.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final goal in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the US, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, the Olympics are.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel constant and inevitable, a rapid relay between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick, which is passed from the wrist guard to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the coffee shop during a conversation with your neighbour without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the quarrel between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could well have been among these well-known names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good TV advertising, if he were a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further to the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular favourite, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so scarcely perceived that many people I questioned did not know that it is actually an Olympic race.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines and until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend her gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it is suitable for the unexplained ear suitable for a clown school as the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a devoted enthusiasm.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the cartoonist tremor of his never-ending impact - but also the grace of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "the word" "" "Trampoline" "" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" "" "springboard" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a giant trampoline, shoot nearly up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, fencing and balance) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">According to the official Olympic programme, they are assessed according to execution, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallions in their quest for gold have to go farther, faster, up and over, sometimes down to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They not only chase the finish line or the output wall, but in the televised transmission also another ridiculous goal: that of the world or the Olympic-ords.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as being a bit tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, moves up, then downward, then effortlessly upwards.</seg>
<seg id="34">Here too there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, not a wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the midst of Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the monkey and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US Turner suggested recently according to the Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long is an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that the police killed dozens of protesters during clashes with the police.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just collapse in the process?</seg>
<seg id="6">In the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a fast growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But during the last few months protests against the government shook the country and spread to more and more territories.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the government's response was unmerciful.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to keep this country together and in the future it will be even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies work closely with Ethiopians to fight terrorism across the region, especially in Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the country's opposition has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or in prison, killed or driven into the vastness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you are oppressing people and they don't have any other options other than protesting, it breaks out," said Sejm Teshome, a teacher in central Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth is protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold in relation to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">After a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time, tensions are rising along the border with Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are concerned that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which have been enforced more or less in recent years, can use the turmoil and re-arm themselves.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode after years of tinkering under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the Internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said that they were so protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">For eons, the Amharas, who come from aedics predominantly Christian high-countries prospered in the politics and the economy as they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is exactly what changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are working under a umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, accounting for around 6 percent of the population and dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister for 17 years until his death in an unpublished illness for 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was considered a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in taking early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to deal with opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the present regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "the last time Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005 after thousands of elections were protesting that, according to analysts, apparently pledged by the government and subsequently stolen." ""</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed even if there were less than in the past months and this time of unrest passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in fighting poverty.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously, this did not prevent the internal disart of Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters attacked Gondar, an amharan city, Tigray led businesses and hatred against the Tigray became more common in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflug on neighboring Somalia, even if it recently announced that it has closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin tightrope walk." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama had founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to scatter on Friday the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the Islamic State terrorist group, not serious.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans presidential candidate if he was able to communicate clearly and intelligently with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings his fellow combatants who try to protect him during an eventful period in order to explain to the peculiar position he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">Having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump in reference to the statement on Thursday withdrew and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning weet on Friday Mr. Trump, he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was contrary to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation entirely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate did not want to know anything about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism hit Mr. Trump while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to hack Clinton's e-mails, but later he explained, "Of course, I said that sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then rowing back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his ways to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates.</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">Instead of defying the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed an even better sound as its polls have continued to decline.</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, published on Friday, showed a leadership with a big margin in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is generally trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his sense of humor.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while reinforcing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze has brought his loyal companions to the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him regardless of how provocative his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps's most prominent advocates, made great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments" "", "Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumps statements if Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true that in front of Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called them backbrokers, completely wrong, and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the Obama administration, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, allowed ISIS to expand by taking control of the situation in the Middle East aggressively.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continues his attacks on the media and accused them of going around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts trying to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr Trumps's apology as a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a shitty café in Williamsburg where you could pay only cash, which had no Wi-Fi, but served good coffee for 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course, the prices from his Bedford Avenue shop front were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">Soap Cherie, which replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people used it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know, New York is change, but I can still not believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel except and Verb is now a soap business."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it is also reinvention.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revitalized Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">Coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a longtime employee of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new coffee shop.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and remained there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide money for a new outside office, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnishes such as capers and acidic onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>

<seg id="1">The depressing food of the economic crisis in "a plentiful meal"</seg>
<seg id="2">In March 1933, shortly after his ascension to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office.</seg>
<seg id="3">As a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a Faible for refined dining of Fifth Avenue such as Pâte de foie gras and Maryland water turtle soup.</seg>
<seg id="4">His menu on that day was a bit more modest: filled eggs in tomato sauce, mashed potatoes and dessert a plum pudding.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman.</seg>
<seg id="6">Her husband Andrew Coe added, "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple live in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">Coes last book "Chop Suey" acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book "97 Orchard" about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "her latest collaboration," "" "A decent meal" "", "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snorkelling snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in store since the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>
<seg id="12">When the reporter ordered hammered, this found the couple suitable for discussing the meal in the era of Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "rich foods were very popular," "" "said brickman." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">There were peanuts, liver cheeses and bean bread.</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "it must have settled in the stomach like lead," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>
<seg id="20">Teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "" "a Square Meal" "" "paints the paths with which the country was going to be no longer the Cockaigne." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central, tense subject," "" "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The new budget was just as tense: mysterious meals, such as breads and creatolls, became staple foods, the casserole as "a wonderful way to reassure food remains," as chefs were able to hide unpalatable ingredients under a creamy sauce.</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">Meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury.</seg>
<seg id="26">Strange mixtures were tried out because a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction had priority over taste or even healthy kitchenware.</seg>
<seg id="27">During her research for the book, which also includes recipes, brick clay prepared a dish from this epoch, baked onions with peanut butter.</seg>

<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions fit together.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the home recipes.</seg>
<seg id="32">Like never before, or since then, budget economists - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - beset the country's eating habits.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines, they encouraged women to become" "" "home policymakers" "" "and the challenge of turning Pampe like creamy spaghetti with carrots into delicious meals." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a celebration of historic treats.</seg>
<seg id="35">Particularly tasty are the reports on the response of the government to starving citizens, such as President Herbert Hoover's Lass-me-Cake-Eating attitude.</seg>
<seg id="36">While publicly praising the simple Iowa farm kitchen of his kitchen, he feeds like the million-million man from the world to which he has become.</seg>
<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderfully unrealistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake if his wife Eleanor would not have asked him to stamp an example with his stomach.</seg>
<seg id="41">As described in the book, the hypocrisy of a housekeeper with no interest in flavors by Ms Roosevelt suggested that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington, but also one of the most desolate. "</seg>
<seg id="42">Many of the species from the era of Great Depression tried to deal with food was discarded as soon as the country regained its feet.</seg>
<seg id="43">The legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food, said Ziegelman, as well as how science was applied to food.</seg>
<seg id="44">The couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of the brickman's mother-in-law when writing the book - for example how she could not throw away food.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "she had a real fear of the waste of food," "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "brick-man remembered:" "" "she really made people sick." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="47">There was a raid on the wind.</seg>

<seg id="50">There was no whipped cream, only prunes, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon.</seg>
<seg id="51">Everyone dived somewhat reluctantly using a spoon in the teeth, brown glibber.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandshark: the oldest vertebrate animal is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland hair usually comes to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an examination aboard the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenlanksharks only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely, the Grönland-shark swims along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average just 1,220 meters wide.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal at this top speed.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle characterized by slowness, however, seems to be a patent for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" "" "Science" "" "in any case from a Grönland shark who could be 392 years old." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, comments on this life-span, which means a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="12">In fact, the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland would become stone-old.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they appear on the surface mostly only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the life of Greenland hair.</seg>
<seg id="17">Their contemporaries measured them, when they paid six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">Spoils make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice-sea and look for cadaver consisting of higher water-layers downwards.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues investigated 28 Greenland sharks, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimetres long, while the largest size was 502 centimetres.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it will no longer be renewed later.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">Her birth was therefore to lie in the early 1960s, when atomic weapons prevented large volumes of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear arms tests, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">All larger Greenland sharks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 amounts due to cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14 clock showed a 493 centimetre long Grönland shark an age of 335 years, while the record shark with 502 centimetres may even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Grönland-shark-females only get offspring if they are longer than four meters, was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals probably stood on the threshold of sexually mature with 392 centimetres and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland hay with the reproduction obviously can be at least one and a half centuries of time.</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methane emissions live mainly in icy waters is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">The previous record holder, a 211-year-old Grönlandwal, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures the organism of the animals living there frequently runs on asparagus flames.</seg>
<seg id="36">They later mature - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface through which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: they have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many descendants as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">On the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust Documentation "Shoah," made his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four day pilgrimage route from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">Four stages were tackled together.</seg>
<seg id="4">In order to bridge the time up to the next Rome pilgrimage of all the altar boys in two years, the Secretariat of St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a several day pilgrimage.</seg>
<seg id="5">Various pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the episcopal city of Freiburg, where in this year on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mercy with the open door of mercy on the Fribourg cathedral was offered a special destination for pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the holy rooms, went on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, Father Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimage and informed the pilgrims.</seg>
<seg id="8">Von Horb was driven by rail to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster-Beloved-loving woman stands and so the pilgrimage route from Münster has been started.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each day and evening the individual tours were framed by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and scriptural texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis at the crossroads, chapels or churches always made a stop to sing together a song of specially produced pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">Parishes of the local parishes were available for overnight stays.</seg>
<seg id="12">At the stage targets Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller made a tasty and healthy dinner and breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="13">The second day continued on Furtwangen to Gütenbach.</seg>
<seg id="14">The next day, the stage went to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but at first it had to climb around 500 metres in high heat and then be heard again.</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a barbecue at the Badweiher in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">After the morning impulse on the 4th day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter we went to the final stage to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="17">Visibly relieved and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy.</seg>
<seg id="18">God thanks a little impulse here.</seg>
<seg id="19">At the evening mass in Münster the Minis of Kooperator Markus Obert were welcomed on the pilgrimage site.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the divine service, the pilgrims were able to visit the sacristy and the high altar.</seg>
<seg id="21">The next day was still time for the Breisgaucho Metropolis.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the afternoon we went back to Horb by train.</seg>
<seg id="23">At the end all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland Callum Skinner shaved last night in the men's team Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team defended the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role that his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the youngster proudly made the legend as he rushed home to win a victory from the favourites of New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they reached a modest sixth place in March at the railway world championships in London despite the return of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindu, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy won - and Skinner made an Olympic champion in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won in the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio has won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Hindi fell short after his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a major part of the transformation taking Hinder in a higher gear to slow it down and allow it Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindu when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "" "it's a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an Olympic champion in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kennys and Hoys side, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He later withdrew this statement and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">In such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "he said," "" "It feels like the whole UK flags on the grandstand like London." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We've come so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation that won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months, we are expecting successful five days in Velodrom.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is in the realm of possibility that he repeated Hoys's win of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">That would be for Kenny - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (an apparently holy date for British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a spoils of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part in the sprint that starts today and will go over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I just enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "he said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified themselves with the fastest performance in the four-kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London 2012, was at 3: 51.659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will certainly focus on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with official representatives yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time advanced in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on his strong train crew to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a throng of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">They played a drama in the background, the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and bullying, as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">However, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrome, it looks quite like the legendary reputation of GBs, which at the perfect moment reached its culmination, can be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts as the supplying energy company has announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the government's decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is scheduled for November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2,000 workplaces in the facility of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 workplaces - direct and indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could lead to domino effects as the melting process uses around 10 percent of the entire power generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which eventually led to a closure of the Anglesea Superpower plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt-melt of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last but not least due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, supplying the large aluminium carpentry with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts.</seg>

<seg id="2">Kendall Jenner, 20, model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September edition of the US Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="3">Antonio, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran on the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on her Instagram account.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "" "" "in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," "" "wrote Kendall." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The cover of the cover was followed by a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashian like?), seen reality video showing the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (except for the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forgot the cover of their sister and ends with a classical twist: they all planned a surprise party.</seg>
<seg id="6">This represents the stereotyped action almost every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon girl on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris needed to let her other girls take part in this publicity.</seg>
<seg id="7">With regard to the September issue of the Vogue, safety has begun a new era of kardashians.</seg>
<seg id="8">She likes her big sister Kim in terms of the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to see in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for herself.</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">With a circumference that more resembles a picture book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According to Fashionista were on the 832 pages of the company 615 pages advertising).</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the Bulletin have been leaked before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">In recent years, more "celebrities who are mooring" as "models, celebrities are" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous people or reality stars or youngsters of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who are involved in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="19">Of course Jenny's success does not like everyone.</seg>
<seg id="20">With her reality TV story, Jenny's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense.</seg>
<seg id="21">In June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her "the mistresses of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings boiled again when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But going around on the mole seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She is running for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all her sisters are selling pictures of them on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her pictures of Cindy Crawfords's daughter to the magazine TV.</seg>

<seg id="3">The incident is described in an indictment filed on Wednesday in Charlotte by Vincent Bordini, a former software programmer for the campaign in this state.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "Bordini had been waiting for months to have been waiting for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that" "" "that would not happen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "the campaign leader, Earl Philip," "" "pulled a gun, put his right finger on the trigger, and rammed the barrel at Vincents Kniekeh," "" "gave Bordini in his indictment." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">After complaining to the local and regional campaign leadership, Bordini noted that at least four more people had the same experience with Phillip, he stated in the indictment.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "" "" "weapons do not need to be fired to damage any damage," "" "said Bordini." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">The indictment only comes two days after the Republican presidential candidate sparked a turmoil when he told a crowd of people in North Carolina that the Second Amendment Men were to take action if his rival Hillary Clinton was elected and judges were to appoint.</seg>
<seg id="9">Trumps "campaign made it clear that the media had violated his words from the context and that he would not incite violence.</seg>
<seg id="10">Bordinis complaint requires compensation from the campaign for breach of due diligence and Philip for bodily injury and permanent psychological damage.</seg>
<seg id="11">Trumps press spokesman Hope Hicks was not to be reached for a comment.</seg>
<seg id="12">Try to contact Philip as well.</seg>
<seg id="13">WCCB, a local news channel in Charlotte, reports that Phillip is no longer a member of the campaign.</seg>
<seg id="14">Not responding to calls from his consulting company, Innovative Consulting Services.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has so far led a controversial campaign.</seg>

<seg id="2">In the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18), considerable losses for the governing parties of the SPD and the CDU are notable.</seg>
<seg id="3">These are representative surveys of the opinion research institute INSA for the "Bild" newspaper (Friday).</seg>
<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could continue to govern in the north, this is not possible after the survey data in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both states, the SPD would be the strongest party and would thus have a good chance of continuing to head the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, the SPD decreased from 35.6 percent to 24 percent five years ago.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party was only slightly ahead of the CDU, which could come to 23 per cent again.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previous 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the country's parliament.</seg>
<seg id="10">In spite of light losses, the Greens rose again in the Schwerin Landtag despite light losses of 6 per cent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP were not represented in the Landtag with 3 per cent respectively.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the poll of the Berlin Chamber of Deputies, the SPD expects the poll to be only 23 per cent (election 2011: 28.3 percent).</seg>
<seg id="13">The CDU reached only 18 percent after 23.4 percent.</seg>
<seg id="14">This makes it still behind the Greens by 19 percent (2011: 17.6 percent), but before the left at 15 percent (previously 11.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="15">The AfD would be represented at 14 percent for the first time in the House of Deputies.</seg>
<seg id="16">With 5 percent, the FDP could hope for a return but the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011.</seg>

<seg id="2">E-Mail and Internet in slow motion: 20 years ago the Nokia Communicator came to the market.</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a pound and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite bulky.</seg>

<seg id="13">Indeed, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards a lot: SMS and emails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible via HTML browsers, albeit traversing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">The price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, about 1400 euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">The smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>

<seg id="6">In a blogger post, the spokesman for Adblock Ben Williams wrote that "this kind of Hin-and-Her battle between the alluring open source community and the bypassing has been underway since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably inhabitable according to the projections of a new NASA Air model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus through tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could have had erdsimilar conditions.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that the Venus could have had a thin, erdgy atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also lit the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably had more dry areas than de Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to house life and protected against rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of Venus exponentially increases its day-length of the sun for almost two months," "" "stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Comio in a press release." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the sun's heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus, which is similar to evolution previously assumed by planetary researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was blown away by ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As its Hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide returned with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus that we know today.</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars in the star cluster rotate in different rates and in what context the rotation periods are associated with the formation of planets.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other star enhancements, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="5">The star cluster of the Pleiades is 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">Many stars in this cluster of stars, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood.</seg>

<seg id="1">Olympia 2016: chen Xinyi, Silwia Danekova and Adrian Richter are first doping cases</seg>
<seg id="2">Caught: because of a positive doping test, weightlifter Adrian aims not to start from Poland in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are overshadowed by the first official doping incidents.</seg>
<seg id="4">A caught athlete would have won almost a medal.</seg>
<seg id="5">Before the seventh race day, the first official doping cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Chinese swimmers Chen Xinyi, 3000 meter obstacle runner Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and the Polish weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately prior to the beginning of the already critically acclaimed athletics competitions these news came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="7">In Chen, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was proven last Sunday, which is used as a masked agent for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">On Friday afternoon, the International Sports Court (CAS) confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old had reserved the fourth place in the final over 100 m Butterfly, only 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have to take part in the courses over 50 m of freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) applied for the opening of the B-trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">The national association takes the matter "very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations," said Xinhua from a message: "we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the judgment."</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, IOC is no longer responsible, but CAS is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also at night from Rio the news spread about the positive sample at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "she said," "" "An unbelievable shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "she is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "said the female athlete." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said that the forbidden substance is the blood doping agent EPO.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended for the time being, according to BNT the B sample should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgaria's Prime Minister Boyko Borisov immediately reported speech to the athlete.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes don't draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation must not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday, the case "Adrian Target inski" was also known, the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively like his brother Tomasz three days earlier on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both deny the intake, however, both of them must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before the start of the athletes, the case of Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The World Association IAAF has banned the entire Russian team from the start to an exception because of systematic doping, including the native country of Kenya producing many bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the previous merging in China caused violent confrontations between athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt took the Chinese Olympic champion, Sun Yang, harshly.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt lila."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium over 200 m of freestyle, I want to hand over," "" "Lacourt said in the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of a debate with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">In 2014, Sun was positively tested with the stimulant trimetazidin in Chinese nationals, but only had to sit on a three-month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackmail hackers her ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "" "" "programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and they are successful." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey by the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany 40 percent of surveyed companies over the past twelve months have been at least once, sometimes repeatedly victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 per cent of the victims voluntarily paid the ransom salaries required by the perpetrators to reuse the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">According to the observations by Malwarebytes, the perpetrators specifically specialize in attacks in corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially formidable ransom is significantly higher than in private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008 most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the offenders discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was very fast in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files as well as on archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">In order to get the encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptoproung Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">But where private users have the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without having to shut down production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware falls.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 per cent of the German companies reported sales losses through ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operations, in one case people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only promote the problem," "" "explains Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the demands of the perpetrators in the face of stalemate in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the security researchers of F-Secure investigated the user interfaces and contact with the blackmailers and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain to their victims by chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites, or decrypt free example files.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are saved after payment of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums to retrieve their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">In view of the potentially high and relatively risk-free wins from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that it is about three or four people.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software toolkit to the actual blackmailers.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits so far have been created by purchasing the malware itself, consulting and additional tools for a one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "included is an adjustment tool so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," "" "says Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmail then searches for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is made per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "" "" "usually the criminals monitor spammers with spreading," "" "explains Wisniewski." ""</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">More than 50 percent of the IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey hope to be able to ward off ransomware by file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Consequently, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful edification, the offenders threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">As a result, the potential for damage is much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators will also be able to take completely new targets on the internet of things.</seg>
<seg id="43">At the Hackerkonferenz Defcon, security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of the winter, the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the offenders then instead of heating in the future block a whole production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>

<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the HR-V is only 1.60 m high, the passengers have plenty of room both in the front row and in the rear, it doesn't work in any place.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit top is falling apart.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like a cinema chair and thus offer storage space, which is 1.24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The luggage compartment can be loaded well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp gives the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">However, he is likely to make his work a little quieter.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gratifying.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">Four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">Driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">The steering is expected to be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the tested top variant" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the city emergency braking assistant (operates up to 32 km / h), the collision warning system and the lane keeping assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warner sometimes irritates because he judges many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "" "when maneuvering." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic signs detection and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">The full connectivity, however, is only available for the top equipment: 7-inch touch screen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI socket lie under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">The approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who don't want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 20000 euros, the diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips against sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one walks around eternally, at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is not possible to think of sleep far before the alarm-ringing.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten percent find their sleep frequently or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems manifest themselves?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and there are many causes behind them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeks, member of the German Society of Sleeping Beauty and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What one sees in the country is, however, the Insomnia, i.e. an entry and diarrhea disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Straight through sleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, board member of the German house medical association with practice in Varel, Lower Saxony.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">There may be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also drugs.</seg>
<seg id="12">Not infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early awakening is most common in depression," "" "says Weber." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">For example, who has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts thinking about everyday problems and worries, shoot an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I use sleep disorders to become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor, tells Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment can look quite different: one is beaten, tired, sleepy, has trouble with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical discomfort such as stomach ache or headaches.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">Treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly a lowered sleep-physician in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the family doctor, tells Weeks.</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to the sleep lab, and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">For an investigation in the sleep lab, doctors suggest snoring with breathing replacements, in case of daily fatigue, insomnia, or if one does not find the cause of a failure disorder, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare yourself for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "just don't make a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After slimming you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose goggles, a chest strap and a sensor on the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling shows the sleeping-ends.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sleep for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">Shoot counts: regular sleeping and standing times, do not sleep too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not beneficial.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">Prosecution of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years was successful on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspects had committed several bags of bags and baggage.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 9.30 pm civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf Airport again recognised a gang known to police officers from past acts of theft.</seg>
<seg id="6">The two women and two men had committed several offences since the middle of July and had proceeded in a common, cooperative and particularly professional manner.</seg>
<seg id="7">The specialists of the criminal investigator 34 can provide evidence of the divines that had come to Germany for alleged offences to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="8">In total, they had a total of over 15,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="1">Old buildings, a few linden trees, in between still a rest cobblestone pavement: the Riga-Friedrichshain Street works at first sight, but the police are counting them to the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When you cross the road from the east to the west, you pass playgrounds, a fresher kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has sprayed" "" "ugly!" "" "on the facade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">In contrast to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartment rentals will be built here.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as known as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, is portrayed in recent weeks, however, preferably with burning cars." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, now the tenants have leases, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, the Berlin-based internal senator Henkel has spoken out several times for a police action against the project - the area called "no-go-zone" for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After having been cleared with 300 police officers on the ground floor on 22 June, the police patrol three weeks in official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew cars on the ground, locked parts of the street and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, building workers renovated the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal and a day later the police and construction workers went under the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the street is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others are chatting with prom.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Leftist violence is not the main concern of many local residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has three children here, are mostly driven by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">They share the care of increasing rents and gentrification with the inhabitants of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "it doesn't sound like a" "" "Kiez" "" "that mostly wanted police protection from the vandaliating left." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">The ditch that the Berlin Inner senator and the police between house occupants and their neighbours does not exist so clearly.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class quarter, which also today compared to the rest of the city a low average and high poverty-risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">Also house occupations and the living projects born out of it belong to the neighbourhood quite a long time: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them nearly the entire Mainz street quite close to the Rigaer.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been swept under a large police force in a real street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are partly occupied by the people they had occupied 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, the district has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and pollinators from all over the world in recent years: people from GDR times and former Hausoccupiers share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is reflected in the rent, which has risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen in bonded windows or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with paint bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other street was mentioned this year so often in conjunction with the words" "" "left-autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily impacted by crime: crimes like bodily injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offenders make property damage, which tends to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in a rented house next to the controversial 94, there can be no talk of insecurity.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for acts of violence, it is appealingly: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, they were not meant to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">The famous burning cars are no longer available in the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Riga Road - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was so important for her to get back the street: from the police, politics and the media, who suddenly stressed the sovereignty over the district in July.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away from them: by faceless new buildings in former construction gaps that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "this is ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well infected live here," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what shall we do if someone never hears?</seg>
<seg id="36">Frustration is on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for immigrants who are annoyed about color bombings: the house projects and the left-hand scene belong to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws near should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub quarter, can complain about noise.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons mentioned only with first names have asked not to be called by their proper name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is New Refugee Representative</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in matters of integration and organisation.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="4">Annika Deuschle has been the refugee officer for Urbach since July.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of administration for Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact partner for all actors: refugees, working groups, refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the eiving Wollmilchsau, which has a problem above all.</seg>
<seg id="8">In this way, some - less mocking than on the other hand - had deliberately aimed at the multitude of desired tasks - meaning that the administration wanted to write out the job.</seg>
<seg id="9">An administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, was sought.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not its central area, "says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent job for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "Regine told us that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are great and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees who have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodation must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the district office to the commune and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">So far, it is not possible to rely on private apartments, according to Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">That is why common apartments have to be intimidated as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, apprenticeships, school grounds, one-Euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be rounded or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "more places would be good," "" "Regine customer reports." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, perform non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "that is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a firm structure, say Deuschle and customer.</seg>
<seg id="37">People need to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So we need offers such as sports, local contacts and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So here also administration and volunteers jump.</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "" "" "they need to explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of the time, for example with language courses." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">If someone eventually creates the feeling that he can't help in Urbach, he can't work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"" "but there are problems," "" "tell customers honest," "" "people who do nothing at all." "" "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others." ""</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent incidents, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "Regine customer says quite clearly," "" "what some naive may call." "" "a residual risk could and may not exclude them." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the caregivers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also a topic among the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would make them complete.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine customer.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">Therefore main and honorary members have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that a new push in refugees and migrants could soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics abhors.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not yet arrived in Urbach, where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, this would relax the situation.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher have already been utilized to integrate the existing people in a reasonable manner.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently about 100 people, mainly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, one must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
