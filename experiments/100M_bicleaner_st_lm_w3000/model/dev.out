Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed will also be tackl@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and th@@ rows up Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
by the deal struck by Obama , the Iranian nuclear program has further wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship of the two .
in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans , held a controversial speech before the US Congress , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected it with reference to the election in Israel that was im@@ min@@ ent at that time .
in an emergency call , professor sum@@ mon@@ ed his girlfriend to have shot
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb talked with a somewhat c@@ itt@@ y voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was alive and probably excited , and he said the dead woman &apos;s family contacts could be found on the cell phone .
inside the house the officials found the cor@@ p@@ ses of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ sh and a hand@@ written note scri@@ bble on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Police Chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has eventually done the fatal emergency call afterwards .
until the end of the day , there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher .
students said that they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ sh died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses from both .
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavi@@ ors .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who lau@@ ded Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , told him that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a leave of health for health reasons and said he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not guarantee an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb can no longer answer .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs &apos;s lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ ane Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why the Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that he believes he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb grew up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he received his doctorate in education in spring .
one of the long @-@ time girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met by common friends .
she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was then the flock of women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all girls melt away when he was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sh were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but there was no document of marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ sh , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old .
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter .
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues .
Lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ sh when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail both played on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played together one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ sh was a nurse , who worked for different companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a B@@ ark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poor@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ sh Night at night 5th September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ica before a spar@@ se audience .
there was no sign that anything was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were at the clearing and j@@ oked with each other .
I mean , they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American native and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school .
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , about 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the congregation at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght ceremony .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students back , &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge .
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
associated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb has now said that Lamb had made an emergency call after having shot Schmidt and that in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ gh he called his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married .

Michael J. Fox jo@@ king over his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
&quot; &quot; &quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the ro@@ y@@ als , and I realize that the seat is empty next to me , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated c@@ row and an arm length of it to be with the Princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really good for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel film ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back in Time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon said his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will only ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the fr@@ inge of the meeting of ministers of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ soluble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the at@@ tainment of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 Survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys below , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course , it is still too early during the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts stress that at this time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , of which no one had only one state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ sider groups such as J@@ eb Bus@@ h@@ s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now realize Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and start letting their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current surveys that indicate that the Real Estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps popularity has turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two out of ten Republi@@ cans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa last week found that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters GO@@ P would be happy with dump as candidates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thri@@ lled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about dump ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next thing in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of republi@@ can voters say that they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans sees Tr@@ um@@ ps Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 per cent of Irish voters ten@@ ding to the Republi@@ cans believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number is considered in the nation &apos;s first electoral state , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans believe that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to perform effectively , and almost six out of 10 independent say that his tem@@ per didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they raise their money hat@@ s , Republi@@ can voters keep pumping for real .
if asked who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say four out of ten from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week that Tr@@ ump is the best bet .
this is a change since the time when four out of ten put their money on J@@ eb Bush at the end of July .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , a large number of GO@@ P elec@@ tors are showing Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign as plau@@ sible .
even if the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump takes almost everyone .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership , while anti @-@ tr@@ ump support is distributed to more than a dozen other Candi@@ dates .
but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is re@@ aping the majority support .
he has 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , ahead of J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally ahead of Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly set their votes .
of course much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never to change the mind .
46 per cent said that they leave the door open to move to other candidates .
nevertheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is strongest competition at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for dump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with dump on immigration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign called &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; from Mexico two months ago , was the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in the public discourse of 2016 .
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump remains critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
but after the new ABC / Post Survey of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say that they agree with dump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , it seems that Donald Tr@@ ump seems to do .
the fru@@ stration of the government climb@@ s to new high@@ s .
in the meantime , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially through their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days survey by ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider as someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three of four I@@ owa Republi@@ cans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hel@@ ically anno@@ yed . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ by@@ gone weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea Area .
in the street , a square meter of a flat roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is naturally limited , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter costs the most .
of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student book in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residen@@ ces , however , one of the price rises as Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the Real Estate service provider Angel &amp; Völ@@ kers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros nix - per square meter , well marked .
but good , who can afford it ...
inci@@ dentally : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
Champions League : Bavaria dream start thanks to the mill@@ er and id@@ ol@@ at@@ ry
double gate protection in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os of Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it went .
a confident pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
the world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Götz@@ e have embark@@ ed on a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; in the FC Bayern in the witch ha@@ vel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ dol hit ( 8@@ 9. ) deserves at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola wants to finally get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
at his 28th consecutive match in the Champions League , Müller received a generous support from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who made a flan@@ k of the champion &apos;s deliber@@ ate shot .
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m promised before the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word .
they showed a concentrated and dedicated imagination without shining .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the top class , among them notable clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also a stum@@ bling block in 2011 ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bav@@ arians , in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim .
they were cour@@ a@@ geous , but often too in@@ ventive in their offensive efforts .
the attacks were induced too often on the left side of Douglas Costa against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck from the right than his flan@@ k came out of the right half @-@ field in the left upper corner of the cake .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best occasions in half .
first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stur@@ mer Ide@@ ye Brown hit the Polish head @-@ ball ( 26 . ) .
then by taking a direct debit , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians went up to their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set needle @-@ stit@@ ches .
but on Tor@@ ah &apos;s Manuel Neu@@ er , he was reli@@ eved .
for example , when he ste@@ ered a shot of ide@@ ye about the l@@ atin ( 5@@ 6th ) .
before Neu@@ er Guardi@@ ola placed a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario Götz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , was sitting outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup hero only gave the green light after the final training , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said sports director Matthias Sam@@ pler : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
i@@ dol came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it all clear 13 minutes later , with El@@ f@@ meter Müller still put one on it .
before the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium .
after a smaller group of partly ver@@ m@@ um@@ med Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block evi@@ dently had provoked the followers of the host of Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces interven@@ ed and went out with bat@@ ons against the Munich followers .
at least a Bayern @-@ Fan was viol@@ ated from the stadium .
who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
who smo@@ kes , does not only damage the lung , but also to the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
good news : if we don &apos;t give up , the risk decreases rapidly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly higher risk of losing their teeth early .
this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of pre@@ mat@@ urely losing their teeth in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 @-@ Fa@@ che .
the scientists had observed over 23,@@ 300 participants .
main causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , emphas@@ ise the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore due to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk within a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Journal of Dental Research &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment fell back to the level of non @-@ qu@@ itting smoking , explained Dr. Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people need to convince people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , said instructor H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking reduces the lifetime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our knowledge , leads to good dental health up to the age of old .
in Germany more than 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years were affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E communicated with them .
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists encounter rem@@ n@@ ants of late anti@@ quity at Cologne Rhine banks
for the second time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne .
near the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always drawn up as a department of archae@@ ology for soil preservation .
in the third section of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists now find it .
from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century a church stood , Trier explained .
beside the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves was also discovered , which probably belonged to the church .

European Commission to propose new judgment in dispute over TT@@ IP
in order to vali@@ date the dispute over the planned Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ( TT@@ IP ) , the European Commission has proposed extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states are to be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function clearly corresponds to more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens can trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström , Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Swe@@ de proposed introducing the proposal as a European negotiating position to the Free Trade talks with the US . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German government announced its support .
TT@@ IP will create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings specifically envis@@ age that the EU states and the US jointly select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the EU , the US and third countries .
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
so far , the parties have agreed among themselves on arbit@@ rators , a possibility of obj@@ ection to their judgments did not exist .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months it became clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; commented Malm@@ ström . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , she wants to work towards an international investment court .
there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied .
the investor state arbit@@ ration demanding mainly by major corporations ( IS@@ DS ) is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , over which companies can je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze compensation of tax pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws , or en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act outlined the proposals of the European Commission as insufficient . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has been critic@@ ised above all that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
on the other hand , the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as great progress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered significant points in the reform that the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ral tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against restric@@ ting the economy of the economy by too many new rules .
this meant that especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged .
when the talks on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer valid .
delicate Folk of Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart that the in@@ timi@@ dating folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen .
the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells us on the basis of various places he always records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ti@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs .
where they originated and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens has proven to be a wonderfully creative person .
with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State &quot; smart composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk of the late Six@@ ties , but can drift into the sum@@ p@@ tuous opul@@ ent at any time .
&quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a failed series : each of the 50 states of the United States should be ob@@ s@@ essed .
but already in 2004 and in the proximity to the Rhine already &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and breaks positive expectations .
St@@ ev@@ ens can be reduced here .
live meet him guitar and ban@@ jo .
one year later , the musician living in New York returns to the series .
with &quot; Illinois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) , a nationwide master@@ work is published in 2005 .
overl@@ apping ideas and styli@@ stic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( 2010 ) to use very extensive electronic fragments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this sixth neat studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but carried by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b .
long since the smaller club desc@@ ended , the stage shows here become a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large lumin@@ escent stage de@@ co .
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is part of a five member band through Germany .
in the dark Hamburg city More !
&quot; &quot; &quot; the theatre shows mainly the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the St@@ ev@@ ens , which has become much more mature , returns to in@@ timacy and folk .
without judging a word to the audience , the group plays excellent musicians through the broad@@ ly enriched album .
you can hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can throw the &quot; disk away . &quot;
only to an en@@ core would St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly thanks St@@ ev@@ ens , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally deca@@ ys under thunder@@ ous applause .
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo
since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo has been eag@@ erly awa@@ ited
the new Labour president , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will make his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo hold and will be working with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to provide the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from close quarters .
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary review for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C meeting on Tuesday .
in the meantime , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to wait for a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence has provoked a criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs during a commem@@ oration ceremony at the celebration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesperson said he had stood in respect@@ ful silence , and he acknowledged the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told in the BBC Two news night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
nearly a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are referring to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent Robin Bran@@ t said that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within the Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Labour &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; statement to the European Union &apos;s position and the constra@@ int on profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation as a whole .
hours later Mr Smith , the shadow working and pen@@ sion@@ er minister , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds to 23@@ ,000 pounds .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since becoming a T@@ ory chief , over the last decade confron@@ ting the Dis@@ patch Box in parliament .
the Labour leader , who promised another policy approach , says that he has ideas on Mr Cameron &apos;s &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas and gave him more than 30.000 ideas .
the Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s cargo is too con@@ front , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; skill &quot; and the stri@@ kers with bar@@ b@@ arians , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , is represented if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally spoke the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House of House , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy Theatre &quot; which is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s cargo . but a few years later he admitted that he failed in it .
since it was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and his leadership under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms .

pound rises due to accelerated wage growth in the UK
the pound rose mark@@ edly by data showing an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid aim of SA@@ BM@@ iller .
between May and July , earnings in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and ear@@ thy estim@@ ations about the time of an increase in interest since 2009 .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after tak@@ eover bid received by the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
a transaction would combine the world &apos;s two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together .
according to encouraging news from the competition group , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher for the Rich@@ em@@ ont luxury goods market .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had taken $ 2.5 billion by a sale of stock as part of his strategy of reducing the debt .
the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his assessment of the company rating on &quot; selling . &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % after the sports@@ wear company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
the head of J@@ D Sports suggests that higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could mean more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs in his company , he says .
the cost could be the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on Bie@@ ber Expedition in Berlin
Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar .

the plat@@ inum @-@ bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
more even more .
currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 spins .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
not too bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
from 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone s@@ labs in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz .

&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in college . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
school obligation ?
who is it ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber itself is not .
it has already taken care of anyway .
for the advertisement in the promotional period of the supermarket he cas@@ c@@ aded three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company sp@@ elled many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account .
and with every doll that looks like he and above the counter goes , Bie@@ ber also cas@@ c@@ ates .
when Jus@@ tin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , you &apos;ll be amazed at the window screen .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e went too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; others stress that Bie@@ ber was finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at number 1 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os .
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Leban@@ ese to potato pe@@ er idea
potatoes or twe@@ et@@ ers ?
both - and indeed in the potato @-@ don@@ er , which the Ol@@ denburg I@@ mb@@ h owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y developed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ ha@@ y has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ öner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen by chance on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue sk@@ ewer is spinning in his shop , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is multic@@ ultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y .
in the meantime , the Leban@@ ese government has decided to put the idea into the patent office in Munich .
in this case , according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model .
as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ ha@@ y wants to betra@@ y it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
culinary international understanding is also popular among its customers .
Met@@ cash La@@ un@@ ches Continu@@ ity Camp@@ aig@@ n to Fi@@ ght Al@@ di@@ - In@@ dic@@ ate
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million dollar Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA markets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA shops and shop@@ keepers who sell che@@ ap@@ sed tickets for the South Australian Soccer League to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment conduc@@ ts its annual Investor strategy day .
there is much at stake since South Australia and Western Australia account for nearly 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in the eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that twelve months after the opening of its first markets , Al@@ di will cut off around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA individual dealers could lose 360 $ million sales per year and cash $ 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and achieve sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in food and food business and the amounts on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purchases are the most faithful .
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , 4.1 percent in 2017 , and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported that Met@@ cash will probably disappear within a decade .
Met@@ cash declined to publicly respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s , food and food trade , about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction on sales and margins at the same time .
the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to rep@@ licate retail prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths by hundreds of products each week and to improve I@@ GA individual retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and deliver a better selection of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s General Manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and re@@ charging programs to El@@ an are growing and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth in 2017 for the first time in four years .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the president of the Australian tennis court Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ z and ear@@ ns praise rather than criticism for his own behaviour according to the president of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the spotlight with the not@@ orious discussion of Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fi@@ ery qualification match in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati shortly afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , whereby Har@@ rison would have had to beat the Kyr@@ gy@@ z and I should beat the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a Kra@@ mp@@ f caught a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing about which I am quite en@@ vious is the fact that , after my view , Th@@ an@@ asi was pulled into the quar@@ rel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a bat when he lost due to a var@@ ic@@ ose in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he is not proud of it .
but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strict .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is good in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ gy@@ nes on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team as a long @-@ term firm component . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at first , we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think Nick was very quick to get out of what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he climb@@ s in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary states emergency , closing the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency and ri@@ gged the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants arrested in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and Serbian officials re@@ acted with ou@@ trage .
the people who fled from violence stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations rose .
when a police helicopter ho@@ ver@@ ed over them , the migrants cried out &quot; Open the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force .
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister stated that it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that migrants would be sent back from Hungary , while more and more will arrive from Macedonia and Greece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; talks with Brussels and other countries must take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vi@@ ca D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended one day after the 28 @-@ nation blo@@ c at a meeting in Brussels which failed to agree a common immigration policy .
however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the troubled Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would receive another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary , in the next month or until the end of the year .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swift action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the emergency stand , which was opened on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures .
the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having completed a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed at the race to create bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months , Hungary has become a substantial bott@@ len@@ eck and entry point into the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most arriving economic refugees are looking for a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that stands strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws which entered into force at midnight in Hungary make crossing the border or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher prison sentences for condemned traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation arising from mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the deployment of the military , which will be expected next week , but repor@@ ters from Associated Press have already seen heavy armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , Country Security Ad@@ visor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities caught 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damage the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of crimes committed in accordance with the new laws .
authorities are trying to repair the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders had arrived .
chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to get there .
about 20 managed to enter , but thousands were outside .
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to enter Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for nom@@ ination at the national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against the ground .
Clinton has now supported 47 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders are second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) .
vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presidential office , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries .
more than five months before the elections begin , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is determined by what candidate they will support .
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders scored a number of profits .
Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among men has fallen sharply , and S@@ anders only return with 5 points .
Clinton &apos;s advantage over 50 years of democratic voters has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
Clinton has yet a big advantage over the older voters .
last month Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group .
about half of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are saying that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger mixed with those currently not supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time for a woman president to be ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the elec@@ torate are also cited .
as the Vice @-@ President casts a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although one third believes he should not do it .
if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to run for the democr@@ ats nom@@ ination , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advantage is increased , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 per cent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ den is by far a second at this measurement , but the percentage that sees him as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; selectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , with the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
similarly , as in the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for the voters of the prim@@ aries emerged as unacceptable .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important tra@@ its among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
maj@@ orities Main@@ tain Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den scores the best among the three candidates in hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of the democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him .
democratic voters in general elections generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views .
for all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic vot@@ er has no opinion of S@@ anders .
since questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server continue to be placed as Minister of Foreign Affairs during the term of office , most demo@@ cra@@ cies are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions overall .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion has still wor@@ sen@@ ed .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton .
although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the constitu@@ ents of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not stand for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of those entitled to vote look nationwide also Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good guidance as well .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush perform hon@@ esty best .
a majority regards it rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many do not have an opinion of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election is 6 percentage points . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ben Car@@ son moves near Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
the two candidates now have half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others will lose a lot of support .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support country @-@ wide tr@@ ump in large numbers . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS @-@ survey conducted before Fox News Deb@@ ate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son fired up from 6 % to 23 % during the same period .
the survey also showed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump under Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked down with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who has fallen down at the deepest level , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio resi@@ des in third place with 6 % .
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people by Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l announced last week shows that Car@@ son is rising in the surveys - he lands at 19 % support among the Republi@@ cans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support .
the latest survey conducted by ABC News / Washington Post showed also dr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
with a view to a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ surgeon even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to ques@@ tioning Tr@@ um@@ ps faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bath temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
even though peak values can only be measured in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people no longer go into the sea : the water in the north and the Baltic Sea has a maximum of 18 degrees this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares .
bath temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it even reaches up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five Brotherhood members bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch college new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died in a student relationship in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons were submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Bru@@ derschaft attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ceremony in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police announced .
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and was repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained of head@@ aches , then he fell un@@ conscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call on the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gle his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , Police Chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and basically put the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood on that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Chief Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g was repeatedly inj@@ ected with bl@@ unt strength injuries to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; too many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died in the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ roe recommended an indictment for murder third grade for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indic@@ ted for illegal attacks and the formation of a criminal union .
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ officially - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday .
Bar@@ uch College banned the Brotherhood , and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked its membership to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest comes , and the land@@ se gets tan@@ gled , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the procedure .
a recession came within only 11 months of the first interest rate increase and lasted 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , al@@ beit not always , a factor in how the economy and the financial systems react .
therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have emphasized so v@@ ehem@@ ently that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period needed for normal@@ isation .
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , however , market participants could find that all the excitement could possibly be over@@ done because of an increase in interest rates .
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , head econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal high places , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
this does not mean , however , that there will be no impact .
here is a picture based on historical trends as some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things more volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment occurs , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there seems to be a tendency that fortune yields will be dis@@ regarded 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years has mostly been in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the road to interest rate , rather flat in the 250 days after 500 days , with an average yield over the past six last cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which Bob D@@ oll , boss facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the increase cycle and the rate of return begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions which it did not have before and which could accelerate a recession .
it is not@@ e@@ worthy that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the F@@ ed interest rate increase .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases were only twice the nominal GDP at 4.5 percent since 1950 .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic setting could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market players have taken the whole year on an increase in interest of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trade shows only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ers very quickly put forward after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this is 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to that of the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than for shares , if they change their strategic direction .
bonds seem to change direction once the first increase / decrease occurs in the cycle .
at the end of the increase cycle the bond @-@ endi@@ ces immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in the interest rates will lead to returns between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is interesting is that Jones believes that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; apart from the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is flat , lending margins have increased and volati@@ lity continues - all the tra@@ its of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy .
in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their operations in the United States will benefit if interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational companies with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react extremely positively three months after an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with a strong balance sheet , companies with weak balance sheet ranked by 5 percentage points on average after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital returns , as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares , also exceeded their low @-@ quality counter@@ parts by an average of 0.4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a big problem .
companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose the most , Gold@@ man said .
outside the pure stock games consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative Party of Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ ca@@ ster for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cur@@ v@@ ature &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ish@@ able from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards and said they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice and said that this was not very original .
BBC Radio 3 is &quot; walking &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading member of the parliament and raises new pressure to the broad@@ ca@@ ster to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also told BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also pointed to the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name .
so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said .
BBC Director General rec@@ alled the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and educ@@ ating the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I will never learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and to put new works on commission , I consider it important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that harder it would be to work harder than it did in the past because the British are less informed about classical music .
however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which came under fire during the hearing in the Committee for the Sel@@ ection of Culture , Media and Sport to stand on the feet of commercial ri@@ vals .
the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins attacked The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated £ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in special BBC manner &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he added that he wishes that the company &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; when the next time it started a series of entertainment .
however , it refused to exclude the order from other ranks of The Voice in the future , or to give money to the fee pay@@ ers for other entertainment formats .
net sales increased in August at slow@@ est pace and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month there was the lowest result since the beginning of records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed up expendi@@ tures in November
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has bo@@ oted , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
but experts say that now there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
total expenditure for August presented the lowest growth in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , this has always evolved over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales company , the Guardian .
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now that is comm@@ uting , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing .
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing revenues .
experts believe that purch@@ as@@ ers will hold back their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers gathered around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , on which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that out of £ 5 expenditure was spent a little more than £ 1 online .
in some products such as TV and washing machines , more than a third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of the fashi@@ ons in the inner cities .
Muslims bury the people who killed in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funer@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the roads
Saudi Arabia de@@ poses the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead who were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que .
mo@@ urn , dressed largely in white , the route to pay their respect , when the first of the dead approached their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the proc@@ ession passes by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane came through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then fell on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king handed down a sanc@@ tion over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane pl@@ ung@@ ed through the Great Central Committee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage when the crane fell down .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ ess in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already stated that the H@@ add@@ lers will go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands who continue to come to the city .
today King Sal@@ man said that the Bin Laden group would not have been able to steal the arm of the crane when it was not used .
an Arabic version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the leadership of the company was forbidden to travel abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man promised to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that rus@@ hed into an inner courtyard of the big mos@@ que where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ an , who later takes place this month .
the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the breakdown of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ jour@@ ned the group because of non @-@ current security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s big mos@@ que as part of the massive building project , which is managed by the Bin Laden group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the ruling family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s .
the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage that is required at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials announced that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded receive half of this amount .

British occupy increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has sur@@ ged
this will lead to the opening of 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops target@@ ing craftsmen .

it is claimed that Brit@@ ons put down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European handic@@ ra@@ fts@@ men who carry out work in their home
if you can use a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays .
the British are increasingly employing craftsmen to perform DIY jobs in their homes , according to the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V@@ é@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new CEO of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now out@@ dated .
therefore , King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shops dedicated to tra@@ des@@ people and close 60 sales points of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchase decisions were made by women .
at the moment , men out@@ weigh men .
she said it was necessary to meet the growing demographic trends that show more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must move this stronger towards a balance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a matter of principle , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in executive positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and CFO .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety here is an important topic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decrease in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group ap@@ ologi@@ zed for closing the shops .
because of the trends King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
officials from A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of un@@ faith@@ fulness to court
on Wednesday two function@@ aries of Austrian volleyball vice @-@ president A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to answer for lack of fi@@ del@@ ity and gradu@@ ation .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he has been acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary examination , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the preliminary investigation that the def@@ end@@ ants in the years 2006 to 2011 were mon@@ ies of club accounts , which they were allowed to disp@@ ose in their functions for private purposes .
the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros .
sports officials are also accused of financial failures .
this fact was expressed by the Chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ oting Council , Ju@@ dge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
in rej@@ ecting the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no time an asset has been created for the association .
sports officials were only charged for compensation and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , out of the debt - the pas@@ si@@ va amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ illing ( RD . 4@@ 4.000 ) in 2001 .
&quot; at the time , we faced the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? , &quot; one of the def@@ end@@ ants told , in the bread@@ cr@@ ust of large @-@ scale audi@@ tors of the financial department .
with his colleagues and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants , he then decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have advanced money , laid down our life insurance as security at the bench , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed on : you can manage the money freely , it is not allowed to make any debt .
furthermore , with appropriate financial success , the payout of the expense allowance had been decided retro@@ spec@@ tively by 1991 .
therefore one part of the expense allowance was paid only years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus had been on the account .
therefore , l@@ ump @-@ sum and not detailed bookings appeared , the former chairman explained the proceedings .
the accounts and accounts opened the two def@@ end@@ ants together , the second accused .
why withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail to the association , the judge asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association did not care in detail for financial fraud , important is the freedom of debt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when in 2011 an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the club account against the one function@@ ary investig@@ ator because of abuse of office .
these were set@@ backs , the def@@ end@@ ants declared .
this securities account ran on the name of the second accused and was not known to the association according to his statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said he had believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of that money , the prosec@@ utor sur@@ rendered to the room .
the co @-@ def@@ end@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims compensation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted judge and prosec@@ utor to know .
wher@@ eu@@ pon the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association never had any damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are all from the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
furthermore , the function@@ ary said that he never paid a cent &apos;s salary , he just paid o@@ dom@@ eter money and di@@ ets .
he charged 1000 Euro per month at di@@ ets , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added .
the def@@ end@@ ants could not present accurate records for the early years .
they were no longer kept after an audit of the company , in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
o@@ dom@@ eter money was also related to the second accused .
all corrections were made in cash , for which he had to drive from his hom@@ etown international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard provides more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to the workforce reduction for three years , the computer will be demoli@@ shed further jobs when the company spl@@ its up .
there is no end to the US @-@ Compu@@ te Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) sub@@ missions .
as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to cut 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate segment .
this means that costs amounting to EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter .
the mining of 5@@ 5.000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years .
at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP had a workforce of roughly 30@@ 2,000 associates .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard &apos;s share yiel@@ ded 2.3 percent .
the company from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , a company with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : this is how the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led once again in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after his services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo last .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues thus declined in 15 from 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions to the shift in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently responded to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and always do more business online .
Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age a total reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
a direct participation of German soldiers in hos@@ tili@@ ties in Iraq , however , would mainly be rejected : 54 per cent spoke against it , 35 percent pointed to the agreement .
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria is 61 percent positive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 24 per cent are opposed to intervene in the conflict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a collaboration with the Syrian authorities of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad would reject 51 percent of the respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be .
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
the focus will be on connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars and e @-@ mobility until 27 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mobility Pi@@ ece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
as two years ago , the organis@@ ers of the V@@ DA Car Association expect about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : outbreak of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed several hundred refugees on the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water@@ th@@ row@@ ers .
Eur@@ on@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed violent erup@@ tion at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line was formed and behind the polic@@ emen , a water@@ th@@ row@@ er was ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially stopped pepper spray .
then the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
in this way the group was dissolved .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees have now withdrawn something . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a pregnant and apparently injured wife was removed from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees sag@@ ged in themselves and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the Ser@@ b police spokes@@ men also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of deciding on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank conven@@ es on two days , Wednesday and Thursday to make the important decision whether interest has been raised for almost a decade or not .
a survey of 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the view was that the F@@ ed will do so , now think that the F@@ ed will remain a bit longer and the interest rates will last from 0 @-@ 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest paid to NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , Chief Executive Officer at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics .
the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lions of dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global circumstances .
she warned the markets to adapt to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CE@@ T on Thursday
death protective at the Delta State University left ap@@ ologi@@ ze
after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot and killed his colleagues , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; sorry &quot; at the first murder and wanted to &quot; make it happen , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer for ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; and he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He has shot at someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb told the staff of the emergency department that the police had to send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he will probably be upset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the call@@ ers for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb had no explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman I ever loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after writing the note Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor for history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite reports on Monday that Lamb supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ were also had a relationship with Schmidt , the authorities told on Tuesday that there was &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that they had been married about seven years , as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good man &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but were friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ sh would have a daughter who is 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed on the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss was their daughter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely best friends &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ sh worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , joined Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les
the police said Lamb had inv@@ oked relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them that &quot; he was not going to prison . &quot;
when polic@@ emen catch him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb was awarded a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , as his way of life is on the university &apos;s website .

Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large group conversion .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros a year with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s roughly 1,000 leaders will cost the corporate restructuring the workplace .
however , with the pilot union there are new negotiations .
Lufthansa is building up its corporate structure and evalu@@ ates Eu@@ rov@@ ings cheaper .
the target of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around € 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , announced the airline on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa Cargo is not responsible for the passenger &apos;s business in the future .
the cheap airline Eu@@ rov@@ ings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the future , the board team headed by Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r will be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ning &apos;s Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt .
with the new order , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ scores the importance of Eu@@ rov@@ ings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet .
to date , the organization of the 120@@ ,000 employee was complex .
the airline operated under the roof of the airline Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of € 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
the negotiations after the j@@ ammed strike on this Thursday are to be resum@@ ed in the Coll@@ ective Agreement with the Pilot Plan@@ e of the cockpit ( VC ) .
this divided the union .
the topic of talks should be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in one year , the cockpit wanted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to achieve predictable results as soon as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and airline in recent months led to various strikes .
in addition to the interim supplies of the drivers , the background is &quot; Wings . &quot;
in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa fores@@ ees routes to the Group &apos;s own budget line Eu@@ rov@@ ings .

Manchester United will not play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered from Manchester &apos;s Champions League defeat at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven a double frac@@ ture of his right leg .
while this brought the left outside def@@ enders to cry and closing it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al is not hoping that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was introduced into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be moved tomorrow or maybe one day later and then worked in Manchester .
it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has very hard and then plays fantastic , and then happens .
in the dressing room he had a oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it lasts six months and it will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished the Mexican .
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card are due .
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ w &apos;s account was : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery is beginning now , I &apos;ll come back again . &quot;
referring to this : Manchester United has suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w at the PS@@ V defeat
the UK Defender has an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming of June .
Phil@@ lip Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V coach , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a night@@ fall when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al &apos;s Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very difficult because it was not his intention to hurt the enemy , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury it &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents will learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax decided to pay Dr. Se@@ uss &apos;s eco @-@ label , which was published in 1971 .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
everything nice and good except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron allegedly describes the story of the book , instead returns an ingredient of the 2012 film version that added new characters and details to extend the fairly brief original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage was and who died in 1991 , but completely unknown .
as if this is not yet suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly reading the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the Internet Movie Database website and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he admitted to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , a so @-@ called boy , like the local environment , sounds frustr@@ ated by the gre@@ edy , trees precip@@ it@@ ating , Th@@ need stri@@ ck@@ ling Once @-@ ler , &quot; which speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; is rav@@ aged .
most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who has not read The Lor@@ ax a child twenty times consec@@ u@@ tively .
a Dow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no other immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
coming to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England selected for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ wards victory .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks Chess Page may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful @-@ positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ e@@ Ali &apos;s spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown size at test level , is an option for the attack .
referring to this news : Adam Ly@@ t reti@@ res from the England test cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is of course difficult for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are geared to results .
there were no question marks with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I said this before - players are their own best sel@@ ections .
long ago one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully kno@@ cks out more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there &apos;s another chance .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team @-@ man .
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his mark is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick was given nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out@@ ward .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer that I highly in@@ timi@@ date .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which we met very much .
he must have at least the same chances as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea to leave Mo@@ een next to Cook , which would perform an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I have nothing against it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and he has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference .
my former te@@ amm@@ ate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he immediately made three hundred re@@ uns and didn &apos;t look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited deal@@ ings with him he has impressed me as a young man .
people may see his stat@@ s - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the team , England has made some smart additions to the coaching station .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test matches could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game that will bring a wealth of experiences , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment into the setup .
I always felt he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used for the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot got a similar break to Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not specify the schedule .
and you need to remember that as with players , their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain momentum if the economy continued to operate until 2017 .
David Cameron &apos;s un@@ expressed ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation strategy to keep Britain in the EU is going deeper every day , even without the election of the brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought severely because of Europe on Tuesday .
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
a European diplom@@ at , recently said that some member states , deeply ent@@ an@@ gled in various crises , as the EU is now and not always from their own fault , Britain himself created agenda with split conc@@ essions and disrup@@ tive treaty changes that they often do not want , are satisfied .
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it , if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , who wishes to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point in some capitals where it doesn &apos;t matter if we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as it happened in the exagger@@ ated long @-@ term har@@ ps like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ ter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
French François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
it is also an enfor@@ ce@@ able force .
Poland might soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is hard to imagine that they will break a leg in order to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , quite in the SN@@ P style , while Great Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n who supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they may be weak@@ ly reminiscent of Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who made a name for himself as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
in all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , telephone h@@ ack@@ ering foreigners and the pseu@@ do non @-@ nation@@ alities most of our major newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar to her but made sure that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you better spread ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had put the principle on the un@@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened a backdoor .
the press has never forgiven him .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly flap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he no longer needed time for me - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s , an error back then and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in the development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int trend and wild feelings of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ England can say yes to everyone .
it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s appointment of the pro@@ voc@@ ative John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as a shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; under all circumstances &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their conference on Monday evening .
whatever the be@@ aut@@ y@@ ful bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the era of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is correct to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe , which allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins surely thinks like that .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities for EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities for Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is sure that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to leave - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British , if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , what I was reminded of at the start on Monday of something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was calling .
experts critici@@ ze Public Health Report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking arose from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to the tobacco industry , said researchers .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have challenged the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; build on stone or sand &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were conven@@ ed to develop a model for a multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Decision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to give their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the outcome of the meeting was summari@@ zed in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose CEO had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Monitoring ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive after reports previously by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added .
the reasons for selecting the members of the board are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include domain financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their expertise in tobacco control .
the tobacco management of P@@ he took part in the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products on most criteria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; premature . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at P@@ he , said that he had already re@@ acted to the claims of BM@@ J .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has the unique duty to inform the public about what evidence shows and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nearly 8@@ 0,000 people die annually on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
due to the clear presentation of recent evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ enders , says former boss of Channel 4
the former president of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson said that the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ enders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the broadcast cost should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK @-@ channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for expos@@ ing publicly @-@ legal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in hard controversial tim@@ ings against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC Director General , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he had tried for six years in Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broadcast , which would also be clearly shown by non subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus communication committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcast costs , which I consider medium or long @-@ term not for a good idea , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not make or commission .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is financing programs that could be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ poin@@ ter is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
to be honest , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think it would ever l@@ essen the BBC .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series , who managed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to ensure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular shows are what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggest@@ ing that the BBC should sell shows like East@@ enders .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal &quot; niche programs &quot; should go to BB@@ C4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they can argue if they go to their hypo@@ critical missions for justi@@ fying € 4 billion broadcast fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window where no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , you all think , we all think that you get a great value here for £ 150 a year , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , I wonder if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday called for the BBC to check , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inform , educ@@ ate , and maintain their eth@@ ici@@ an mission . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that only a few of BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example on the public broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada to &quot; inform , clarify and conver@@ se . &quot;
on the question of partnerships , El@@ stein argued that the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and deal with commercial channels to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change direction in the moment when they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses , which have too high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard .
the impulses work by switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultras@@ onic waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms revealed the power of a new process called son@@ o@@ genetics , where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that triggers electric impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms typically do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they were doing it if they were surrounded by a fluid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells to which they are assigned , such a report Nature Communications .
to create ultrasound @-@ controlled n@@ em@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani changed the worms so that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when applying ultrasound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the changed motor @-@ tones .
the procedure has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics may have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent to the desired location in the brain by optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus are able to temporarily make the targeted human neur@@ ons vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani .
other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that reigned for the Ar@@ ms Trade Fair - through a laying of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; let us give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic tw@@ o@@ fold company advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; through blu@@ stering with bright colors and animation it stays stronger . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

what we need now is an invasion of the British government and the guarantee that torture instruments are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most I have learned can be distill@@ ed into eight simple rules .
the entrance in student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly irrit@@ ating to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell where you are coming from , where and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ane , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you hon@@ estly do not love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like , unlike those you would not talk to , even if your lashes were on fire and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers would be .
let people leave .
people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , film night event locations and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear themselves and wear their under@@ wear .
referring to this : don &apos;t remember to start a relationship with a university
intro@@ vert receives a crude treatment at the university .
her room should be a refuge , but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space b@@ um culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to continue , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for the interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow student of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
as you start the university at the peak of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have made you something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates are committed to enter@@ tain yourself and eventually will associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps made from flour , sugar and fat make people sleeping when you kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea as well ?
check this with the milk owner .
chances are good that they say to use themselves even if they cook inside .
if someone ste@@ als your bel@@ ong@@ ings , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my fellow @-@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise , the people stop from sleep or from work .
it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
a girl in my hall asked her neighbors , if it makes something to them , drum &amp; bass a little qui@@ eter than three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left off their own music , shut off their door and went to their three @-@ hour exam .
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would accidentally move in to the same residence ?
conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be pro@@ found@@ ly embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , take care of her , take care of her and then see her every day and perhaps witness how she moves together all common friends .
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your abdom@@ en a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems .
a good stroke is funny , but it only takes moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on safety - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and put your keys in a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not stap@@ le their possessions on the ceiling more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ income workers
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner relies on mid @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian corner @-@ terra@@ ced houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so for example , for refugees , but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need living space , but also the single mother and the low @-@ wage ear@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good buildings today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees are displaced to the housing market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner thinks to know how quickly affordable housing can be created : it builds in a project row houses for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay here for a great deal .
in view of the flow of refugees , we need enough housing in the next few decades .
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution .
Gil@@ lis : a row house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different when people are accommod@@ ated in blocks of flats .
each of the six homes currently built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it can be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
then the houses can be easily reconstructed according to their needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ lis : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without land .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
have building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ lis : legally , I have correctly passed my project .
especially complicated makes it always the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the regulation regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three plots .
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ lis : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ lis : it &apos;s true : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but built in luxury apartments that can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even the normal people need living space .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple Update is released
&quot; &quot; &quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the recruitment app , typing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it is ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install .
some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message telling me that the &quot; software update is failing . &quot;
to circum@@ vent the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or try to update via iTunes .
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
this may mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made this impro@@ b@@ able by stream@@ lining the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them once the process has been completed .
it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or located near a charger , so that the battery is charged .
if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might turn off half@@ way and this could lead to an interruption of the update .

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only a motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team @-@ mate Lewis Hamilton only a motto : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the World Cup second stressed before the start into the decisive seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have nothing to lose . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
53 points separate the Vice World Champion before reti@@ ring in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and double champion Hamilton .
the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve consecutive races of the season and takes the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite in attack .
in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race .
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have an influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .

bad Kis@@ singer Chess Club has a prominent member
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which was founded three months ago has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new member is entrepren@@ eur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the bearer of the Federal Cross of Mer@@ it 1st Class and Hon@@ orary Ci@@ tizen of the towns of Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which pres@@ ided over Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record chess players who cannot raise the membership fee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent discovery should also be promoted further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town . &quot; &quot; &quot;
district Agency looks for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the elderly centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces under the coat of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
in addition to consultations , it is also possible to participate in courses .
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain into the city centre .
more precisely , the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened .
from now on , right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seek@@ ers receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or health care services .
for years , with our out@@ patient care service , we have been finding that often caring relatives are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , many health services are not in@@ frequently used because the complexity of insur@@ ers is hardly understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new landlord J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and ci@@ vic hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat .
therefore you can use additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment .
the offers from the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; Heike R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis said .
both executives will see the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre especially in demographic change .
this requires a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure in the individual parts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inauguration celebrations , dedicated the district office to the lon@@ el@@ iness of old age : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and they invite you to a regular soci@@ able get @-@ together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the social foundation makes a major contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live independently and efficiently in their familiar environment .
the lod@@ g@@ ings office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 am to 2 pm , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and on Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 pm .

according to his own statement , he wants to have added 30 kilogram of muscle mass over the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not add intellec@@ tually .

as a result , Wiese fell out of the shop , insul@@ ted the police and threw her the possible fine before the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reports .
in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations that the consequences for the unusual incident are not yet clear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the thing is still in the test &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; it is said of the city of Bremen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
only after that will be decided whether meadow will be shown or not .

men examine 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were walking on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster .
one from the group , a sev@@ ent@@ een @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft @-@ gas station .
there were also three persons on the site of the gas station .
one of these men then scre@@ amed the young man and hit him with his fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al frac@@ ture and bleeding heavily from the nose .
when his two friends ha@@ st@@ ened and persu@@ aded the ra@@ cket , he left his victim at first .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car up to their home and demonstr@@ atively drove past there demonstr@@ atively .
when you didn &apos;t see the car any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male figure .
the victim &apos;s face and thi@@ ghs were beaten with the aid of a dr@@ um@@ stick .
the injured had to be hospit@@ alized for medical treatment .
so far only a vag@@ ue tat@@ too description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters tall .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 meters tall and was dressed with a je@@ ans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of rock breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ and and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fre@@ er@@ ausen .
the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ ul are also happy about this .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : on October 1 , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of rock breaks .
while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on his side in the next few months .
after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the office again on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was sympathy at first sight when Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ fer , met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ in , who currently completed their training at the Ver@@ dener hospital and who will also join the practice this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the mill@@ ers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fo@@ er@@ ausen and laugh@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was time I just called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to pursue its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future was pleased with the couple Müller .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mill@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he also sees himself being his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the mill@@ ers bought the house with the practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
his two @-@ time father , Frank Müller , grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hannover in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen . in 2009 , he was appointed Chief Medical Officer in Di@@ ep@@ holz county in 2009 and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ prepar@@ edness of breaking hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen on a voluntary basis .
from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss .
during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ den@@ hausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ ni@@ tin ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the Müll@@ ers , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as hous@@ eholders .
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ in .
after the conversion the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load EC@@ Gs and need a talk @-@ room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
the mill@@ ers receive a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 Euros as part of a subsi@@ dy programme from the administrative district ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and joyful we are that practice is continued , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Sam@@ son &apos;s mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come to the field of rock breaks each quarter , in the North German average practice there are about 500 .
there is another house doctor &apos;s practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice transfer by Frank Müller : according to Ur@@ sel , the pharmacy remains in A@@ sen@@ dorf , according to Ur@@ sel .
if no successor was found , it would have gone too .
those who visit Müll@@ ers &apos; consultation hour also still look in familiar faces : the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms are taken over .
with their f@@ arewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel , Fel@@ ien , re@@ members .
after a long time , she felt a little melanch@@ oly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ ni@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband compl@@ ements , laugh@@ ing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6000 square meter property . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;ve always pressed before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also raised at our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border stay parallel to that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to submit asylum can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it is also clear that there are clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people need to know that we do not accept unlimited flows of migration , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border .
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that also Slovenia would allow arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and could also establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister for Home Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not see that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already severely checked as the border limit of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia does not want to shut down its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the Croatian government , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours of Tuesday to enter eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration .
the Croatian police picked them up in the near ma@@ ize fields .
according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has been constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees .
it is mainly Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days his country reck@@ ons with around 4000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , from Pres@@ evo to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had so far brought migrants to the Hungarian border , led to Croatia , Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the Belgrade government denied that it was it that people are att@@ acking certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id in the morning , but in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the occup@@ ants were on the way all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was around 500 kilometres away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has done , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could actually come to a somewhat further west @-@ west route for the predicted shift of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic had previously pointed out that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not call details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extensive possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out rigor@@ ous checks to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , since then , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country , as far as the standard of border controls is concerned .
on Serbian side , about 300 refugees continue to be stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the reports of the media reports , they spent the past night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g continue to be completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees now want to go on to the Croatian border is still unclear .
the Serbian Minister of the Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , tried to calm Wednesday morning at a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he regards the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is closed now , for premature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it would not currently deal with very high refugee figures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey across Hungary , Croatia or any other country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
however , private Hungarian refugees have already started distributing country maps on which alternative routes are drawn up by Croatia .
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields 20 years after the end of the Croatian war .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .

the lower level of view comes in spite of the price increases which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent on average and effective on January 4 and despite higher rainf@@ all for shipment of heavy and large packages , which will be raised in November .
the company said that the result was nonetheless expected to increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenues and growth in online stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company achieves &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid earnings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , particularly in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
plans for vacation employment were announced one day later than those of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year .
in the quarter ending on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which were predicted by T@@ acks Investment Research analysts .
sales rose 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of them surv@@ ey@@ ed analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping which brought sales in its Un@@ ity Express shipment to stagn@@ ation .
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher earnings because of higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labor costs in the freight business .
in the after@@ market trade , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares declined by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
at its most awa@@ ited meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Honduras ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to raise tri@@ ms for the first time for almost a decade .
above them at the end of the decorated two @-@ story cour@@ t@@ room , there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision which is too tight to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentives by the immediate short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the industry &apos;s data show that it is growing solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxi@@ ous to intensi@@ fy this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal loans - and be it just a quarter of a percentage point .
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they observe , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sec@@ ures the financial market itself .
about half of the econom@@ ists recently surv@@ ey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an interest rate this week .
the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator indicating a 30 % chance of an increase .
this suggests a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts sof@@ ten the blow by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday , the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage stood at 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the sentences at that time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they do not panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argue that an increase in interest would calm the financial markets because they would remove uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
still a month ago the F@@ ed seemed to be in good ways to raise the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be required , an increase in the proposition was expected .
although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , the improvement on the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Shar@@ ep@@ her@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world gathered at the end of last month after China had de@@ valued his currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rate fell by more than 16 % in May , as investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would ch@@ okes global growth .
the market has recovered this month , although the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation when to increase interest rates .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news of the weakness of the Chinese economy hadn &apos;t occurred in the past few weeks , they would put on the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former US staff member .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be technically included in its decision @-@ making process .
but in the end the F@@ ed became the world &apos;s monetary authority .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
the mere hint of the former editor Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , dis@@ b@@ anded confusion around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ vest@@ ing Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA noted that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
co@@ ater , right member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who advoc@@ ates interest rate increase , quoted decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia caused the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rates by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite limited identi@@ fiable effects on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should only put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 Mark@@ ing Fall , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on Inter@@ est Det@@ er@@ mination of the Bank of England .
the latest turbul@@ ences do not come close to that level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are getting upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead of time .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Assistance to Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to give you a warm welcome is not possible without the involvement of countless volunteer hel@@ pers .
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support non @-@ sel@@ fish asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine are among them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she also likes to teach with her 74 L@@ enzen .
every Thursday she does it at the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language .
of course , that &apos;s a different lesson than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande promoting nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS , in a shock@@ ing way , tries to clarify how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies that su@@ ck breasts that are painted with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research indicates that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , un@@ healthy eating of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction proposal for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atten@@ ed for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ awa@@ ited Turn@@ halle at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step . in the recent public council session , the elabor@@ ated building application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; previously , among other things , the committee had decided on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; permission was granted for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ central &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; top and roof top &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
background of the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this means that we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting .
in the case of &quot; liberation , &quot; it was again the roof tendency , which is supposed to lie below ten degrees due to energy @-@ related reasons - unlike in the building plan .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the building plan does not allow &quot; exceptions &quot; in relation to the roof tendency - whereby the Bern@@ ese community generally drives more restric@@ tively in the case of exemp@@ tion orders .
however , the gymn@@ asi@@ um building is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said .
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the cost .
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ atitude promotion .
in the next step the building application for the 18 x 36 metre hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt ( Land@@ rats@@ amt ) for review .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg will be closed earlier than planned - namely in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will become the new Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital .
the station and the majority of staff move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed .
however , a decision on this will be given to the Supervisory Board and will meet on Wednesday , 23 September .
should the plans be implemented , then all of the almost 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the existing inner station .
the rooms are available .
employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au will be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
employees are informed of the plans .
the change was initiated by Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fis@@ her@@ man &quot; came into play with the question of who should succeed him , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was in every case a &quot; upgrading &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer for internal medicine , &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ology on the inside .
for the next two years , fis@@ her and his team are to lead the two houses , until next year the former hospital of the squ@@ ad , which still has 35 beds , is to be finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
until now , the administrative district had planned for 2018 unless the current refur@@ bish@@ ment is completed at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital .
coun@@ cill@@ or J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also chair@@ woman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the federal government , will in future be used as shelter for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I close it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the property goes on , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at present , a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry are accommod@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something better could not happen to us , such an opportunity will not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fischer said about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .
the pal@@ p@@ ses of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called for the Berg@@ ischer HC this evening ( 20.@@ 15 h ) .
although the leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga is the clear favourite in Wuppertal , there is no reason for arro@@ gan@@ ce .
in the past season , Bad@@ ener gained a hur@@ t@@ ful defeat in the Bh@@ c and got something good there .
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during ma@@ ize harvesting on Tuesday afternoon .
during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ kreis Witt@@ enberg ) several h@@ unters were in action , as the police shared .
after a shot of a shot , a 63 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals .
it was unclear at first how exactly it could come to the accident .
the Criminal Police Det@@ er@@ mines .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violence
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ p@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate missing since Saturday .
during inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old gave up that the young people were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a rock in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing from Saturday , has fallen victim to violence .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and the police announced on Wednesday .
a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , also arrested on Tuesday evening , is considered to be an active suspect , according to the fact that the investig@@ ators lead to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after they hadn &apos;t come home as agreed on the eve of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of ques@@ tioning in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , a suspi@@ ci@@ ons against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old finally emerged .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ rac@@ tor reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the dead were placed in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put him on death .
the further investigations are to bring about the near@@ er circumstances of action .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing space
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for an affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social housing construction is facing a challenge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the distribution battles on the German housing market have long begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and job seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units will have to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is concluded . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
in this way , 14@@ 0,000 dwell@@ ings are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then b@@ ump into the housing market and enter the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also under@@ lines significant om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is pushing a housing deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
currently , some 77@@ 0,000 units have already been missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study , compl@@ ains .
many professionals therefore lived in big cities in need of flat rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; invol@@ un@@ tarily because of the lu@@ te on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order to solve the problem , the Alliance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing .
this could be wai@@ ved by the real estate tax and the property tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed apartments may be temporarily suspended .
in addition , according to the Alliance , attractive tax depreciation options are necessary .
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the Kf@@ W state bank is already well received in cities and municipalities .
a good week after the start , with 184 million euros on Monday evening , more than half of the available 300 million euros have been rec@@ alled .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia follow corridor
practically no passage to Hungary is possible , as more and more refugees choose the road to Croatia .
Zagreb announces to grant transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Interior Minister and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border was turned off , hundreds of refugees have fled to Croatia in order to get to Western Europe from there .
the Croatian television channel RT@@ L reports that 500 people had come across the border at T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
Hungary had closed its border for refugees on the day before .
new laws which entered into force on the same day also practically eliminate ordinary asylum procedures in Hungary .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , they are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
in the morning the Croatian police arrested the first refugees on the border of Serbia to the neighbouring country of Croatia .
according to media reports , most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they came with both the bus and taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders .
for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 90@@ s .
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
however , after the closure of the border , there are barely any more refugees coming to Hungary .
police attacked 3@@ 66 on Tuesday .
shortly before the end of the gate on Monday there were only 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws guarantee the overcoming and damage of the border fence as criminal off@@ ence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 pen@@ al proceedings were initiated in the southern Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
Sent@@ enced pen@@ alties thre@@ aten to five years and deport@@ ation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; transit zones &quot; set up on the border , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
the applicants were 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees .
however , practically no one has any prospect of granting asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past weeks .
locking grids have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border area has been rebuilt .
nobody wanted to comment on the aim of this reconstruction .
after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants still remained in the country following government declar@@ ations .
in Salzburg approximately 1400 people are waiting for the on@@ ward journey to Germany .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees arrived on foot regularly .
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; over the border
&quot; after the Brück@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel buyers were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler .
tourists , they wanted to go by train to Passa@@ u .
because Germany had surprisingly adjusted rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the border along with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u .
previously we had the un@@ hoped guests once ch@@ oked , with snacks and drinks .
we just said we are bringing her to Passa@@ u by car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stra@@ ined train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u on Sunday evening in W@@ els , after the announcement that rail traffic was set to Germany , but still trying to cross the border .
the regional train was turned off before the border into W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein , the cross border is generally high in the course .
the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , on the previous day a two @-@ brid@@ ging sport - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of an hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of assist@@ ing inst@@ ant@@ an@@ e@@ ously in the establishment of structures in order to guarantee humanity , our Federal Chancellor excit@@ edly and publicly supported the Hungarian government &apos;s position in the dun@@ ks of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chao@@ tic conditions in the border regions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge to establish decent conditions for asylum seek@@ ers in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and there will be even greater peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad looking for 35@@ ,000 winter@@ ized quar@@ tz@@ es
Konrad , with the forbi@@ dding of refugees , has to do all his hands full .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place quarters for the thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the first lift center of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on Konrad .
&quot; we have no more hom@@ eless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the placing of the 20,000 refugees coming to Austria on Monday was also carried out without great vor@@ tices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad , and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; master performance &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in a he@@ ur@@ ly year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide the countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
should there be more refugees , we can do it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it &apos;s not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the national capitals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they would have assured him not to create neighbour@@ hoods for the coming refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s good in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier .
former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Con@@ rad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations in the ORF action &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Help like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yesterday , Konrad and Ma@@ ier critici@@ zed the standards for placing as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency it may not be that lod@@ g@@ ings must observe a certain amount of the towel rail or the size of the duties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , explains that in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he succ@@ eeds in placing himself more successful .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further into the face the un@@ truth .
power of persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not inc@@ ur any costs to the republic , as they themselves declared .
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
the own neighborhood search has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container on the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are apparently problems with permission .
Linz requires a better parti@@ tioning
for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center to shelter refugees is planning the city of Linz .
this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers are currently unable to accommodate these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) .
for the emergency , however , further sites are to be tested for their suitability .
the city leader critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; boundaries are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday called for further action in the refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not un@@ sealed .
the res@@ ignation of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no special trains with refugees to Germany for the time being .
however , the seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fact that Austria is now introducing controls on its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger , &quot; from the actions of the Germans .
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
&quot; &quot; &quot; the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial line is officially completed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the publicly tra@@ ded IT Group S &amp; T has moved into four of the six floors of the office and production building . the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; D leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in the startup companies of the New Wer@@ ft and later on to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - as Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni owner opened second shop in the ar@@ cade
the new shop focuses on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags .
J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade in short : after all , she has now gained an increase in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the business , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around women &apos;s hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 Euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , it was rebuilt several weeks ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I have long thought about whether I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Br@@ eit said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive factor for the decision was , among other things , that Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location in which only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; we are the only ones in the Linz Europe region who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who own Italian roots .
her interest in fashion has been born in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
I feel most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so many women are looking at a beautiful hand@@ bag in rap@@ ture , the skilled woman cannot answer with the last certainty .
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag re@@ stores every outfit .
the ro@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose residents are called investors .
some people also connect to the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , ex@@ poses journalists or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office sp@@ ills the election campaign power@@ fully .
and cut off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from .
the New Yorker finds a term for many in the wine @-@ growing village on the wine route .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1200 inhabitants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; place are related to him over -@@ nin@@ ety corners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that somehow find it exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in its K@@ all@@ stadt fashion , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has shot an am@@ using documentary film about the place and its famous sho@@ ots , which alongside Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of the heart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , I tend to think that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pumping &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit of a mouth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circum@@ ference , was &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher . &quot; in High German : the len@@ ders , she says .
so Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the len@@ ders .
the story of Tr@@ ump began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the first real estate group was the foundation stone of the real estate group in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to home in the long run failed to fail at the Bavarian State , which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged then .
the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy , Roland Paul , was declared a film start by the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ no@@ graphy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; pumping is the grand@@ son of an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he had repeatedly spoken about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the Polish , this is not so sy@@ mp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The grand@@ mother was a born dr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the se@@ d@@ man in retirement sees the American rather distant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ anded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension scheme Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler .
and as a President ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my President is not , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Upper @-@ Bavaria district of Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden is Germany &apos;s first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1,@@ 800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ g@@ aden National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday .
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise domin@@ ates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the today show
Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has been no great shifts in Today &apos;s valu@@ ations .
the N@@ ine &apos;s breakfast show was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital , when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull proc@@ eeded to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the rival Sunrise , with the hosts David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , was in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n .
this disadvantage of the distance seemed to play no part for Australian TV viewers , as Sunrise posted an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five major cities , in comparison with Today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 .
today , today , a slight increase compared to the Rat@@ ings for Monday ( 3@@ 17.@@ 000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his figure dropped behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , Today has closed the gap to Sunrise .
in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18.@@ 000 compared to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year there was a gap between 40,000 and 50.000 .
up to now in September Sunrise was at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 Today .
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial band of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently wi@@ dow@@ ed father , who decides to settle down in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators .
critics wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could wear a hit show solo without the ra@@ fting Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million spectators and hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new quiz show , presented by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e resulted in an average of 44@@ ,000 spectators .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .

hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20.000 .
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening from The Ch@@ ase Australia will give N@@ ine the confidence that hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .

the last three agrees : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may unknow@@ ingly have who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , at which Sam Wood ended up in the Bachelor , was wrapped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ over girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ ann@@ on @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day before three of them are going to check , you may accidentally put an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood keeps his lips tight until the final on Thursday
all three women are ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and in doing so called his sense of hum@@ our , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last Rose ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their answers could become a game @-@ per@@ ish@@ able who won the heart of the tor@@ rent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s Energi@@ es noticed , I felt that they were quite compatible and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; Je@@ ann@@ on Fel@@ lows said .
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added .
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well @-@ suited as a couple .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that last week &apos;s visit to the house made her clear that Wood &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condi@@ tionally set to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked , W@@ wen W@@ oods should choose , if not she , there she was pu@@ zz@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can tell it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equal - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor will be broadcast on Ten Days on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the Bank when he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ts during his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t @-@ return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the game .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
Tom@@ sul@@ a also confirmed Hay@@ ne public at his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ por@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his neglected catch and to take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian cous@@ in had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the tre@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the Schn@@ itzer with his original debut at the time in 2007 when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high level of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
leader of the party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ van@@ er warned against a serious crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools at the start of the F@@ W in Groß@@ gel@@ stadt , if there is no adequate new teacher for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to save the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ van@@ er .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get block@@ ages in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ tag fraction of the Free elec@@ torate runs until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
actually , quite different main topics were planned .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free voters meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the issue of asylum will out@@ source the exam , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ ï@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the creation of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as they were during the Yugoslavia wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free voters head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to push free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ ï@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the F@@ W chief critic@@ ised that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need nationwide standards of the federal states &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavaria is pushing , others not . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to become more able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy should not fall under the table in Great Wall@@ stadt .
a long lasting torch remains the order of the day : education policy .
for the new school year , Education Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot project &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus , &quot; where an extension of the secondary school will be tested from three to four years .
but that does not go far enough .

4 People killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday .
the force erup@@ ted on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an , about 175 miles west of the capital Kath@@ mandu .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , Chief Executive Officer , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators were gathered outside a police station , throwing stones and incen@@ diary bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
twenty police officers and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , which are known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as less mort@@ als , obviously produced such a high death rate .
the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ri@@ ans say that new provinces being formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in Western Nepal by the ethnic group of Th@@ arus , who want its own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent disputes since the 10th century .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; August killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very controversial topic in Nepal ruled over for centuries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators agreed this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday .
construction site planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ der Youth Centre in Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for marketing the 4000 square meter area .
a mix of trade , trade and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet .
Em@@ den - Em@@ den City wants to market around 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the Old Post Youth Centre .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commerce and housing .
one is waiting for appropriate offers , it is called by the city .
the investor &apos;s question is not yet clear .
no contracts have yet been concluded .
the town of Em@@ den had already purchased a part of the property , which is located at Ring@@ straße / Road , a few months ago and demoli@@ shed the building on it .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement on the Little Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
some An@@ li@@ eger are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure center
for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , bur@@ dened , deb@@ ated and drawn .
now the plans for a new holiday resort on the small sea near Em@@ den are on the table .
the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time in the urban development committee of the Em@@ den Council on Monday evening .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group , accused of investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends went on to the offensive by the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
for months , the project has been in discussion for about ten to twelve million euros .
violent reactions among the owners of the sea , who had come to the meeting , produced the images and new details about the desired hotel building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the sea and board member of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , lam@@ ents : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant clause that over@@ looks all the other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , he fears , like some other project critics , that traffic would increase sharply by the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; entire bus loads must come to pay off &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what happens exactly on the well one hectare site of the former restaurant is still open .
there is still no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we must have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this still lack@@ ed , the development plans are still variable .

Google launches dou@@ bling campaign campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl ! O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have over@@ run the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the call to don@@ ate on its blog .
instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google associate , who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
but since the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help .
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many escaped from the war torn Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya .
reporting Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; editing by Christian Pl@@ umb
for easily obes@@ e di@@ abe@@ tics , weight loss surgery may be helpful .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after losing weight loss live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mortality data require a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial for the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
over the years , obesity treatments have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a measure of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital , which they have collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were overweight .
the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly the same at 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely dis@@ b@@ anded and 28 % partial .
in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes completely dis@@ b@@ anded in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent .
in addition , the results of the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol in general were better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers .
after the operation , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team compared also average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass @-@ surgery group lost more weight compared with the host @-@ rec@@ tom@@ ie group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 versus 5.1 ) and h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded rather a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study shows no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there is evidence from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die over 15 years in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery - compared to a group that tried conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was so@@ othing for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we wait too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think once they have am@@ assed these genetic changes that have permanently tied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in the Hun@@ sr@@ ück
it is a topic that is becoming increasingly popular in fiction : a young woman , un@@ loved and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her .

beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting for Hun@@ sr@@ ück reader , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .

&quot; it &apos;s impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis lies in the Middle East . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist leader called for the end of violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under certain circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama commen@@ ded Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and emphasized that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him that the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four times increase of taking of hands dis@@ infection by children in the last 4 years
po@@ ison@@ ous control centres in the US report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years who swal@@ low strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ infection agents such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre .
according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of income from hand dis@@ infection in children under 12 years , the poison control centres report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately , a percentage of them will go in emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said some children can deliberately drink dis@@ infection agents while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how teenagers drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants just because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens allegedly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think that &apos;s bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very attractive for children .
hand dis@@ infection products contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
very few sp@@ atter can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Tox@@ in Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City .
so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ ja Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who recently took four sp@@ lashes of after straw@@ berry du@@ ften@@ berg hands @-@ on disinf@@ ect@@ ant , was brought to the treatment in an emergency room .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency medical doctor who treated her in the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah le@@ aned her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen through the alcohol and had met her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ vie@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos; mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use alcohol @-@ free products or dis@@ infection di@@ aries and to store hands disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suggest that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was not@@ ated as an active ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the New York state planned to poison their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; common &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; teacher by expos@@ ing anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reports a police report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to the disinf@@ ect@@ ant and ban@@ ishes it from her room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police looked at the s@@ worn plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and discipl@@ ined action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;

the lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
former R@@ angers mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er has said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland they have no highlights of the Cel@@ tic Games and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of the ran@@ gers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will spin the things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la accepted that Cel@@ tic must fight , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen was followed , which now stand at the top of the table with five points .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cel@@ tic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what is happening .
we feel it this way - but we must go on .
we really need to really support Cel@@ tic because that makes the players better .
standing together is so important .

Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that Dun@@ dee United &apos;s management team has confidence in the management team to turn things - but admit that the decline has to end on the playing field .
I think that Stephen Thom@@ p@@ son has confidence in us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will get the guys back on tro@@ t , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Don@@ nel@@ ly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Inn@@ es is happy to &quot; not win &quot; to Hamilton .
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton &apos;s cies to see a seventh consecutive league victory , giving them a lead of five points ahead of Cel@@ tic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won anything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of that kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it increases overall .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the National Statistics Bureau ( O@@ NS ) showed .
meanwhile the employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I witness an execution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
somewhat later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is put to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in an audience gallery in the death chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was already for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed , I agreed .
when the day drew closer , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media spaces from 12 to five .
who is chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ ps close friend , with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; form@@ ulate it better , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but she still thinks that it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
when he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ yar@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts I made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to detail here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his acts after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
man after hum@@ id police ch@@ ase persu@@ aded to come from the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he spoke to the man of the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to susp@@ end the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was founded on Tuesday for a family peace break in pel@@ vic .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River .
but he did not come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negotiating . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins ro@@ de his car in the tren@@ ches to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threatened to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
he aimed at ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt tu@@ g test at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
he with@@ held 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had a long time to say nothing about it , and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to go about my head raised , and I want my owners to think I am doing my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I shouldn &apos;t be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ usa that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry B@@ ail@@ ey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to deliver information about what I am doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said on rac@@ usa .
they obviously believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to seize me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ dy , Vice @-@ President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still alive today .
should this bring me to the point that it is going to be personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
perhaps they must take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about .
but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad .
that makes me really sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the trainer &apos;s fru@@ stration levels have been set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; throw out his license over the table . &quot;
M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ defeated master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a package of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously applied mud to the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been like yesterday evening .
it could have been so yesterday all day , which was so .
but it had it on the race day too .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it &apos;s a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
man arrested after driver &apos;s flight
on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycli@@ st and subsequent driver curse in Cob@@ ram .
the cycli@@ st was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said that the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats rival to ring fight claims
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critici@@ zed the tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as an &quot; agenda setting &quot; of two premi@@ er league favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters coach Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the ump@@ ires allowed the Storm players &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ring fights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ co trainer Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ sting note to the Storm team after his crew scored the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the w@@ rest@@ ling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ tile of his crew and said she was concentr@@ ating only on her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading coaches in his team would give him a confident voice as it meant that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always comes up again - I have not heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have not changed anything to our defensive system or techniques all year round . but in the last six weeks we have made our contact at Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years and he obviously has a great team to train . he is probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it is strange how this time and again this season emerges .
Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts idea of &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team in 2010 , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a divor@@ ce .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have these kinds of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as these .
I build stronger faith because they say these things because they are a bit worried about playing against us .
six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that Storm vs R@@ oo@@ sters scored a higher result than the game of Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are p@@ auses and no d@@ ots something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
when they talk to us , it means that we will meet them in a single phase .
the Storm team has been free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the pre @-@ final at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin tomorrow morning .
Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on Drug Tra@@ ins
a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long punishment because of his attempt to come into the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a security deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kil@@ os of drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a potentially life sentence for the attempt to possess a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire crowd and that it could have been a harmless reason in the café .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned with the danger of refugees at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday .
in the case of criminal proceedings , he lied to the police of his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security in order to reach his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its declar@@ ations of the two people it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said judge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit under the conditions that he gives off his Australian and Serbian passport , noti@@ fies the police on a daily basis and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
accident at A5 near Karlsruhe : managing director pul@@ ls apart
on Tuesday evening a truck driver was seriously injured in a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the free@@ way 5 near Karlsruhe .
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver re@@ marked it late and tried in vain to ev@@ ade the last moment to the left , as the police shared .
the driver &apos;s cab of the accident @-@ causing storm tore apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely blocked from six hours to 2 o &apos;clock .
this resulted in a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg employed telephone of girls to l@@ ure ped@@ ophi@@ le to send images
a teen@@ ager used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to claim pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent images of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother .
the police took care of it and saw the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web searches , which used terms to search for in@@ decent images of children .
Ho@@ gg pre@@ tended to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and he then &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , that he was addic@@ ted to sc@@ aring people .
he admitted that searches on the computer were performed by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
he said he was sick in the head when drinking , and said he would then see pictures of rape and murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the trem@@ bling and crying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused took advantage of computer and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he did .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ decent images of children on 14 June last year , to have viol@@ ated the conditions on January 25 and did not appear before the Court for a hearing on 24 March this year .
defence lawyer Greg@@ or S@@ im requested that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; could be found in his crime .
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed the sentence until October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit in this case , but was held pending trial due to hear@@ ings to other cases pending .
it was added before the date of judgment to the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bad user &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; switches to small border cross@@ ings to Germany &quot; &quot; &quot;
more and more refugees are taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
for fear of discovery and arrest , many s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers increased people to smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the River Inn river Inn in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and st@@ ow@@ lers to the German side .
there , they are received by the Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
in comparison to the weekly start of Wednesday , more refugees arrived at Munich Central Station in comparison to the start of the week .
around 700 people have arrived in the state capital alone until 8.@@ 00 a.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re @-@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest expected
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area via Western Europe , warm sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart , Germany , announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the strong low is the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic Ocean from the Bermuda Islands in the past few days . &quot; &quot; &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D , up to Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Boden@@ se@@ award with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun can be seen again .
the mass is doing it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 2015 is mainly due to movement among compact cars , which currently sell particularly well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
cars from the compact class are particularly in demand : roughly 28@@ ,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone , according to the German Federal Authority ( KBA ) .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( Public Parti@@ cles 17 to 27 September ) .
many new compact models will be presented this year between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at deal@@ er@@ ships in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive .
R@@ üssel@@ sheim . Opel offers a view below the largest competi@@ tor VW Golf in the view starting at 17 650 euros .
the current Astra costs 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra comes with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
the H@@ esse also offers further diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines are for the first time .
unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only available as a five @-@ door model .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the combined cycle , which is already visible at the IAA .
and what will happen next to the Astra at the IAA still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is to be seen exclusively as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version .
in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a combined instrument .
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan investor wants to find his position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
with its curved lines , the compact Infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ er put their hand on the front : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , especially the inf@@ otainment system was moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrating Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the f@@ aded Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court has given right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Justice prison Te@@ gel , who was housed in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are entitled to financial compensation in principle if they are accommod@@ ated in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
the persons affected can even hope for money if they were locked up in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus , an ex @-@ prisoner was successful in Karlsruhe with his constitutional complaint : he was accommod@@ ated in a Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters floor space ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated .
after that , the man , who is meanwhile on the open ground according to his lawyer , has been moved to a larger cell .
his position of office as a result of the un@@ dig@@ ni@@ fied detention conditions against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and returned the case back to the trial .
they see man &apos;s human dignity viol@@ ated .
chamber court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons only a few days of arrest were decisive for compensation , a claim was issued , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a mu@@ til@@ ation of the legal protection of the personality would be afraid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the compensation of money .
in the past , the constitutional judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners .
so they only spoke of a prisoner &apos;s compensation in April because he was imprisoned in a cell naked .
according to a 2011 decision , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy .
on Wednesday , Karlsruhe additionally confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had reached a decent housing for a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
for three months , the former plain@@ ti@@ ff was accommod@@ ated daily between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case .
in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines due to missing personnel .
prisoners are therefore always included in 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even to ra@@ ckets it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation .
according to information from the Press Office , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied due to lack of junior staff , and 19 are to fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what to do in Germany ?
according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Architecture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) are used annually - for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it has ever been built ( 250@@ 000 homes ) .
dramatic is the lack of housing , but especially for affordable rental objects . annually , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing are out of the rental price , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the viewpoint of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing per year would have to arise and for this the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion a year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in agreement , scientists and federal mini@@ stries are in agreement that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia critic@@ ises Walter , Project Manager for Integration and Education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
labour is the key to social contacts , for appreciation in the Society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ard@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from the ban on labour for refugees to recognise work .
whereas previously there was a ban on employment for asylum seek@@ ers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as did the residence duty to limit asylum seek@@ ers to a place of residence .
in society - also because of a shortage of skilled staff - the view has mostly been set by the fact that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly .
lack of German knowledge is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient offer of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
therefore , the structure of networks is the Königs@@ weg der Königs@@ weg for work integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few escaped parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents it is very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ya Ko@@ stools , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages .
if the need for educ@@ ators would rise sharply by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of training - for example by allowing more vocational schools .
in the countries students without knowledge of the German will be prepared for lessons .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ eger from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that approximately 20 percent of refugees in Germany want to study .
in principle , no federal asylum seek@@ er or patient was forbidden to study - the only exception to date was Berlin , internal sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now quit his position .
studying willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated by access to the university .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because refugees with a residence permit or divor@@ ce do not receive any services after the asylum seek@@ er performance law if they start a study . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the latter generally do not receive a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the bene@@ fici@@ ary persons .
patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be B@@ af@@ ö@@ g @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 this span is shortened to 15 months .
however , this financing gap must also be closed , call for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should get B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity .
the state should step by step the same rights as they have the churches , and develop the existing state churches right to a new state religions relationship .
the establishment of an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally , would also be important .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contacts and be ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to take preced@@ ence against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany .
those who wanted to viol@@ ate such conflicts in Germany immediately &quot; have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; integration will in future be much more than today a topic of the whole society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a result , the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism is more urgent .
Germany indeed has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general gender equality law since a decade .
but it slowly lear@@ ns how the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ series showed , in which police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motif .
equal chances for all : what migrants &apos; organizations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans are demanding for a long time and which international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ ism convention Germany commit must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use its options - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is capable of providing medical care to the refugees who have been expected so far , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as for man@@ - power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must be incorporated into the system .
to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to hand out health cards right away .
provided services could be rep@@ uted later with the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able that so many people are excluded from the limited service catalogue that the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors make especially the language barriers .
even so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are less aware of their diseases than other patients .
it is not only in clinics , but also in medical practices that interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over .
for many refugees it would also be helped with more general medical centres in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; among refugee children , for example , there are significantly more untreated disabilities , and in young people it is about HIV @-@ clari@@ fication . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the partly different cases of disease , German physicians come from their education but clearly , writes Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis is not so difficult to identify . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as for the lack of doctors , the refugees might even be allevi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Syri@@ ans have a sophisticated education system ; many refugees are doctors .
in order to be able to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and possibly take examinations again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates of the Psycho@@ therap@@ y@@ bank ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most people suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
the refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee boat arrives in Germany traumati@@ zed .
those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer , among other things , the so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rage and death @-@ fears .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe fri@@ ght and emotional num@@ b@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
yet so far only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , mentally ill asylum seek@@ ers can make an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but usually lasts for several months .
in addition , in the social offices , mostly cler@@ ical workers or doctors who are not trained for psych@@ ic illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the new st@@ aging &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Passion &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Circus Festival rever@@ ts to the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the tiles .
&quot; our passion is cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ ress and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in .
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current man@@ e production .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
thus , the gift for lovers lies in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get people away from their everyday lives and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasizes the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ tian with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst calls his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometer long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with wi@@ t and charm .
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo want to easily record it .
ease and flexibility - they identify with these words .
her humor@@ ous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
apart from numerous salmon @-@ cla@@ ws , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus festival also fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and ten@@ acity .
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
it is not a problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ ak@@ es@@ men fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little others and fascin@@ ates with their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t feel good either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , are read off by the eyes as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to go to the arena .
so the supreme command : good for the animals .
especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst tells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
there should be something for each visitor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 spectators , we always give our best and are there whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to your ideas every day from September 17 @-@ 20 at 5 : 00 p.m .
on Sunday the program begins at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the Ti@@ ersch@@ au is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe has wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ines . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past month , they had rested and interrupted him during his speech on the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of Parliament that immunity in parliament ends and as soon as they leave parliament its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard to reduce up to 30.000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25.000 to 30.000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities .
the expected job cuts lead to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man .
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to meet the changing needs of our customers all over the world .
Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ matched , integrated technology solutions for businesses , &quot; explains the company &apos;s statement .
it divi@@ des a company founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage one has called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to tackle the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that tight focused companies perform better performance .
FC Ar@@ senal master Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphasized against Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will surely be uncertain at the European Championship .
the great dis@@ grace in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten career , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that doesn &apos;t heal properly .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kl@@ es or with the injuries that he had previously had .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has posted 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Ar@@ sen@@ als 157 League players in the last five seasons .
the broader picture of ar@@ senal is that in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 they were one of the two premi@@ er league clubs that have recorded the most injuries days .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but ar@@ senal believes that an improvement in the injury rate will last throughout the last season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a prone period of time , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win combat force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
ar@@ senal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea in Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team .
H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to get a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although ar@@ senal was clear favorites to move on through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measured in the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Ar@@ senal has drawn the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League Cap@@ it@@ ulation to Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ away hope to lead the club to its first European cup of Europe with its management .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it has never worked for ar@@ senal .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the com@@ edy show , giving us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
the lack of similar represent@@ ations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , as suicide rates among young men will prove on a 15 @-@ year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in the UK , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced the year of the man with the aim of ques@@ tioning the culture that men are preventing them from seeking help when they need them .
friendship is the cent@@ er@@ piece in the fight to overcome this challenge .
a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms confirmed that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery were doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends once so that a friendship can work .
in the age of communication managed through social media , with its emphasis on substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than an important contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful even if in reality the isolation domin@@ ates .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy .
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was placed on my head .
each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which spark@@ led through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football pitches in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can relate to it , even though they often with@@ hold themselves to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as a staff of telep@@ hon@@ y explained to me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ promised is clearly shown to me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to speak with friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as weakness if you talk openly about problems . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
as much my objective out@@ sider status about the telephone might help people in moments of despair , long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship might make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani following his match against Malm@@ ö .
in his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , Maria di Maria helps PS@@ G to pass by Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ mond Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since they not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck @-@ out rounds , but an improvement along the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a class game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the association , with which he began his illustri@@ ous career already in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and look back relaxed even if there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting during the season , &quot; Blanc said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two other goals . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which on the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First Division , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing pop@@ s was called the man who can take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he was taken over by Manchester United in the last month , and he indicated why when he entered Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ and passed beautifully into the long corner of the grid .
but if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ ö , who hit Cel@@ tic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , played at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was str@@ ung with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle ground str@@ ung a heavy opponent .
but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed a long way to Kevin Tra@@ pps &apos;s posts in the 3@@ 4th minute , they did little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes abandoned itself , with some mis@@ passes and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which was scra@@ ped in the first half of not less than five attempts at no less than five attempts after rel@@ aun@@ ching it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill , when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c which turned Di Maria into a spin that was guided by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the post ...
the second gate finally fell short after the 24 @-@ hour mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an joined the sixth season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had bl@@ ended up a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö can come back to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the final result low before replacement player E@@ z@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi received a gate at the end .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ av@@ i : pe@@ p Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 changing to FC Bayern
world champion and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years prior to the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who at that time played for FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion league winner , four times champion league champion , twice World Champion , twice World Champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he was already in Barcelona before the 2008 European Championship .
&quot; I told Bar@@ ça to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says .
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer from Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 Jürgen Klin@@ smann acquired the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European Championships . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with this he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have gone with X@@ av@@ i ?
X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavarian over the entire distance on the grass , switched off the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s triumph .
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted African @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a series of Sunday night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted the need for alternative perspectives , with regards to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it in the filling of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured .
brown responded shock@@ ed , with s@@ worn un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian got stuck .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the celeb@@ ri@@ ties Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nut that is beaten by her white im@@ itation .
the producer of Dear White People spoke to the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film directing rights ; Dam@@ on said that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded with dis@@ approval via Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room , so he can explain its diversity - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et deser@@ ved more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 li@@ kes since its release .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
after being killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the teen@@ age son Michael Brown scored a nationwide impact on the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement and urged public authorities and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against coloured livel@@ ih@@ oods .
in February the singer Prince put an all@@ usion to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album sil@@ ently &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
in recent times , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as an hatred group .
&quot; the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter network is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ esses invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West .
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crow@@ ned first champion
professional sport clim@@ ber and assistance from Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final .
the last task was to climb a 75 foot @-@ long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge fully three seconds faster , making him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock over the win of the Big Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer , K@@ ent We@@ ed , sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not receive any prize money .
according to the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there &apos;s more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed .
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he has a gru@@ dge about it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers s@@ ne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
mint O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not especially funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
they used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers are standing in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part perfectly on Tuesday against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target Field .
the T@@ wins wa@@ sted a chance to climb in one half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so difficult to summari@@ ze over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tiger pitch Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then again in ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) scored 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s hard to throw at bul@@ l@@ ring any game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was the first three @-@ hit play by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he sw@@ ung the wood well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Aus@@ sie said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good during ( kick training ) , looked much better at the bul@@ l@@ fight , and he brought it directly into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh inner ring the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a col@@ t , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy ran down the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who delivered a Two @-@ Run game to the right @-@ handed shot of Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the final run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League for the 27th time in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe struck a double play
after adding a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , wall made a RB@@ I double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the booth of 5 @-@ 4 .
the right @-@ handed one , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three pitches for his fifth Save .
in the beginning of the game , Detroit prof@@ ited from a mo@@ ve@@ able Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three R@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted in front of the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month because of a back pain .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wanted , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I was getting started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first one , Hus@@ hai gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z placed his 0 @-@ 21 track record with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which the threat ended .
the Tig@@ ers increased in the second , achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or added .
he has not sounded particularly well , but he has caught the right place .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch count , did not score points in the third inning before being replaced by the Reli@@ ever Jus@@ tices A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and one walk with four k@@ nit@@ re outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the lit@@ ters .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , on the edge of the vulner@@ ability list since mid @-@ August , will be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is removed from the list of injuries to compete against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30th
he has been missing since 20 August for a ri@@ f@@ le in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ota R@@ HP Al@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )

Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria include an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for a possibility .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he accused the European states of &quot; collective exile . &quot;
four years ago we were happy that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is landing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international assistance on the ground for the refugees .
Austria controls on southern and eastern borders
in Germany , Austria has again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
Austrian Interior Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner announced on Tuesday evening in Austrian television broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , to Hungary no one will be sent back to Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany too has not returned refugees to Austria . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement with which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mr Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and Repres@@ ent@@ atives in Germany .
she did not call on concrete figures and referred to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
in recent days tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary .
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit next week with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far not been able to agree on a common action in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more 120 000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting .
in view of the strong refugee status in Germany , the federal government wants to support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people .
the federal government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late afternoon after almost four hours of consultations with the Prime Ministers in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
Merkel under@@ lined those people who would need protection .
but if you do not have a lead perspective , you cannot stay in Germany .
this opinion has been overwhel@@ m@@ ingly dealt with in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilomet@@ re @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday .
a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest that the border to Romania could be brid@@ ged with a fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said about the planned new border fence , Hungary &apos;s foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had crossed the fence .
in Turkey , according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , thousands of other migrants reported on the road to the Greek border .
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus
under the iron p@@ anz@@ er of Saturn &apos;s En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus a global ocean sw@@ aps .
this is what researchers conclude from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
the moon is therefore slightly stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets .
although this motion is only small , but still too large for a permanent cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State New York ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the cover of En@@ cel@@ a@@ dus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ oes at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s Moon in 2006 , sp@@ itting water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring des Saturn &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least on the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then .
however , the extent of the hidden ocean has not been clari@@ fied .

R@@ ama had already lam@@ ented pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; expected four weeks of forced break &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ent loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we need to think about it now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n der Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the potential commitment of a non @-@ compatible professional . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , as a train@@ ee , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Kro@@ ate has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ ur .
no diet fruit - man@@ gos contain much sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and juicy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to their slender line are often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - mainly su@@ c@@ rose .
however , the exotic fruits are healthy : B vitamins and vitamins E and C. above all , man@@ goes contain much vitamin A and its pre @-@ press beta car@@ ot@@ ene .
the person who eats the fruits thus supports the vision , the immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste naturally pure or in sweet foods .
a man@@ go also gives a special touch to sav@@ our@@ y dishes .
it moder@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
and a man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game .

on Thursday morning the hair dri@@ fts off the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly weather@@ ed rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strongly until stor@@ my , and temperatures clearly decrease .

Rome has a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was christ@@ ened on the name of the German Re@@ former on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the Association of Protestant Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the city of the Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible that their tradition of Christian faith is welcomed in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a rotten source of sin .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions might have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the split of the oc@@ ci@@ dental Church with his theses against the De@@ al@@ ant .
hammer Artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt has painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updates Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who in 150 motifs formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but this is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pictures . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , it can quite be quite dark .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many theme areas of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; book of all books &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity .
he has thus spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther publishing house with his the@@ ological focus as well as for the Kettler publishing house with his focus on art books .
and here is mainly the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he interpreted the biblical passages that were selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and translated into &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into current contexts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation by Martin Luther and one sentence of the artist , which formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry clasp has golden letters .
this allows the 75 @-@ year @-@ old to gain a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
emotions were ultimately the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rec@@ alls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work up , perhaps to bring myself again to the Lord &apos;s father . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to make art more important again in the fast @-@ moving time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is characterised by advertising and that is loud .
symboli@@ sm is sup@@ planted .
artists have another desire and joy to show things .
images always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewers fall into the images , let them appear , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; the picture is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost conf@@ essed on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Kunst : &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not paid attention to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the topics that are important for him , but also mysterious themes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; Alt@@ ep@@ ost says : &quot; here &apos;s the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the original - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15th .
start of construction for BM@@ X railway
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model the hill for a circuit : one year later almost everything was ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X @-@ Bahn it was over again .
failures in politics and administration ensured the dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the train .
so looking down hill , looking for new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit .
the approval will be received in October , the first municipal coun@@ cill@@ or Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this year will happen again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; further blu@@ ep@@ r@@ int &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor pool . &quot; &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees by 2019 , and the Bundes@@ li@@ ga a clear sign on the weekend .
the football respon@@ ds to the situation to be seen in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in cop@@ ing with the problems that arise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he will intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the Chanc@@ ellery next Wednesday and meet Ms. Ö@@ z@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the issue will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the football could and wanted to help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but the decisive course must put politics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee Initiative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s , Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Bundes@@ li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
already on this weekend , the 36 professional associations set a clear sign when they will wear the &quot; Wir - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen &apos;s sports director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama is going on , nobody can see . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can play football feder@@ ations , no , we have to use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so unbeliev@@ ably , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the league . &quot;
on Friday the national team of the women invited 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Cup qualifying game against Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a large community of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licence clubs had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent will be lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association together with the DF@@ B @-@ Sel@@ ection and the Federal Government will provide 300@@ ,000 euros each for the integration of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the associations have already called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : CEO losing an eye in case of accident
the Chief Executive Officer of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
at the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , after midnight , he fell on a water glass , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is almost bloo@@ dless , impot@@ ent , then tow@@ ed himself to the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cited the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; Platt@@ ner said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of work &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t der &quot; S@@ Z . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t typically comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to get up again when you &apos;ve fallen down . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren &apos;t spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen except combat ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ tered a corresponding picture and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
he therefore comes as little as a reserv@@ ist in Singapore on the weekend for the two common drivers Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , just like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan .
football : Bv@@ F without Re@@ us against K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback made by Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League finally fell apart .
the national player will also miss the championship leader of the Bundes@@ li@@ ga in Du@@ el with the F@@ K K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 pm / Sky ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; if Re@@ us will be back in the Bundes@@ li@@ ga Top@@ spiel for Le@@ verk@@ usen on Sunday , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high strain on his pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change his el@@ event@@ h position on the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change to the door@@ keeper position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller occupies the place of tribal @-@ keepers Roman brus@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football instructor praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tu@@ ch@@ el , however , was open to whether turn@@ tables will be used in all Europa League games in the future .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the for@@ c statement by fellow player Re@@ us , that the final suit for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , keeps middle @-@ field players Julian W@@ eig@@ l for understandable : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so Marco is not so wrong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to pick up the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot &apos;s account : government wants to play a pioneering role in Germany
according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany is supposed to be a technological pioneer in the change of the car .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility era &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt .
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who come together with representatives from industry at the International Motor Show .
the ministry &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio communications .
to test new technology , there is currently a test track on the free@@ way 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no additional risks of liability arise &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to check the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to ensure that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is lifted from 10 to 130 kilometres per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the human being as a driver .
in automated driving , the driver increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more the passenger .
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically possible by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions at the German site value the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of passenger cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the question of liability for accidents and the security of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied .
but the Germans are still skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the test organization Dek@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the next ten years , 32 percent do not expect to believe in 31 percent at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ ey@@ ed with autonomous driving cars up to 20@@ 25 are expecting 33 per cent in the US .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after surve@@ ying the digital association Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could at least imagine 15 percent , in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circum@@ stance .
B@@ oll says team and double start at Table Tennis European Championships
according to the current status of the title fight from 25th September to 4th October , the Düsseldorf @-@ based Düsseldorf will only want to hit the single .
the final decision should be made no later than 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to get the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the German coach Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf in Düsseldorf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time , B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor date in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo , the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favourite now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the individual European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ sch@@ atz in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the EM 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo also was missing and we became European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what we should ori@@ ent ourselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Fi@@ fth Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has contracted a serious injury on the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a enf@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look frigh@@ ten@@ ingly human thanks to video projections .
they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t say today that I &apos;m the enf@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung from September 18 , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at the beginning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit like death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you come to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprentices@@ hip .
chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed total artwork for which much effort was carried out : to fr@@ inge the d@@ olls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired for example .
according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot carried out 14 tons of material to Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather pants outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first tent@@ ative , fashionable beh@@ est of the designer .
as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
to play with a doll , his parents would not have allowed him .
he later taught himself the dis@@ car@@ ding of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers , as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they didn &apos;t get anything , but they were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ en tip as a fashion niche
it used to be on the long Emb@@ ro@@ i@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they used for example to produce blankets and she@@ ers .
this is no longer working today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en fashion j@@ uts .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener leadership fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche .
Rein@@ hardt calls for some examples : lace in jewelry , accessories such as bags and in regional costumes .
in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already handle half of all orders .
Mo@@ dena P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze and embroi@@ dery together with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been depl@@ eted .
there are almost no private shops and also the wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
nowadays , the bulk commodity is produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively through chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date to Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the industry association is also trying to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains from the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since this year we have produced a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible products . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berg regional office of the West@@ säch@@ sische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - special@@ ising in embroi@@ dery and lace .
in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , it is necessary to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt .
therefore an existing design is often only slightly different to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ vit@@ alized the historic snow ball point .
the machine ch@@ okes little chi@@ cks at some places .
the P@@ lau@@ en gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ thing master Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; before I could do nothing with traditional P@@ lau@@ dry lace . &quot;
now she uses the top of the snow for her jewelry .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says .
it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and its surroundings and who like to have a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .

XI ur@@ ges to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy must open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping said on Tuesday , a group tas@@ ked with steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should be committed to attrac@@ ting foreign investment and know @-@ how and improving the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to promote start @-@ ups and drive reforms will bring new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i .
the management group has adopted a set of guidelines including a negative list to regulate the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of public utilities ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the residents reporting system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the statement , a list of neg@@ atives is created which identifies sectors and companies that do not come into question for investments . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the initiative is important since it has a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , ensuring a legal business environment and open the market more open , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also ease controls on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their businesses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law of the lawyers to guarantee their activities , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
the European Commission plans to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and thus to use a significantly higher dose of the nervous system to consumers .
the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which is present in the EU &apos;s working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies will be passed on with full force to pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt of F@@ ood@@ watch .
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limit values of the neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ in for large fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish are already so strongly charged with mercury that , on the basis of the currently applicable limit values , approximately 50 percent of the cat@@ ches must not be sold .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ eable .
in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to ag@@ grav@@ ate the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because smaller c@@ low@@ fish , such as car@@ p , are usually so low that they comply with the planned maximum values already today . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sin@@ king in Kl@@ einf@@ eld is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ di@@ ous distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolfgang sch@@ midt .
mercury is a heavy metal , highly toxic to humans , which accum@@ ulates strongly over the food chain , especially in pre@@ dat@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; small quantities can already cause damage to the nervous system particularly in un@@ born damage . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not to be expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment especially through coal combustion .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants run more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warning of mercury in fish has already been among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
