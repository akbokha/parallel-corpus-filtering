C ) The Director General shall immediately notify all Member States of the Organization of any amend@@ ment to this Convention .
a ) This Convention shall enter into force on the day when the organization of the Community and the States ob@@ tains the written notification that their procedures are concluded for entry into force .
B ) This Convention shall remain in force as long as the States Parties to the Treaty are .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures .
the aim of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ r@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of premature discovery .
to mention the objective defined in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , verb@@ ati@@ fication with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures .
the technical conclusion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity specified for each material balance zone is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified me@@ gen .
in carrying out their re@@ visions , the Organisation according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Core Materials pursuant to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the use of their safegu@@ ards , the Community will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and they , as far as necessary , see how they are defined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of the received , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise derived core material and stocks ;
B ) assessment of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) Proced@@ ure for determining , evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) Proced@@ ure for ass@@ essing the accumulation of un@@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
F ) a protocol and reporting system , which as@@ signs the core material stock and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone , including the input and output of the material balance zone ;
g ) precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures pursuant to this Convention shall not extend to material in the mining industry or in ore processing .
B ) will introduce ur@@ an@@ - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material , which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) has not yet reached , into the States , so the community of the organization shares the amount and composition of the material , provided it is not introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) the core material , which is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ op@@ ic enrich@@ ment , leaves the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the States in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system , so it is subject to the other securing measures outlined in this Convention .
a ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , if the provisions stipulated in Article 11 are not permitted , however , the Community is not possible or desired for rec@@ lam@@ ation pursuant to this Convention , so the organisation and the community should consult each other about the use of suitable preventive measures .
B ) The preventive measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the community are unanim@@ ously determined that this core material is virtually non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able .
on the request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the safegu@@ ards under this agreement :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Core material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities under Article 13 , if such material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % .
on the request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the core material that would otherwise be subject to safegu@@ ards under this Convention , provided that the total material quantity delivered in the States is at no point in no time than
a ) a total of one kilogram of special foldable material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) Uran@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) Ur@@ an , with an enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of Natur@@ ur@@ an , is calculated by multi@@ pl@@ ying its weight with the five @-@ colour square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if liber@@ ated nuclear material is to be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the safegu@@ ards under this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material .
the Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements which are necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention , in particular as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention shall be applied .
the supplementary agreements can be expanded or changed without changing this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community .
the supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention . the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can come into effect within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of the Convention ; an extension of this period requires the inclusion of the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62 , the organisation provides a summ@@ arized inventory of the core material contained in the United States , not@@ withstanding its origin , and continues to carry out this inventory as a result of the following reports and the results of their investigations .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organization )
the EW@@ G has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general res@@ sour@@ ced problems .
C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal .
( D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the medium ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
for this purpose , the organisation of the EEC has presented a table , which is intended to apply in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement -
the organisation direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; special action account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special action account in accordance with this Agreement ; this property is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; by the organization , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement .
the special transaction account is separated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest debts of the member state , which are payable upon request in the currency of the State in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) Payment shall be made in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . of the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administr@@ ative Court ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to the 1st January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the EEC and the ste@@ wards under consideration of the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments against the above dates upon request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator accepts about proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner .
in the case of granting these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ eeable economic problems ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit @-@ raising capacity to loan terms without reductions ; and
VII ) the scope in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and swi@@ f@@ tly rep@@ ay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organization &apos;s loan program or not , according to procedures and practices , which are considered , approved and managed for the proper funding of the organization funded by the organization , with the aim of the pre@@ am@@ ble to be taken into account by the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of any financial means of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the organization which is bound in the context of a loan or loan for a programme or project which has already been approved by the Bank or the Organisation on the day of the entry into force of this agreement .
apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which are generally applicable for the development loans granted by the Organisation ; consequently , they are ref@@ und@@ able in ten years of age in 50 years .
special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this supply are to be made directly to the organisation it retains .
each special transaction loan is to be interpreted through a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which in particular the source of the funds is given .
the proceeds from each special transaction loan may be used for expenses in the recipient country &apos;s currency or for goods or services manufactured or used ( ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who , in accordance with what the administrator defined at the time of the loan guarantee , may be recipients of a special transaction loan .
capital rep@@ ay@@ ments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account , and in this way the amount returned in the currency of a member state shall be returned to the Member State as soon as possible by the administrator .
the car@@ et@@ aker teaches the EEC concerning the projects and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the complete awar@@ ding of all special transaction loans to the EEC concerning the projects and programmes approved by the directors .
during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the administrator will inform the EE@@ G quarter@@ ly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this .
as soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization , the administrator transm@@ its a detailed billing of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external audi@@ tor of the organisation to this account conclusion as soon as possible .
after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EE@@ G will report a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible .
the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts paid out of the account , and the amounts paid out of the account and the rep@@ ay@@ ments to the Member States are apparent .
the EEC and the ste@@ wards work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administrator until the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action bodies , and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organisation if necessary , the agreement and all obligations arising from it shall be due to immediate effect .
if the total amount of the capital paid by the recipients is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural regulations of each party .
the governments of the Member States noti@@ fies the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat passes these noti@@ fications together with a notification about the regular approval of this agreement by the EEC on the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization .
this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby each word is equally binding .
whereas the agreement in the form of a letter change to change the Annex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded - H@@ AT issued the following statement :

I be@@ g you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and propose to you as an appointment for the entry into force of 1 January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you confirm your government &apos;s consent to the above .
I honor to confirm you the receipt of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you confirm your government &apos;s consent to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit transactions with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make an appropriate request .
the agreements may be concluded up to the total amount owed by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion of the invoice units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery positions of the member states .
even now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be prepared .
with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially take over a commitment for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als without it being exceeded for a total of five years .
in the opening of the loans as well as for any extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws will not be made prior to exp@@ iry of the Stand@@ by agreement so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity .
the draws would take place in the BI@@ S at the conclusion of the agreement at available currencies , very likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods under consideration of the means of the Bank , expected to be three or six months .
the terms would correspond to those used by BI@@ S at the time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .
however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary means by itself on the market , the interest rate at the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin .
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries if the banks make an appropriate request . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am sending you the consent of the Council of the European Communities to the content of this writing .
convinced that stronger international cooperation should be carried out in such a way that greater liber@@ alisation , stability and expansion in international trade with meat and living animals is contributed ;
taking into account the need to avoid serious disturbances in international trade with beef and living cattle ;
in DER ER@@ K@@ EN@@ NT@@ NIS the importance of the production of beef and living cattle and trade with these products for the economy of many countries , in particular particular developing countries and developing countries ;

following the entry into force of the Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention .
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the members of the Council and the accompanying states a ) the time of the entry into force of this Convention and the names of the members who have signed or rati@@ fied or rati@@ fied it without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval ;
each contracting party can termin@@ ate this Convention by indicating a period of one year by advertisement to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe .
a reag@@ ent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood tests that contain the an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
if a reag@@ ent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) here@@ tical properties ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent to be examined for double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of the blood cells flow in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other reag@@ ents to be used on object bear@@ ers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has set up international standards for anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ completely anti @-@ D reag@@ ents for blood group determination , and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity , standards are currently being elabor@@ ated .
according to definition , an international standard supplement contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .
( 1 ) The effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ates is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ ter , which is observed in a series of di@@ lution in an er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic flood .
the ti@@ ter gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mixture within a series , in which a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
the effectiveness of reag@@ ents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as incomplete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of unknown reag@@ ent compared to the International Standard Prepar@@ ation or a state standard preparation in international units ( See Bulletin , O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) .
if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ears contain 256 international units per ml according to definition .
the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen .
the following table shows an example of comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International Standard serum Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A reag@@ ent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; P@@ IC FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 4@@ 50@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
if a reag@@ ent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties should remain for at least one year .
the exp@@ iry date of a reag@@ ent in liquid form according to the label lies at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date given on the label for dry reag@@ ents depends on the results of the exp@@ ir@@ ation attempts ; it must be approved by the state regul@@ ators .
dried reag@@ ents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container where they have been dried and which is closed so that no moisture can enter .
a dry reag@@ ent may only lose 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or@@ ical pent@@ oxi@@ des in a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the reag@@ ent ( or the solvents supplied with the dry reag@@ ents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the reag@@ ent with the added substance continues to satisfy the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness .
sera human origin for blood group determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml of fluid or re@@ dissolved serum .
the reag@@ ents , whether in liquid form or after re @-@ dissolution , must be transparent and must not contain any sedi@@ ments or gels or visible particles .
the reag@@ ents used for the international exchange for blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has come about through a unified system .
reag@@ ents for blood group determination are to be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the reag@@ ent in a container is sufficient not only to carry out tests with unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the effectiveness tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has to conduct written records of all stages of production and checks of reag@@ ents for blood group determination .
adequate samples of all reag@@ ents given are to be kept from the laboratory for a long time , until it is likely to be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
reag@@ ents used for blood group determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent an effective part , the others are the necessary aids to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain stability of the reag@@ ent .
for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided into three groups according to the origin of their effective part .
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal reag@@ ents cannot contain substances of human origin .
a black and white printed label can be attached to each individual container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer ,
4. the amount or , with dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions attached to the containers must contain the following information : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer ,
3. the quantity or , in the case of dried reag@@ ents , the amount and composition of the liquid required for re@@ plen@@ ishing ,
each shipment must be accompanied by a certificate in accordance with Article 4 of the Convention according to the Annex to this Protocol .

the mol@@ ds associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are authorised by means of a single paper document to be used in Annex I to this Convention .
the single paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import .
- in order to carry out the legal provisions applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in the sole use of the entry paper ;
- to be requested by the parties so that they may come to the request in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief .
( 1 ) This Convention does not prevent the contracting parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for the parties involved .
( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not to be submitted to a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete application may be allowed .
in these cases , registration must be made subsequently , upon which the competent authorities will be able to negotiate a peri@@ odic registration agreement within the time appointed by the authorities .
in cases of paragraph 1 , it may be allowed to use trading papers instead of the entry paper .

protocol to the 1979 Convention on temporary barrier @-@ provo@@ king air pollution concerning the fight against emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gra@@ zing river
concerned that the current emissions of air @-@ poll@@ uting substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America cause damage to natural resources of vital importance for the environment and the economy ,
the fact that the executive body for the Convention on its second session has acknowledged the need to effectively reduce the annual overall emissions of nit@@ ric oxi@@ des from stationary and movable sources or their gr@@ en@@ fe@@ ver@@ ting flow until 1995 , and the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions , retain their emissions limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des .
taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and impacts of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their consequ@@ ent products to the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions ,
determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gra@@ zing river , especially by applying appropriate national emission limits for new mobile major sources and by retro@@ fitting existing larger stationary sources ,
in the realisation that the scientific and technical knowledge of these questions will further develop and that this development must be taken into account in the examination of the application of this protocol and in the decision on further measures ,
recogni@@ zing that the elabor@@ ation of a solution based on critical stress has the aim of establishing an impact @-@ oriented scientific basis , which is to be taken into account when checking the application of this protocol and in deciding on further internationally agreed measures ,
recogni@@ zing that the relevant testing of procedures for creating more favourable conditions for a technology exchange will contribute to an effective reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des in the Commission &apos;s region ,
taking note of the fact that several states have committed to each other to reduce their annual national emissions of nit@@ ric oxi@@ des in@@ ad@@ missible and to a considerable extent ,
