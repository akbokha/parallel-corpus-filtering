<seg id="649">B) i) The organization only requires the minimum amount of information and data, which is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="650">II) Information on investments will be limited to the minimum required for the use of safety measures in relation to core material, which is subject to the safeguards under this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="651">C) The organization is ready to establish investment data, which considers the community to be particularly vulnerable, in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="652">These data do not need to be materially transferred to the organization, provided that they remain accessible for further testing by the organization in the premises of the community.</seg>
<seg id="653">(a) i) The organization fetches the consent of the community and states to the designation of inspectors for the states.</seg>
<seg id="654">II) Reduces the Community either against a proposed naming or at any point against a subsequent naming, so the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denominations.</seg>
<seg id="655">III) As a result of the repeated refusal of the Community to approve the designation of inspectors of the organization which are impeded by this Convention, the Council will denounce the refusal after the General Director of the Organization - hereinafter referred to as "the Director-General" - will discuss with the aim of meeting appropriate measures.</seg>
<seg id="656">B) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspectors of the organization are actually able to perform the tasks assigned to them according to their agreement.</seg>
<seg id="657">C) The visits and activities of the inspectors of the organization are arranged in such a way that i) are as small as possible for the possible harassment and disruption to the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities that are subject to inspection;</seg>
<seg id="658">II) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information provided to the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="659">Each state applies to the organization, including its assets, funds and assets, as well as to its inspectors and other officials, the tasks according to this Convention, the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the Privileges and Liberation of the International Atomic Energy Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="660">The safeguards under this agreement are terminated with regard to core material when the community and the organisation determine that the material has been consumed or diluted in a manner that it is no longer useable for nuclear activity, which is under the point of view of the securing measures of concern, or has become virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="661">In accordance with this Convention, the Community notifies the organization of the transfer of nuclear material from the states, which is subject to the security measures pursuant to this Convention.</seg>

<seg id="668">In any case, the safeguards provided in this Convention are re-used once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity.</seg>
<seg id="669">The organisation is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of the material in the concerned state or the states concerned and on any transfer of such material from this state or these states.</seg>
<seg id="670">This explains their agreement as soon as possible; it only covers issues such as temporal and procedural rules and agreements for reporting, but does not include an endorsement or a secret knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the success of the core material.</seg>
<seg id="671">The organisation, the community and the states bear the costs incurred by each of them in carrying out their respective obligations under this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="672">If the community, the states or persons subject to their jurisdiction, but extraordinary costs resulting from a special request of the organization, the organisation will reimburse these costs, provided that it has become available in advance.</seg>
<seg id="673">In any case, the organisation bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspectors of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="674">The Community and the States ensure that the liability protection for nuclear damages, including insurance or other financial security, may be used in accordance with its laws and other regulations, to the organisation and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention as well as to the nationals of the states.</seg>
<seg id="675">Any claim that the community or the government vis-à-vis the organization or the organization towards the Community or a State for damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident - is governed by the implementation of the safeguards under this Convention, is regulated in accordance with international law.</seg>
<seg id="676">If the Council determines the factual information presented by the Director General by the Director General, that the organization has not been able to verify itself through review, that no core material that must be subject to security measures pursuant to this Convention shall be reimbursed for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosions, and if necessary take the other measures envisaged there.</seg>
<seg id="677">In such steps, the Council, in which mass has been achieved by the applied securing measures, takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is affected - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security.</seg>
<seg id="678">On request of the organization, the community or a state, consultations on questions arise which arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="679">The Community and the States are entitled to request that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be examined by the Council.</seg>
<seg id="680">The Council invites the community and the concerned state to participate in the discussion of such issues by the Council.</seg>

<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the Convention is to specify the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures.</seg>
<seg id="696">The aim of the preventive measures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the branching of significant quantities of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosives for unknown purposes, as well as deterrence from such a junction by the risk of premature discovery.</seg>
<seg id="697">To mention the objective defined in Article 28, material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, verbatification with spatial integration and observation as important complementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical conclusion of the inspections by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity specified for each material balance zone is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified megen.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their revisions, the Organisation according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the Community.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Core Materials pursuant to this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the use of their safeguards, the Community will make use of the methods and measures of the following kind and they, as far as necessary, see how they are defined and useful in the supplementary agreements:</seg>
<seg id="702">A) a measurement system to determine the quantities of the received, manufactured, lost, lost or otherwise derived core material and stocks;</seg>
<seg id="703">B) assessment of reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty;</seg>
<seg id="704">C) Procedure for determining, evaluating and evaluating differences in the measurements of sender and recipient;</seg>
<seg id="705">E) Procedure for assessing the accumulation of unmeasured stocks and non-measured losses;</seg>
<seg id="706">F) a protocol and reporting system, which assigns the core material stock and the changes in the material balance zone for each material balance zone, including the input and output of the material balance zone;</seg>
<seg id="707">G) precautions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly;</seg>
<seg id="708">H) Procedure for the reimbursement of reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The securing measures pursuant to this Convention shall not extend to material in the mining industry or in ore processing.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) will introduce uran- or thoriumous material, which the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c) has not yet reached, into the States, so the community of the organization shares the amount and composition of the material, provided it is not introduced for specifically non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) the core material, which is suitable for fuel production or isotopic enrichment, leaves the plant or process phase in which it is manufactured or is introduced into the States in a later phase of the nuclear fuel circulation system, so it is subject to the other securing measures outlined in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The preventive measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11. however, if the provisions stipulated in Article 11 are not permitted, however, the Community is not possible or desired for reclamation pursuant to this Convention, so the organisation and the community should consult each other about the use of suitable preventive measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The preventive measures envisaged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13, provided that the organisation and the community are unanimously determined that this core material is virtually non-recoverable.</seg>
<seg id="714">On the request of the Community, the organisation frees the following core material from the safeguards under this agreement:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) Core material, if it is used in non-nuclear activities under Article 13, if such material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with a isotope concentration of Plutonium-238, which is above 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">On the request of the Community, the organization frees the core material that would otherwise be subject to safeguards under this Convention, provided that the total material quantity delivered in the States is at no point in no time than</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram of special foldable material, which can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>
<seg id="720">II) Uranium with an enrichment of 0.2 (20%) and above, calculated by multiplying its weight with enrichment,</seg>
<seg id="721">III) Uran, with an enrichment, which is below 0.2 (20%) and above that of Natururan, is calculated by multiplying its weight with the five-colour square of the enrichment;</seg>
<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If liberated nuclear material is to be processed or stored together with the core material that is subject to the safeguards under this Convention, precautions are taken for the reuse of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements which are necessary for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention, in particular as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention shall be applied.</seg>
<seg id="726">The supplementary agreements can be expanded or changed without changing this Convention in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The supplementary agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this Convention. the organisation, the community and the states undertake all efforts so that these agreements can come into effect within ninety days after the entry into force of the Convention; an extension of this period requires the inclusion of the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report referred to in Article 62, the organisation provides a summarized inventory of the core material contained in the United States, notwithstanding its origin, and continues to carry out this inventory as a result of the following reports and the results of their investigations.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organization)</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the International Economic Cooperation Conference to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is hindered by general ressourced problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months following the entry into force of the agreement and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans, and the organization will do its best to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">(D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the medium ties to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">For this purpose, the organisation of the EEC has presented a table, which is intended to apply in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this Agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The organisation directs a special account under the name "special action account" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the special action account in accordance with this Agreement; this property is referred to as "administrator" by the organization, only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The special transaction account is separated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non-interest debts of the member state, which are payable upon request in the currency of the State in order of the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment shall be made in two installments, and i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. of the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Administrative Court;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remainder of the contribution to the 1st January 1979 or at a different time agreed between the EEC and the stewards under consideration of the deadlines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may make payments against the above dates upon request.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator accepts about proportionate drawing on the cash or the notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction loan and to balance the special transaction account in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">In the case of granting these loans, the caretaker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent in which international economic factors have contributed to the country's current and foreseeable economic problems;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its additional credit-raising capacity to loan terms without reductions; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) the scope in which the problems of the affected countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and swiftly repayable development program or project (including a sectoral project), regardless of whether it is part of the organization's loan program or not, according to procedures and practices, which are considered, approved and managed for the proper funding of the organization funded by the organization, with the aim of the preamble to be taken into account by the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of any financial means of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the organization which is bound in the context of a loan or loan for a programme or project which has already been approved by the Bank or the Organisation on the day of the entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">Apart from Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions, which are generally applicable for the development loans granted by the Organisation; consequently, they are refundable in ten years of age in 50 years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Special transactions are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts for payment of this supply are to be made directly to the organisation it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction loan is to be interpreted through a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator in which in particular the source of the funds is given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The proceeds from each special transaction loan may be used for expenses in the recipient country's currency or for goods or services manufactured or used (ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and who, in accordance with what the administrator defined at the time of the loan guarantee, may be recipients of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments from a special transaction loan are made to the special transaction account, and in this way the amount returned in the currency of a member state shall be returned to the Member State as soon as possible by the administrator.</seg>
<seg id="753">The caretaker teaches the EEC concerning the projects and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the complete awarding of all special transaction loans to the EEC concerning the projects and programmes approved by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loan, the administrator will inform the EEG quarterly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible after the end of the financial year of the organization, the administrator transmits a detailed billing of the special transaction account with an opinion from the external auditor of the organisation to this account conclusion as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the special transaction loan, the administrator of the EEG will report a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and executes appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts paid out of the account, and the amounts paid out of the account and the repayments to the Member States are apparent.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the stewards work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">For this purpose, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the administrator until the full edition of the funds of the special transaction account from time to time have an exchange of ideas about the status of the special transaction account, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action bodies, and on all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date, which the EEC and the Organisation if necessary, the agreement and all obligations arising from it shall be due to immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="761">If the total amount of the capital paid by the recipients is repaid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and remitted to the Member States, this agreement and all obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect.</seg>
<seg id="762">This agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC as per the procedural regulations of each party.</seg>
<seg id="763">The governments of the Member States notifies the Secretariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the procedures concerned.</seg>
<seg id="764">The Secretariat passes these notifications together with a notification about the regular approval of this agreement by the EEC on the Organization.</seg>
<seg id="765">This agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization.</seg>
<seg id="766">This agreement is written in two documents in Danish, German, English, French, Italian and Dutch, whereby each word is equally binding.</seg>

<seg id="788">- to monitor the development of research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="789">Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Euratom Programme - hereinafter called "VG."</seg>
<seg id="790">The VG, who has the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Euratom Programme, perceives this task with regard to all research and development activities related to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="791">In particular, it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and aligns its T * iness in the interests of the two contracting parties to the common goal defined in the Euratom Programme and in the Swiss program, as well as the common goal defined in Article 1 of the present agreement, whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are duly considered.</seg>
<seg id="792">Pursuant to its Rules of Procedure, the VG appoints one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the framework of the Euratom Programme, whenever the competent Swiss authorities are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="793">The councils, which the VG research proposals provide with regard to the fact that the funds granted for the Euratom programme provide the best possible scientific results, take this task with regard to all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="794">Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the participating laboratories within the framework of the Euratom Programme.</seg>
<seg id="795">The committee of directors to supervise the implementation of the Euratom Programme and who is responsible for making optimal use of the capacities of the laboratories, which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme, will accomplish this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement.</seg>
