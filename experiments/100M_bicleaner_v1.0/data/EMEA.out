this document is a summary of the European Public Research Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package template ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ elessly thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alter@@ nat@@ ely with periods of normal mood .
abili@@ fy is used to treat mild to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for rapid control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders if oral consumption of the drug is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for inser@@ ting or treatment tablets in patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing pills .
for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as A@@ bili@@ fy , the dose should be adjusted by A@@ bili@@ fy .
this imp@@ airs signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells among themselves .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as &quot; partial Ag@@ on@@ ist &quot; for recept@@ ors for neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole works like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but to a lesser extent as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize brain activity , thereby reducing psycho@@ tic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their re@@ occurrence .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study A@@ bili@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ r@@ ence , compared to 160 patients with which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy .
the efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared with Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psycho@@ tic ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies , the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to take away ( absor@@ bs ) .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than those receiving placebo .
when applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo .
A@@ bili@@ fy also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo to re@@ play man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment .
A@@ bili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy for intake ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( nausea ) , nausea , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disturbances ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and where the man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l prevail over the risks .
furthermore , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased un@@ rest and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with chronic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weigh the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the placing of A@@ bili@@ fy in the entire European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of severe to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , independent of meals .
increased efficacy in dos@@ ages of 15 mg over a daily dose was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for A@@ bili@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behaviour is part of psycho@@ tic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after the on@@ set or after a replacement of anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy , even in cases of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psycho@@ tics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including accum@@ ul@@ ating and mal@@ ignant form ) .
3 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials , which lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
if an A@@ bili@@ fy treated patient signs signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a M@@ NS or uncle@@ ar high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti@@ psycho@@ tics , including A@@ bili@@ fy , must be deposited .
therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is or in states related to sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo .
there was , however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs , including A@@ bili@@ fy .
there are no exact risk estimates for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events in patients treated with A@@ bili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psycho@@ tic drugs that permit direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ meri@@ tis , poly@@ ur@@ ic , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
considering the joint administration of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with A@@ bili@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with A@@ bili@@ fy can be administered with a moderate increase in ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( war@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phi@@ c ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of the human being and the concerns raised in the reproductive studies of the animal , this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk of the fet@@ us .
however , as with other anti@@ psycho@@ tics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a overall lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia compared to patients treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ treatment .
in another study for 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those of lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and their incidence of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ignant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dosing with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death .
there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma mic@@ rot@@ ein binding .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , for ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , for alpha @-@ 1 adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in dosage of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron @-@ emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ ty .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current measured values defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ sign@@ - Depres@@ sions@@ Rate Scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ia trials with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar I error , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mono@@ therapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic tra@@ its , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a effectiveness against placebo in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
in Week 12 , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which sometimes did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase of 74 weeks for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a back into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in extensive metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ related effects .
a pop @-@ up @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics resulted in no indication of clin@@ ically significant differences in the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of the liver function to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and can@@ did@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no importance for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 10@@ times the middle Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans .
a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ atives of the hydro@@ xy@@ - met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the average dose of the recommended dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro solu@@ bility .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

15 late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder - in a controlled study about 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ -
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine 2 and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
97 Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo in a placebo @-@ controlled mono@@ therap@@ ic study of 3 weeks with fixed dose involving a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study , which compared the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l as a solution for taking 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in healthy subjects , the ratio was between the geometric C@@ max average value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) .

in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with chronic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the absorption and to minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended in the b@@ ypass of obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ ut therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if any further oral treatment is index@@ ed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , see the summary of the features of the medicine to A@@ bili@@ fy tablets , A@@ bili@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or A@@ bili@@ fy solution for taking .
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l inj@@ ections in patients with ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which have been differently caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ disp@@ ose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including accum@@ ul@@ ating and mal@@ ignant form ) .
late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia occurring during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing planes of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ) .
poly@@ meri@@ tis , poly@@ ur@@ ic , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ic and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored in terms of wor@@ sen@@ ing glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psycho@@ tics , in which weight gain is known as side effect or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ y@@ les and could lead to serious complications .
nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) were applied as one @-@ time intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and the simultaneously Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) were in@@ tra @-@ muscular .
105 The H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy should be raised to the dose height before starting the ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular were the intensity of se@@ dation larger compared with the following all@@ usion of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the following side effects were reported more frequently in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those of lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred , showed no medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases of CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
adverse events related to anti@@ psycho@@ tic therapy and their incidence of treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ignant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ ines@@ ia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significantly greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms of det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the mean improvement from initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement component score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5,@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe det@@ achment , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected because of a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term trials ( 4 to 6 weeks ) on 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psycho@@ tic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ der patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
current measured values defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ Depres@@ sions@@ roasted scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher decrease in the return rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ lanz@@ ap@@ in @-@ controlled , multinational double blind study in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks involving 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study goal was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg ) with an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psycho@@ tic characteristics , which partly did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar decline , mainly in the prevention of a reg@@ ression into man@@ ia .
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , after administration of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time was up to 1 to 3 hours after reaching the maximum plasma cone .
the application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application for systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity following IV application no safety @-@ relevant concerns were found after mat@@ ernal exposure , the 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on the conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and for can@@ did@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so that they have only limited or no importance for clinical application .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent side @-@ kidney toxic@@ ity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equal to 10 times the mean steady state @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ g@@ atives of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the mid @-@ steady state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , about three quarters of which had previously received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in the sole dose or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing drug ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane spoke to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel chemotherapy .
if one considers only the patients treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to wor@@ sen@@ ing disease and survival .
in contrast to these indicators , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing medicines .
it may not be used in patients who breast@@ feed or have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before the treatment begins .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) stated that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel containing medicines and that in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel contained medicines it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ anes throughout the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mono@@ therapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ rop@@ athy &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
in sensory Neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 , treatment can be interrupted until a recovery is reached on degrees 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel , which may have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a sympt@@ om@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient may not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again .
in patients no further abrasion cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a clearly associated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity is not proven with Abra@@ x@@ ane , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diarr@@ ho@@ ea in the patients following the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is inevitable .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ tion method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of spar@@ ing prior to treatment , because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the traffic ability and the ability to operate machinery .
listed below are the most common and major incidents of adverse events that occurred in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the pi@@ vot@@ al Phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most con@@ spic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed at 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10.000 ) .
occasionally : elevated blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tic hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 7@@ 89 patients
since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual incidence were possible and there was no caus@@ al connection with these events .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti@@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the incorpor@@ ation of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tube indi@@ genes and stabili@@ zes mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation results in an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ u@@ bular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in conve@@ ys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into the endo@@ thel@@ ial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel by endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ th@@ eli@@ als transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 &apos;s alb@@ umin@@ ous receptor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel @-@ accumulation in the area of the tumor .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ armed investig@@ ational studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III trial study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 .
in the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer .
this multic@@ entre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel every 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with pre@@ medi@@ ation to prevent an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medit@@ ation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a dist@@ ressing general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had only ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metastatic disease and 19 % due to metastatic disease and ad@@ ju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression free survival and survival for patients receiving first @-@ line therapy are explained below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy Grade 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy at bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
active ingredient exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml in an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After IV administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the medium distribution volume amounted to 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching ex@@ trav@@ ascular distribution and / or soft distribution of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane according to a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel .
the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane dosage ( 43 % ) compared to a solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel injection , and the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ axel is mainly metaboli@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the average total dose for cum@@ ulative ur@@ ic ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the total dose with less than 1 % of the Met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel .
however , only a few data are available to patients aged over 75 years , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti @-@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be cau@@ tious when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , a 10 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is slowly inj@@ ected over a period of at least 1 minute ( 0.@@ 9 % ) .
after full en@@ core of the solution , the water bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the water bottle should be swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until a complete res@@ us@@ bed of the powder is done .
if precip@@ itations or sin@@ king substances are visible , the pier@@ cing bottle has to be gently inver@@ ted to achieve a complete res@@ us@@ pension before applying .

member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market before the market launch provides medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing supplement . • With unique imaging of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patient .
this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same substance ( also called &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; ) .
it is used in patients with normal blood pressure values in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion if a blood trans@@ fusion is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that the medicine is shown .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients wanting to make a blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the inj@@ ections can also be carried out by the patient or his supervis@@ or , provided they have received adequate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams a dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be monitored before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ etal deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers the formation of epo@@ etin al@@ fa .
Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug compared to a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from ren@@ al problems caused by kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of Ab@@ se@@ amed inj@@ ected under the skin with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy .
in the study with patients suffering from ren@@ al problems caused by kidney problems , the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same degree as those who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
compared to this , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0,@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ inging mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ etin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
Ab@@ se@@ amed as an injection underneath the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the requirements of the European Union the evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company that produces ab@@ se@@ amed will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug .
in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG to transport Ab@@ se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion demand in adults with solid tum@@ ours , mal@@ ignant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is based on the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ spar@@ ing measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood flow rate ( 4 or more units blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) .
for the reduction of external blood Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large electro @-@ orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , where high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ at@@ ric patients , where the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ tions may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
an increase in ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed in a patient or below the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration .
given this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) of up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ etin al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ etin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permissible dose required for controlling an@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ E. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) .
an@@ emia symptoms and - consequ@@ ential effects may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician .
given this h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) of up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ etin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permissible dose required for control of an@@ emia symptoms .
if after 4 weeks of h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value equal to at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number has increased by ≥ 4@@ 0,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .

patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , where the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood kon@@ ser@@ ae is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed should receive a body weight of 600 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure .
the iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program began , so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ E. / kg epo@@ etin al@@ fa which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
in this case , epo@@ etin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation .
patients who suffer from any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin at a er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ oph@@ en@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive an ab@@ se@@ amed or another er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
the application of epo@@ etin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients suffering from an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the oti@@ d or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recent heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ oph@@ en@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ an@@ em er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
in patients with sudden loss of activity , defined as reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes of failure ( iron , foli@@ c acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umini@@ umin@@ ous toxic@@ ity , infections or inflammation , blood loss and ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined .
if the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ u@@ lo@@ yte &quot; index &quot; ) , is reduced ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20,000 / micro@@ litre or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row should be considered for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA .
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
in clinical trials , an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the administration of epo@@ etin if the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased via the concentration required for the control of the an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of high blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evi@@ d@@ ent coron@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , the upper limit of the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ etin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients receiving chemotherapy , epo@@ etin al@@ fa should be considered a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ etin al@@ fa and er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin response ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a b @-@ value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ mbo@@ tic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chem@@ o@@ therap@@ ic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the respective patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
for patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ etin al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ mbo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , an increased risk of post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic / vascular events may not be excluded in case of treatment with epo@@ etin al@@ fa for patients with an initial h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled trials , epo@@ etin was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with sympt@@ om@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tumour progression .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , when a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
if epo@@ etin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dosage should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit .
in vitro studies on tumour tissue there are no indications of an interaction between epo@@ etin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation .
thro@@ mbo@@ tic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ emia , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ ral thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s , retin@@ al@@ thro@@ mbo@@ sis , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin therapy , as well as patients under epo@@ etin al@@ fa .
the most frequent side effect during treatment with epo@@ etin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin therapy , it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ mbo@@ tic and vascular complications .
the genetically recovered epo@@ etin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ sili@@ sed and the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content are identical to the endo@@ genous er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells that epo@@ etin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ ovi@@ esis .

survival and progression progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed consistent , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality due to various common mal@@ ign@@ omas than in the controls .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ sis and associated complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
there is an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded .
it is not clear how far these results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of obtaining a ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the verified data .
epo@@ etin al@@ fa @-@ regulations after a repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ etin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last administration .

prior to the market launch and in accordance with the agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the holder of the transport company has to provide the medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the product ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing supplement .
the holder of the licensing agreement has to ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 is furnished and functional in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application form before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the medicine is used in the transport .
the holder of the licensing agreement comm@@ its itself to the trials and additional measures outlined in the Pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan as outlined in Version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as to carry out the update of the Risk Management Plan pursuant to each subsequent update of the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use &quot; at the same time with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • On the receipt of new information , the impact on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the measures to reduce risk • within 60 days after reaching an important ( pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by the E@@ MEA ( E@@ MEA )
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within one month before your treatment , if you suffer from an un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( first occurring or reinforced chest pain ) , the risk of blood @-@ graf@@ ting in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis ) exists - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occurred
they suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervi@@ x ( vascular disease of the oti@@ d ) or brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) .
during treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ el@@ ets can occur within the normal range , which re@@ forms in further treatment .
your doctor may carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
iron deficiency , dis@@ solving red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or foli@@ c acid deficiency , should be considered and treated with Ab@@ se@@ amed before the start of therapy .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti @-@ body @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ oph@@ en@@ ia after mon@@ ate@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ en@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is treated best .
therefore , Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death can be increased .
in case of increased or increasing potassium content , your doctor may consider an interruption of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the levels of potassium are back in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease or storage signs due to insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
according to the present findings , the treatment of the blood pressure with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are still not di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ etin al@@ fa administration and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your levels of red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minim@@ ise the risk of blood graf@@ ting ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic event ) .
this risk should be weigh@@ ed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ etin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past are already thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bo@@ li@@ sm ) .
if you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed can act like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumor .
if you prefer a major orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , you should investigate the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before the start of treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after the surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / apply other medicines or have been used / used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs .
if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may also arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ etin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are means to build up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your blood pressure ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure the drug works correctly and your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you get regular doses of ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ E. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that your h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how an@@ a@@ emia refers to treatment , the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
to ensure this and ensure that the h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor treating the ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in will carry out regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor thinks this is appropriate for you , also learn how to spra@@ t Ab@@ se@@ amed itself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages , stro@@ kes , temporary circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mbo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ mbo@@ sis , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mbo@@ sis , thro@@ mbo@@ sis ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s ) , thro@@ mbo@@ sis of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin therapy .
eyel@@ ids and lips ( Qu@@ in@@ cke eyel@@ ids ) and shock @-@ like allergic reactions with symptoms such as ting@@ ling , redness , it@@ ching , heat sensation , and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ oph@@ en@@ ia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using Ab@@ se@@ amed &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations it can come - regardless of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed - to a drop of blood ( thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) .
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed can be associated with increased risk of blood pro@@ p after surgery ( post @-@ operative thro@@ mbo@@ tic vascular events ) when your initial h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in value is too high

Ac@@ up@@ a is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like in H@@ inf@@ all ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ up@@ a may reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ cur@@ a may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease .
as the active ingredient in Ac@@ up@@ a is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a portion of the data material for z@@ omet@@ a was used to assess Ac@@ up@@ a .
in the first study , nearly 8@@ ,000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis were involved , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who recently had a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was examined over a period of up to five years .
in Pa@@ get , Ac@@ up@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
main indicator of the efficacy was whether the sal@@ ine of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood re @-@ norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study with older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ up@@ a ( without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ up@@ a ( with or without oste@@ opor@@ osis ) the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under Ac@@ up@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of Ac@@ up@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ up@@ a may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with ac@@ last@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion point and oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ up@@ a manufactures recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for doctors who prescri@@ be Ac@@ up@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information on how to apply the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit for the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ up@@ a in the entire European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment • in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk for frac@@ tures , including patients with a l@@ itt@@ y low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg ac@@ last@@ a is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ate is recommended for two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ cur@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
following a treatment by the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ up@@ a , a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ emental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a l@@ itt@@ y low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first acet@@ ate in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a may be reduced by using par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol .
patients with kidney function disorders ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min Ac@@ up@@ a is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available .
elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in elderly patients is similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ cur@@ a are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data is lacking for safety and efficacy .
Ac@@ up@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there are limited clinical experience for this patient population .
a pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is to be treated with acet@@ ate by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the start of the therapy ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ up@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of el@@ emental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( bad oral hygiene ) should be treated with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
for patients who need dental intervention , no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the treatment of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen can be reduced shortly after the use of acet@@ am@@ ol ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation reported as serious adverse effects was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to those receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ c@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) , the overall frequency of atri@@ al fibr@@ ill@@ ation between Ac@@ up@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) un@@ desirable drug interactions are listed in table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid was associated with ren@@ al dys@@ functions , which referred to as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the cre@@ atine clearance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable to the Ac@@ la@@ sta@@ - and placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a compared to 0.8 % of the patients treated with placebo .
based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic calcium values occurred below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , in 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study on the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a l@@ itt@@ l@@ itt@@ y hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the jaw area were frequently reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis , and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks .
7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients underwent oste@@ o@@ arthritis in the max@@ illary area of a patient treated with Ac@@ up@@ a and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the event of over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of acet@@ ate 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T score for the string neck ≤ -@@ 1.5 and at least two light or a medium @-@ heavy existing ed@@ dy body frac@@ ture or a BM@@ D @-@ T score for the string neck ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing ed@@ dy body frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures Ac@@ cur@@ a significantly decreased over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures after one year ( see table 2 ) .
Ac@@ up@@ a treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ cur@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) ac@@ last@@ a significantly increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ c acid , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase bone density of lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip increased by 6.@@ 0 % , the th@@ ig@@ h by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology in 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ up@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ sies from the pel@@ vic base .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase in the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone volume and the retention of the tra@@ bec@@ ular bone architecture compared to placebo .
bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in peri@@ odic intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5@@ mg dose of Ac@@ up@@ a was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the initial value of up to 36 months .
the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion .
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with Ac@@ up@@ a compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ up@@ a treatment increased BM@@ D compared to placebo treatment at the overall level and scar@@ ves at all times .
the Ac@@ up@@ a treatment led to an increase of BM@@ D by 5.4 % over 24 months compared to placebo treatment by 5.4 % in total weight and 4.3 % at the lower leg .
clinical efficacy in males In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ up@@ a @-@ treated males compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once @-@ weekly administration of Ac@@ up@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the initial value .
clinical efficacy of the treatment with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ up@@ a was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed , mostly light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( medi@@ an serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in accordance with 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.1 fold @-@ specific upper normal value when recording in the study ) .
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day during 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Ac@@ up@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study were eligible for follow @-@ up .
from the 143 with ac@@ last@@ a and the 107 patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic approach of 141 of patients treated with acet@@ ate could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
sing@@ ular and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ ed independent .
after that , the plasma levels quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .

the early stages of distribution ( α and β , with the above mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the fast res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose can be found in the urine , whereas the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
the total body @-@ clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
a reduced clearance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not metaboli@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , metabolic dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
specific patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clear@@ ance of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate kidney dysfunction down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid required .
since severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is only limited , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ Latvian intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and a body weight of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg for rats .
for studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ times of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid in rats , taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dosage that corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in accumulated ex@@ positions sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects occurred in other organs including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , as well as on the intraven@@ ous injection site .
the most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , an infection that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats one observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
in rab@@ bits no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the reduced serum @-@ calcium levels .

according to the CH@@ MP gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicine , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odic Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known to affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone was reached ( pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) . • On request of the E@@ MEA .
Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid is a representative of a class of substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the mortality of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , above all est@@ ro@@ gens that are made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is built in@@ subordin@@ ated , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ up@@ a works by norm@@ alising bone reconstruction , ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forces the bone again .
if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ up@@ a .
when using Ac@@ up@@ a with other medicines Please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been used / used recently , even if they are not prescription drugs .
for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking medicines that are known to harm the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ up@@ a along with food and drinks , you are concerned that you take enough fluids in accordance with the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with Ac@@ up@@ a .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , administered by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to admini@@ ster Ac@@ up@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ up@@ a works for a long period of time , you may need to take another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get Ac@@ cur@@ a can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a fails , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before completing the therapy with Ac@@ up@@ a Falls you are considering the completion of treatment with Ac@@ up@@ a , please take your next appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very frequently ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) , but are less frequent following the subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a .
at present it is uncle@@ ar whether Ac@@ up@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received Ac@@ up@@ a .

reported allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported .
please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed adverse effects may be impaired or you notice any side effects listed in this information .
if the medicine is not immediately used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the in@@ fusion of acet@@ ate can be carried out two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a patients have to be sufficiently supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid sett@@ ling of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes sympt@@ om@@ atic , hypo@@ the@@ y@@ an@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ up@@ a .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , corresponding to at least twice a day 500 mg of el@@ emental calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of Ac@@ up@@ a .
in patients with a recently developed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50.000 to 12@@ 5.000 I.@@ E. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ up@@ a .

A@@ compli@@ a is additionally used to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and in addition one or more I
in addition , four studies have been conducted to more than 7 000 patients in which A@@ compli@@ a was used as a supporting agent compared to placebo .
on the other hand , the studies on the setting of the smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ compli@@ a was difficult to assess in this field of application .
what is associated with A@@ compli@@ a ? the most common side effects of A@@ compli@@ a , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper air@@ we@@ ge@@ . n@@ g The complete listing of the side effects reported in connection with A@@ compli@@ a is to be found in the packing supplement .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from an existing severe depression or treated with anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants as it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .
caution is recommended while using A@@ compli@@ a with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for use in HIV infection ) , Tel@@ i@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the effectiveness of A@@ compli@@ a in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or over@@ weight

A@@ compli@@ a is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
La Depres@@ sive disorders or mood changes with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in an individual case out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
also in patients who - in addition to obesity in themselves - do not have any noticeable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur .
relatives or other nearby persons ) must point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately get medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• El@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .
Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , car@@ ob ( cab@@ bage ) has not been studied , is believed to be the simultaneous offering of potent C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tors the plasma concentration of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant
in addition , patients suffering from over@@ weight over@@ weight patients as well as in patients with obesity , and in addition 3@@ 800 patients in other indications .
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the adverse effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients treated for weight reduction and related metabolic diseases .
if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding plac@@ eb@@ or@@ ate ( for un@@ desirable effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for un@@ desirable effects &lt; 1 % ) .
very common ( ≥ 10 % ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 , &lt; 10 % ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 0.1 , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very rare
only slight symptoms were observed in a tolerance study in which a limited number of persons were administered up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia at the same time .
n weight reduction after one year amounted to 20 mg 6.5 kg , relative to the initial value , compared to 1.6 kilograms for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.3 ; -@@ 4.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ compli@@ a 20 mg and 1.2 kg in the placebo group ( difference -@@ 3.8 kg ; CI@@ 95 % -@@ 4,@@ 4 , -@@ 3,@@ 3 ; p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
after 2 years the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ compli@@ a and placebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3.4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
9 weight reduction and further risk factors In the studies in patients without diabetes , in which a mixed population of patients with
under Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg an average drop in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des was seen from 6.@@ 9 % ( initial tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride 1.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) compared to an increase of 5.@@ 8 %
in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) after 6 months -@@ 0.8 for both groups ) was 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo
the percentage of patients reaching a H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
the difference between the mean weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and about 50 % explained by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z
at least 2 hours , the steady state plasma levels were reached after 13 days ( C@@ max = 196 ± 28.@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; C@@ trou@@ gh = 9@@ 1,6 ± 14,@@ 1 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 = 29@@ 60 ± 26@@ 8 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml ) .
influence of food : he subjects who received Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant either in the so@@ bri@@ ber@@ nation or after a fat @-@ rich meal , had a 67 % increased C@@ max or 48 % increased n@@ g AU@@ C in case of food intake .
patients with black skin color can have up to 31 % lower C@@ max and a 43 % lower AU@@ C compared to other ethnic populations .
n popularity analysis ( age range 18@@ - 81 years ) is estimated that a 75 @-@ year @-@ old patient has a 21 % higher C@@ max and a 27 % higher AU@@ C than a 40 @-@ year @-@ old .
5.3 Pre @-@ clinical data on the safety of subsequent adverse events that were not observed in clinical trials , but were noted in animals following exposure in the human@@ istic area , were considered potentially relevant for clinical use :
in some , but not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions with stress @-@ related stress appears to be associated with the animals .
if Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period of time before the combination ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , no unwanted effects were observed on the fertility or cycle disturbances .
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o caused no changes in learning behaviour or memory .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Be@@ verage Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . it can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not shown .
in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially over@@ weight patients ) , it can be applied not satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily using met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dosage .
in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic acid or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic acid or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Ac@@ tos treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic acid or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapy was studied ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg in the case of dos@@ ages .
at the end of the trial , the effect of an additional dose of meth@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ y@@ lic acid in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values was 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study investigating the combination of ac@@ tos and insulin in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving ac@@ tos additionally showed a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo .
the most common adverse events related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ thes@@ i@@ ology ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high concentration of k@@ et@@ one - in the blood ) .
it was decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not shown .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit for the tak@@ eover of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union by Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white until whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is un@@ suitable for met@@ form@@ in due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
for use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients who are at least one risk factor ( e.g. heart attack or sympt@@ om@@ atic coron@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose step@@ wise .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or e@@ dem@@ a , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and e@@ dem@@ a when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular outcome study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease was performed .
in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased output of liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T mirrors are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal pain , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values are to be checked .
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be guided by clinical assessment to the outcome of the laboratory parameters .
in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that can move from fatty deposits and is associated with a fluid retention in some cases .
a slight reduction of the mean h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred as a result of h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 3 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ oc@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia is the risk of a dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia in patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral 2 or triple combination therapy with insulin .
after the market launch , treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ one , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported about a occurrence or deterioration of a diab@@ etic mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a with a reduction in visual acuity .
it is uncle@@ ar whether there is a direct link between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a , but con@@ cor@@ dant physicians should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular e@@ dem@@ a when patients report about disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is reduced ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with drugs that are metaboli@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ inhibit@@ ors are not expected .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ pl@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not in@@ valuable from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and the index of the lens , as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic substances .
in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege exceeded the three @-@ fold of the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ y@@ res@@ ide .
in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced macro@@ vascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure in pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ w .
since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ nes@@ is .
a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medications .
over a period of 3.5 years of Pro@@ Active study , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur any symptoms .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated by specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells .
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose analysis in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin had been random@@ ized to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c decreased by 0.@@ 45 % compared to those who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was examined in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diab@@ e@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as minor , but clin@@ ically not significantly elevated L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced overall plas@@ mat@@ ri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d , and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while values decreased under Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the net tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post @-@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which affects the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
in the Pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one are usually achieved within 2 hours of application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV corresponds to the effectiveness in approximately three times the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmaceutical dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
according to the oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the average plasma elimination time of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ite is 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of oral clear@@ ances of the parent substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys occurred after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with h@@ emo@@ di@@ lution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric cardiac hyper@@ tro@@ phy .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ pl@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth is reduced .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) , increased incidence of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( male and female rats ) and tum@@ ours ( male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epithel@@ ium were induced .
in an animal model of the family aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ an resulted in increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparison medication .
in another study of two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in , each with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or g@@ lic@@ la@@ zi@@ d were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in qu@@ oti@@ ents compared to the initial values .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the net tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post @-@ den@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , which has an effect on Tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study lack@@ ed the objective of its primary end@@ point , which presented a combination of total mort@@ ality , non @-@ le@@ thal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , coron@@ ary ar@@ tery syndrome , leg amp@@ utation just above the an@@ kl@@ es , coron@@ ary vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and Rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that no cardiovascular long @-@ time risks are associated with taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .

Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that the blood glucose levels were lowered as much as with another human insulin .
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package template ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks associated with the treatment of diabetes .
in October 2002 the European Commission issued Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day if a quick initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar levels have improved significantly for example by intensified insulin therapy can detect hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia alert symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change in terms of strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or production method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in the dosage .
if a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied and / or taken at other times .
the physician must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines taken by them .
4 As hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which may occur in a not sufficiently controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can lead to loss of consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent disturbances in brain function and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Oc@@ ca@@ sional - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control may be associated with complaints that are referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .

diseases of the skin and the lower skin tissue Un@@ know@@ ingly - Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy At the injection site , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can arise if failed to change the insertion points within the injection area .
general ail@@ ments and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur .
diseases of the immune system Oc@@ ca@@ sional - Ur@@ tic@@ aria , Ex@@ an@@ them Very rare - an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions symptoms of gener@@ alized hyper@@ sensitivity , including gener@@ alized rash , it@@ ching , swe@@ ating , gastro@@ intestinal disorders , angi@@ on@@ euro@@ tic e@@ dem@@ a , breathing difficulties , pal@@ pit@@ ations , low blood pressure and f@@ ain@@ ting / un@@ consciousness .
hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , however , can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods .
diab@@ e@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar@@ s , can@@ dies , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by a proven auxiliary person or by glucose , which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total length of activity is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a series of split ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other ingredients .
in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 the European Commission issued Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S approval for the placing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the quickly acting insulin must first be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is necessary when switching to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied and / or taken at other times .
5 General ail@@ ments and complaints at the site of the administration - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection site Dur@@ ing the insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diab@@ etic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diab@@ etic patients undergoing larger surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id induced normal gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration of activity is about 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diab@@ etic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data is limited but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

this can happen : if you inj@@ ected too much insulin , if you eat too little or leave a meal • if you do more than otherwise physically
always set the cap of your Nov@@ o@@ Home finished p@@ ens when it is not in use to protect it from light .
• Dis@@ inf@@ ect the rubber membrane with a medical t@@ amp@@ on • Use always for each injection a new injection needle to avoid contamination . • Remove the protective cloth from a Nov@@ o@@ Fine injection needle • Scre@@ w the injection needle straight and firmly on Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let ( Figure A ) • Drag the large outer cap of the injection needle and the inner cap of the injection needle .
proceed as follows to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle upwards • tap a few times with your finger easily against the cartridge .
when air bubbles are present , they will accum@@ ulate at the top of the cartridge • Wh@@ ile you continue to hold the injection needle , rotate the cartridge around one click towards the arrow ( Figure B ) • As the injection needle continues to show upwards , press the pus@@ h@@ button in the whole ( Figure C ) • Now you have to remove a drop of insulin from the tip of the injection needle .
• Place the cap back on the finished pen again so that digit 0 is compared to the metering stamp ( Figure D ) • Check if the pus@@ h@@ button is pressed completely .
if the pus@@ h@@ button cannot move freely , insulin is pressed from the injection needle . the scale on the cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units .
the pus@@ h@@ button moves out@@ wards while you turn the cap on • The dial under the push button ( press stud scale ) shows 20 , 40 and 60 units .
107 • Record the highest number you can see on the press stud • add the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have adjusted a wrong dose , turn the cap forward or reverse until you have adjusted the correct number of units .
turn it until the push button is at the bottom and you can feel a resistance , then take the cap off and put it back in such a way that the 0 of the metering stamp is opposite .
make sure to press the pus@@ h@@ button only during the injection • Ke@@ ep the button after the injection , until the injection needle has been pulled out of the skin .
it may be in@@ accurate • You cannot adjust a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual scale to estimate how much insulin is left , but you cannot use it to adjust or select your dose .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of crystal deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or po@@ ison@@ ous notes ( &quot; stones &quot; i.e. larger pri@@ cel@@ ium deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still over 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
during the first treatment months still rheum@@ atic attacks can occur ; therefore , during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic , patients may still take other medicines to prevent g@@ out attacks .
the medicine is not recommended for children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not investigated for these groups .
in the first study involving 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another drug for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia ) .
in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol each year .
in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was used in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels were below 6 mg / dl in the blood during the last three measurements .
in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who once daily took 120 mg of ur@@ ic acid in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common adverse events of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ hea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
especially in patients with heart problems in the pre@@ history there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects affecting the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the reduction of the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there could also be a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ ate deposits ( including one out of medical history known or currently present g@@ out and / or rheum@@ atic arthritis ) .
if the level of serum levels is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x a day .
in patients with severe kidney function restriction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and young people Sin@@ ce there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients .
organ transplan@@ t receiver Sin@@ ce there is no experience in organ transplan@@ t receivers , the application of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular disease In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other res@@ inous drugs , acute g@@ out attacks can occur during the treatment process , because the reduction of the serum har@@ row acid level may initially mobili@@ se ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissues .
B. in mal@@ ignant diseases and their treatment ( Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases is likely to rise so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver disease Dur@@ ing Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ or treatment and in the further course according to clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in was no interaction studies carried out at F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ ing can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ exposition ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical studies the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase of adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without having a dosage adjustment for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient .
in a study with test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed an increase of the AU@@ C from Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , indicating a possible f@@ aint inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ sia containing magnesium hydro@@ x@@ ide and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ ide , delays the intake of fi@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) and a decrease in C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ an@@ cies do not include side effects of fet@@ us ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal experimental studies do not cause direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or when performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ or group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years ) and in long @-@ term extension studies ( 1.4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at could be detected .
the risk factors determined in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ cl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that could be related to the medicine and reported in all bas@@ eb@@ lin@@ t treatment groups more than once , are listed below .
diarr@@ ho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical trials no serious rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed .
7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg .
the case @-@ related events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all cases of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1.@@ 900 patient years ) , according to information occasionally .

clinical study results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

lowering the serum har@@ row acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during a visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x a day ; 10 patients with serum cre@@ atine &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x a day .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum har@@ n@@ acid concentrations in subjects , despite their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum har@@ n@@ acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study ( bas@@ eline ) .
the data gathered in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the reduction of the serum levels of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of poison gas in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need any treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of g@@ out , which resulted in a complete dis@@ appearance of the g@@ out k@@ not up to month 24 in 54 % of patients .
increased TS@@ H@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at increased doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dose .
for doses of 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of serum har@@ dening concentration , provided that this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady @-@ state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma mic@@ rot@@ ein binding of F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ es showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites are predominantly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ ide mainly occurs through U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 .
after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ed F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ altered fi@@ del@@ ux@@ e@@ ate ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ altered fi@@ eb@@ lin@@ t ( 12 % ) , Ac@@ yl@@ glu@@ kur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
specific patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure , the C@@ max from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at did not change compared to subjects with normal kidney function .
the average overall AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ ux@@ e@@ at increased about 1.8 @-@ fold of 7,5 μ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ in@@ metabolism and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
at high doses , which were about 4 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred which accompanied a reduction in the performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats .
ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in the carrying rab@@ bit with ex@@ positions , which approximately the 13 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure were dor@@ man@@ t , showed no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects .

in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly serum levels were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the data gathered in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the reduction of the serum levels of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) showed a decrease in the incidence of poison gas in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need any treatment against rheum@@ atism ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disorder where the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , where there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis in order to prove the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in regards to the increase in vitamin D sp@@ ies .
after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , ul@@ c@@ ers ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , abor@@ ted abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as aci@@ dic u@@ pris@@ ings .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D3 or any other component , AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used .
it may not be used in case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission granted Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following hints are exactly to be followed to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or let the tablet melt in the mouth because there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first food intake of the day , which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B . pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ages or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract except p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y are given only under special caution ( see section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , were reported in patients taking al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and requiring hospit@@ alisation ) .
the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible mal@@ ignant reactions , and the patients should be advised to susp@@ end symptoms of severe irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sph@@ ag@@ ia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ active pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe adverse side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an ab@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
whereas in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cer@@ ations were rare ( after market launch ) , some of which were severe and complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw , usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime contains predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates .
there are no data available that indicate whether the replacement of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients requiring a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets on the same day , but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE before the treatment begins .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients have to wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not performed , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied either during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports are from cancer patients , but oste@@ opor@@ osis was also reported .
nevertheless , the Ser@@ um calcium intake rose to &lt; 8.0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ sequence of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ oph@@ agi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

the effects of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two Phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) as well as in the frac@@ ture intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

compared to the placebo group , in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , a 48 % reduction ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % versus placebo was 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures .
in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the entire body was maintained .
fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily , either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the incidence of at least one new spine by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
res@@ or@@ ption involving an intraven@@ ous dose of reference was the mean oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses between 5 and 70 mg after night fasting and two hours prior to the intake of a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardised breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers , the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically meaningful change in the oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 distribution studies have shown that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate temporarily distri@@ butes intraven@@ ous dosage of 1 mg / kg temporarily into soft tissue , but then rapidly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
ex@@ cre@@ tion After intraven@@ ous dose of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , about 50 % of the radio@@ actively marked substance were eliminated in 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the f@@ ences .
following an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 mg , the ren@@ al clearance of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 71 ml / min and systemic clearance does not exceed 200 ml / min .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is not ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys via the aci@@ dic or alkal@@ ine transport system and therefore it is not assumed that in humans the ex@@ cre@@ tion of other medicines is influenced by these transport systems .

mean maximum concentration in serum ( C@@ max ) of vitamin D3 was 5.@@ 9 n@@ g / ml and medi@@ an time until reaching the maximum serum concentration ( T@@ max ) 12 hours .
in the liver , vitamin D3 is rapidly hydro@@ xy@@ elled to 25 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 in the liver and then metaboli@@ zed to 1.@@ 25 @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ xy@@ vitamin D3 , bi@@ ologically active form .
ex@@ cre@@ tion With the administration of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D3 in healthy volunteers the mean separation of radio@@ activity in the urine was 2.4 % in the urine after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % .
characteristics in patients with prec@@ lin@@ ical studies have shown that the proportion of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not stored in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted via the urine .
although no clinical data is available , it is nonetheless to be expected that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in animal tests will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function .
for patients with reduced kidney function , there is a slightly increased cum@@ ulation of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in the bone ( see section 4.2 ) .

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver in order to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
as Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
in addition , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ t , whereby the application of adv@@ enti@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rejected after a period of one year ( for example , by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a recovery of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , further studies were conducted to 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ t and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and investig@@ ates how adv@@ enti@@ f is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .
tre@@ mor , headache , nausea / vom@@ iting , diarr@@ hea ( diarr@@ ho@@ ea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ) , diabetes , increased potassium content ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) and in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any other component , adv@@ enti@@ f may not be applied .
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken at the same time with adv@@ enti@@ f , as the dosage or dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes to immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or hyper@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
following a change to an alternative formulation , therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
the dosage of adv@@ enti@@ f should primarily be based on clinical assessment of impact and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood level regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels should be checked before the change@@ over and over two weeks after change@@ over .
on Day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as level mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated inspections of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under adv@@ enti@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night transplan@@ t phase .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low @-@ clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the adv@@ enti@@ f can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral receipt of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be administered intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
the duration of the application For the suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection must be maintained by immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of the oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ enti@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
further dose adjustments may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change during the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transplantation .
dosage recommendations - liver transplantation pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ enti@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day than once daily gift in the morning .
dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ant@@ f must be a transplan@@ t recipient of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ ph , so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose .
kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the treatment with the oral initi@@ als recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ t must begin for pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection .
heart transplan@@ t in adult patients who are converted to adv@@ enti@@ ls is to take a oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning .
other transplan@@ t recipients though there is no clinical experience with adv@@ enti@@ f in pul@@ mon@@ ary , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ted patients with an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required .
due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , however , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum levels of serum levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine level and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of gra@@ ft rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .
blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be controlled after change@@ over from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , Dos@@ age adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances which could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ enti@@ f is a medication with a low clearance , adap@@ tations of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered .
indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of the blood does not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
in clinical practice , the levels of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with adren@@ al and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
during the following maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml .
this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects , which may occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close @-@ mes@@ hed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be resistant to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
in order to pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ arded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f .
due to possible interactions which may result in a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies during treatment with adv@@ enti@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diarr@@ ho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood is offered , as the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a beta or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed under Pro@@ gra@@ f , which can therefore occur under an@@ agra@@ f .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ load and e@@ dem@@ a .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ignant skin les@@ ions due to suitable clothing or use of a sun@@ screen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus show symptoms of PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered states of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and blur@@ red vision , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.g. .
since adv@@ enti@@ f contain hard capsules , ret@@ arded , lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption have special caution .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
it is therefore recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while adding substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose accordingly to maintain uniform concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a highly pronounced interaction was associated with anti@@ fung@@ al agents such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , is@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ d antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as is used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore , the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are metaboli@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect metabolism .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus reduce the clearance of ster@@ oid @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , it is especially cau@@ tious when making decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially l@@ essen the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of tests on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in comparison to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ cali@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ si@@ va is often not as@@ cer@@ tained precisely because of the treatment of patients and simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
in the following the side effects are listed in descending order : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not in@@ valuable ) .

infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus which often increase suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ co@@ tic , prot@@ ozo@@ al ) .
cases of N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ k@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ enti@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ignant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in combination with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water solu@@ bility and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins , Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ zed .
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects At the molecular level , the effects of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are expected to be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ oli@@ tic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cell nucle@@ us .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell and thus prevents the tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ kin genes .

175 lung transplan@@ ted patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic transplantation and were used in 6@@ 30 cases after a col@@ on transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant .
overall , the safety profile of oral pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
lung transplantation in an interim analysis of a recent multic@@ entre study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported to over 110 patients who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization .
chronic corneal gra@@ ft rejection , the bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it occurred in 2@@ 1,7 % of cases for the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) as the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which there was no acute transplan@@ t impact occurred after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the lung transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in one study , the frequency of the development of a bron@@ chi@@ oli@@ tis obl@@ iter@@ ans syndrome was significantly lower in patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi @-@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed to 205 patients who were simultaneously subjected to pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation following a random@@ ized tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus procedure ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached by 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
col@@ o transplantation The published clinical results of a mon@@ oc@@ entri@@ c study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ at@@ oc@@ rit value and low protein concentrations , which lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or an ampli@@ fication of the metabolism caused by cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely metaboli@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion mainly occurs across the bile .
the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f in case of stable patients ( once daily ) in a ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by peri@@ odic checks during maintenance therapy .

adv@@ ate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether adv@@ ate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which it em@@ powers the formation of the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union named Recom@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so the medicine does not contain any proteins or animal origin .
in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A , including a study involving 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
the main study evaluated the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels with &quot; excellent &quot; or &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headache , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
adv@@ ate may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission granted Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence for the placing of adv@@ ate in the entire European Union .
dosage The dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depends on the sever@@ ity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , on the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
in the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) .
inj@@ ections every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
repeat every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the treatment course , appropriate determination of factor VI@@ II plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and the frequency of inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VI@@ II in order to achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half @-@ value times .
3 Pro@@ phyla@@ xis for long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibit@@ or .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures need to be studied .
the dosing speed should follow after the patient has been diagnosed with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always immune to the pro@@ ko@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma using modified Be@@ thes@@ da As@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors is related to the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant Factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of ha@@ em@@ op@@ hili@@ a A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
A@@ DR@@ s were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which had previously untreated patients with a higher risk of forming inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not in@@ valuable ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ eg@@ els occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 post@@ oper@@ atively day ) in one patient under continuous a@@ DV@@ ATE in@@ fusion .
the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plasma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day .
in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient after 26 ex@@ positions with A@@ DV@@ ATE showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was established .
previously untreated patients from a ongoing clinical study comprised 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contam@@ in@@ ating proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ter against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the incidence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .
7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ ATE has reported hyper@@ sensitivity reactions from the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ to@@ i@@ der reactions ( frequency not known ) .
the activated Factor VI@@ II acts as a factor for the activated Factor IX and acceler@@ ates the formation of activated Factor X from factor X .
all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE were performed in pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ op@@ hili@@ a A ( basic value of factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

special caution when using A@@ DV@@ ATE is required you should inform your doctor if you have recently been treated with factor VI@@ II products , especially if you have developed inhibit@@ ors .
these symptoms can be early signs of an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic sho@@ cks , which can also include the following symptoms : extreme di@@ zz@@ iness , loss of consciousness and extreme breathing difficulties .
if you are taking other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking other medicines or have taken a short time , even if they are non @-@ prescription drugs .
your doctor will calculate your dose A@@ DV@@ ATE ( in international units or I.@@ E. ) depending on your physical condition and body weight , and whether it is used to prevent or treat bleeding .
patients who develop Factor VI@@ II inhibit@@ ors If the expected Fak@@ tor@@ VI@@ II levels in your plasma cannot be reached with A@@ DV@@ ATE or the bleeding can not be controlled , this could be due to the development of factor VI@@ II -
in combination with surgical cath@@ eter infections , lower number of red blood cells , swelling of limbs and joints , prolonged bleeding after removal of drainage , decreased factor VI@@ II levels and postoperative hem@@ at@@ omas .
rare side effects Sin@@ ce the introduction of the drug on the market has been isolated via severe and potentially life @-@ threatening reactions ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ xis ) and other allergic reactions reported ( see above ) .
inform your doctor if any of the reported side effects may be impaired or if you notice any side effects listed in this package .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP still has rated the benefit risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , on the basis of the safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which necess@@ it@@ ates a submission of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , the CH@@ MP has decided to apply for further extension procedures in 5 years .
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company will withdraw its application for the treatment of adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissues that connect and support other structures in the body ) are affected by this .
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus does not trigger infections in humans .
adv@@ ex@@ in would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein again .
the p@@ 53 protein produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored .
in the case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer in the area of the sub@@ structure , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the answers of the company to the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved .
based on the examination of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore brings benefits to patients .
the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
moreover , the company had not adequately proven that adv@@ ex@@ in can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notice CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients participating in clinical trials or &quot; compas@@ sion@@ ate @-@ use &quot; programs with adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed drug release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al path@@ ways caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous membrane swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ate as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ amped .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be trac@@ ed to the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective measures were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
considering all the hay fever symptoms , apart from con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26@@ ,@@ 7 % in the patients who received the L@@ enses alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity , anor@@ ex@@ ia ( loss of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disturbances and nerv@@ ousness .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c active substances or lau@@ at@@ ins ( another drug for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ tension ) or hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension caused by cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe company to appro@@ ve the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but is swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data , the Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine can decrease over time for long @-@ term use .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory passages , treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine as mon@@ otherapy .
since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy .
this is attributable to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , dam@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tiva , which can be used as phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient &apos;s collective and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients must be informed that the treatment of hyper@@ tension or ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of the headache ) must be removed .
in the treatment of the following patient groups caution is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is required at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in the course of clinical ex@@ ams with L@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed .
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the patients treated with placebo , regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone or with alcohol was taken .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be ruled out .
in @-@ vitro studies did not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
the harm@@ lessness of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used during pregnancy .
however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in an impair@@ ment of traffic ability or the ability to operate machinery .
the symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential Latvian gra@@ dients .
headache , anxiety , complicated mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disturbances , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , pre@@ cor@@ tical pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , pup@@ il rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ a@@ thetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al .
there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect determined by nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin .
in the context of a single dose study of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma .
after the per@@ oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the floating equilibrium of distill@@ ates , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 .
within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four test subjects were poor@@ ly metaboli@@ zed .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio equivalent was exposed to exposure according to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin does not recognize any particular dangers for humans .
the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient P@@ seu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ ad@@ ine / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system has been established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( hay fever ) such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and so@@ othing or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ating the nose .

if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the time indicated .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects may be impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
heart hunting , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , sore throat , loss of appetite , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , sugar in urine , increased blood sugar levels , thirst , fatigue , headache , sleep disturbances , nerv@@ ousness and di@@ zz@@ iness .

after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling at@@ ching , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) or skin ras@@ hes have been reported .
about cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart hunting , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diarr@@ hea , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , drow@@ sin@@ ess , sleep disorders , muscle aches , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver enzymes was also very rare .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate for intake ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 mg melt tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution for intake .
for children aged 1 to 5 years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children aged six to eleven , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies of seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also had asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of squ@@ ads , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on day ) before and after six weeks treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution for insertion and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores ( symptom scores ) by 25 to 32 % compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo .
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % was compared to 40 and 33 % of the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ com@@ ine , or any of the other ingredients .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit for the establishment of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union by SP Europe .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies proving efficacy in the use of distill@@ ates in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be performed according to the disease progression and can be stopped after the symptoms have been removed and res@@ um@@ ed .
in persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) , a continuous treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
however , patients should be informed that it can occur in very rare cases of di@@ zz@@ iness , which may lead to impair@@ ment of traffic jams or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side @-@ effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , oral dry ( 0.8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients aged 12 to 17 was the most common side effect head@@ aches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and at 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) .
this includes the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es and the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin to endo@@ thel@@ ial cells .
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses at which des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in a single dose study with adults , the L@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured variables of the flight performance , including the ampli@@ fication of subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis may alternatively also be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and persist@@ ing allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
as shown on the basis of the overall score of the questionnaire regarding quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ junc@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms , and chronic patients can be easily recru@@ ited in a pro@@ spec@@ tively way .
since hist@@ amine removal is a caus@@ ative factor in all age @-@ related diseases , it is expected that as a result of chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of squ@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the majority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study .
an improvement in it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ine compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ ef@@ ulness , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluation of these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , where patients with the general seasonal allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis population were comparable , 4 % of patients achieved a higher concentration of di@@ lor@@ at@@ as .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the en@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
in vivo studies did not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 drug is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
in a single dose study with di@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine at a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin do not recognize any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be used independently of meals to relieve symptoms in allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available that support a treatment of infectious Rhin@@ i@@ tis using A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age metaboli@@ ze the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and undergo a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up in children aged between 2 and 11 years , fully metaboli@@ zed , is identical to that of children who are normally metaboli@@ zed .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ c@@ tose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered additionally ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 years was similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us were reported to be treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multiple dose study for adults and adolescents who were given up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( nine @-@ time clinical dose ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who were eligible for anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily dose of a rate of 1.@@ 25 mg ( between 1 and 5 years old ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years old ) .
because the course of allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents used in the distill@@ ate in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the distill@@ ate in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval was shown .
in controlled clinical trials , no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents .
in an individual daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not lead to an increase in alcohol @-@ induced loss of performance even to an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chr@@ onic I@@ di@@ opathic Ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving the size and number of squ@@ ads at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this restric@@ tive phen@@ otype was similar to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sia ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic r@@ hin@@ i@@ tis , which are fully metaboli@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ time of approximately 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug @-@ accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days for adults and adolescents .
12 In various dose studies , the AU@@ C and C@@ max values of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were comparable with the recommended doses compared to those of adults who received distill@@ ate sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the en@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be ruled out .

there is limited experience from clinical studies proving efficacy in the use of distill@@ ates in young people aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately prior to the application , the bli@@ ster must be opened carefully and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melt tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven so far .
the overall frequency of the side effects between the lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine si@@ rup and placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile established in adult patients .
at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hili@@ s@@ ate to the decreasing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine .

in June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. also officially approved the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for authorisation for the transport of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent the avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
influ@@ enza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily be spread by humans to humans , because people still have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
after administration of the vaccine , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus as &quot; foreign &quot; in the vaccine and forms antibodies against it .
as a result , the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with an influ@@ enza virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane layer of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognis@@ es as a body @-@ foreign ) , was puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment , please contact your attending doctor .
if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus of type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied .
as@@ he@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral drug the patient has taken before , and the lik@@ el@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the drug .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ag@@ ro@@ ase depends on body weight .
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV amount in the blood when combined with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
not to cure AIDS , however , can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV @-@ related infections and diseases .
A@@ gro@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment .
in the studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , after 48 weeks of as@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the burden of vir@@ us@@ load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were very few on the treatment .
in the study with adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
in patients with HIV , which had been resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , de@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r came to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( diarr@@ hea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( ti@@ redness ) .
2 / 3 A@@ gro@@ ase may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients , the car@@ ob ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines that are degra@@ ded just like as@@ phy@@ ase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take a@@ dep@@ ose are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune re@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tical amplifier k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the use of as@@ he@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is not proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gro@@ ase was originally &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approved &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited , which is approved by the European Commission .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a day @-@ maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of ag@@ ro@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gro@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) .
based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
simultaneous use is to be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present the medi@@ ums of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r while taking Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ er@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ag@@ ro@@ ase , does not hin@@ der the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information about this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic @-@ active hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of ag@@ ro@@ ase and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment predomin@@ ate the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Cus@@ hing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al kidney function ( see section 4.5 ) .
since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of ast@@ er@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who take this medicine at the same time , am@@ ate@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the efficacy of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is simultaneously given with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium retreat symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high prop@@ yl alcohol content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other groups of patients .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exc@@ az@@ er@@ bation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other illnesses related to their therapy medications that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
B. increased age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ at@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis occur .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial a@@ eti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis are reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV @-@ disease and / or long @-@ term anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Sub@@ strate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also present the medi@@ ums of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzyme 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metaboli@@ zed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were frequently observed .
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut , the amber mirrors and , if possible , check the virus load and release the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut .
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50 % increase , for C@@ max it is reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials dos@@ ages of 600 mg amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regim@@ en .
52 % decreases if Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but it is recommended that the revenues of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and am@@ per@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , with the gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dosage adjustment is required .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , be careful because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ divided plasma levels .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in the plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , reduction of the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended even though there are no clinical data available for this .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , but the plasma levels of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol a day led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) on the 2.@@ 69@@ fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions with A@@ gener@@ ase .
the patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with ag@@ ro@@ ase .
based on the data of other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ehem@@ ia it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da may not be taken at the same time as ag@@ ro@@ ase , since it can come to res@@ or@@ ption dysfunction .
the simultaneous use of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , ni@@
simultaneous use of ather@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensi@@ fy the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days in subjects , the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ hab@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) .
H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected to increase plasma levels with simultaneous dosing of A@@ gener@@ ase .
since plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medications is not recommended with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to stabili@@ sation of the mirrors , as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used together with or@@ ally taken mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while using par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am is advisable while using A@@ gro@@ ase .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other protein inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ ium removal , especially if there are also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
because of the very low reliability of historic compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation to be given how the amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose can be adjusted when amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International standard ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional dose of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended while applying an ast@@ er@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of potential use for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tate rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the ne@@ sting in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase of 12 body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most side effects associated with ag@@ ro@@ ase therapy were mild to moderate , rose early and rarely lead to the treatment break .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are associated with drug use or other medicines used simultaneously for treating HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fa@@ al fat tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ t fat accumulation ( pins ) .
among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated persons treated with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed only one case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , patients under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r performed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 patients ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
ras@@ hes usually were mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mac@@ ul@@ lo@@ pap@@ al nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r had to be broken off .
oste@@ o@@ arthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mpt@@ om@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initi@@ ation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
patients who received 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily along with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) were similar to those observed under any a@@ dep@@ ase treatment ; an exception formed the increase in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K values , which were very common in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase together with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in the event of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the connection between the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ ached regim@@ ens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .

a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults .

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors appeared :
prot@@ otyp@@ ical interpretation systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / M , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in combination with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( release points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general .
there are currently data for cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral therapies previously untreated ( one of which showed a resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r at the start of treatment and another against Ti@@ o@@ gl@@ avi@@ r ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 Isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 Isol@@ ates ) .
contr@@ ari@@ wise , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tical @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
the early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the evidence of the efficacy of as@@ he@@ ase in combination with rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI treated adults according to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ o@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly stu@@ ffed with low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the Vir@@ us@@ load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ sub@@ surface threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ brid@@ led ast@@ er@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI .
in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration the medium duration ( T@@ max ) up to the maximum serum concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
50 % increase , by contrast , reduced by 30 % for C@@ max when k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimal concentration in the steady state ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , with the amount of in@@ bound Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , probably remains unchanged .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosage interval depending on the total @-@ drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when they are given at the same time with ag@@ ro@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily .
amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is made from the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis .
also , the ren@@ al clearing of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these regim@@ ens lead to amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily without simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas in dos@@ ages occurred in male animals , which correspond to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
the 21 underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .
however , from the present exposure data to the human being , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings .
in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymph@@ oma test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations at human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
up to now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients was observed in clinical trials , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
with systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed which indicate a delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the rein@@ forcing addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sting ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) need to be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a day @-@ maximum dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use is to be carried out with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increase , for C@@ max it is reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma which were achieved twice daily with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
a dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , a close @-@ mes@@ hed monitoring is recommended , as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would be low .
if these drugs are used together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out as a precise predic@@ tion of the effect of the combination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster Ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , reduction of the dosage of ri@@ f@@ ab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although there are no clinical data available for this .

with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International standard ratio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti @-@ thro@@ mbo@@ tic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
during pregnancy , this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the ne@@ sting in the uter@@ us to the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in the event of over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was investigated both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes .
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ konzentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
contr@@ ari@@ wise , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ tical @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; un@@ born &quot; ag@@ ro@@ ase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI .
while absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosage interval depending on the total @-@ drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that in@@ duce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be given with caution when they are given at the same time with ag@@ ro@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
also , the ren@@ al clearing of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; hence the impact of ren@@ al dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .

studies on toxic@@ ity in juven@@ iles , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that in juven@@ iles the metabolism channels are not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking in is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; b@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking into account was neither used with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution for intake is 14 % less than from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not ex@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are in a position to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ det@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a maximum dose of 28@@ 00 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be given , this combination can be avoided in these groups of patients .
although a dose adaptation is not considered necessary for Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for taking in patients with kidney failure ( see section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ yl alcohol content , A@@ gro@@ ase is contra@@ indicated for the inclusion of small children and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be advised that ag@@ ro@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent risk 47 from transmission of HIV to other through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under the supervision of the International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gro@@ ase should be set for duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in the case of hem@@ at@@ mop@@ hili@@ c patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ ages including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ oma and hem@@ at@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C from amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50 % increase , for C@@ max it is reduced by 30 % if k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase the side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated with hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data to 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected to be significantly higher after the oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for the human being is not known . A@@ gro@@ ase solution for intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to the possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us to the prop@@ yl eng@@ ly@@ col contained ( see section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tate rats , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been proven , but it is not known whether amp@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans .
a reproduction study of pregnant rats , given by the ne@@ sting in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a decreased increase of 55 body weight during lac@@ tation during the lac@@ tation period .
the harm@@ lessness of as@@ gener@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether or not they are associated with drug use or other medicines used simultaneously for treating HIV , or whether they are a consequence of the disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral pre @-@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ble@@ ached regim@@ ens with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
the early departure of a failing 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefits of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ born &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large c@@ ous@@ ine volume as well as an un@@ hin@@ dered penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the gen@@ esis of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is uncle@@ ar .

if you have any further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . − This medicine has been prescribed for you personally .
it may harm other people , even if they have the same complaints as you . − When one of the listed adverse effects you are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect of ag@@ ro@@ ase .
the use of as@@ he@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
inform your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above mentioned disorders or take any of the above drugs .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to strengthen the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure you have read the information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting the treatment .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the application of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to gain effect in children aged 4 to 12 years or generally in patients less than 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control blood tilt . − For patients receiving an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , a re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur .
if you are taking certain medicines that may cause serious side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , li@@ do@@ ca@@ ine , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants , and war@@ far@@ in , at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , your doctor may perform additional blood tests to minimize potential safety problems .
it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not breast@@ feed their children under any circumstances to prevent transmission of HIV .
traffic imper@@ me@@ ability and operation of machines No studies on the influence of ag@@ ro@@ ase on driving ability or the ability to operate machinery were carried out .
please take this medicine only after consultation with your doctor if you are aware that you suffer from an intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
to take di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than one hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of A@@ gener@@ ase can be dimin@@ ished .
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg twice daily along with 100 mg k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
if your doctor decides that taking Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
85 In order to benefit as much as possible , it is very important that you take the entire daily dose prescribed by your doctor .
if you have taken a larger amount of ast@@ er@@ ase than you should have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ gener@@ ase , you should immediately contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if you forgot to take A@@ gener@@ ase if you forgot the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase , take it as soon as you think about it and then continue taking the intake as before .
in the treatment of HIV infection it is not always possible to tell if any occurring side effects are caused by A@@ gener@@ ase , by other medicines that are taken at the same time , or by the HIV infection itself .

the application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • Al@@ dar@@ a is to be applied three times a week for small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the cream is to be applied five times a week during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles .
the cream is th@@ inn@@ y to the affected areas before bed@@ time , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks respectively .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or placebo performed either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses .
in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a full treatment rate of 66 % to 80 % in patients treated with Al@@ dar@@ a compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ vis@@ tic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions limit the efficacy and / or the acceptance of cr@@ yo@@ therapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable .
Monday , Wednesday and Friday ( Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) to apply before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin .
the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has to be continued until all the visible stain@@ s in the genital or per@@ ic@@ um area have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption of the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or if an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if after the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only incomplete , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
when a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan .
add the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in a thin layer and rub in the clean@@ sed skin areas infected with dum@@ pl@@ ings until the cream is completely absorbed .
these patients should be weigh@@ ed between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible wor@@ sen@@ ing of auto@@ immune disease .
these patients should be weigh@@ ed between the benefits of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with circum@@ cision leading to circum@@ cision .
an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation has been observed in rare cases , which necess@@ itated treatment and / or caused temporary physical impair@@ ment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine which necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
for the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after the treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied means for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and per@@ ic@@ um area , there are no clinical experiences yet .
although limited data suggest an increased rate of suscep@@ ti@@ bility reductions in HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the suscep@@ ti@@ bility .
treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , nose , lips , or hair loss was not investigated .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream are returned .
if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break can be made of several days .
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
since there are currently no data on long @-@ term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
there are no clinical experience in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended for pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours .
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip .
there are only very limited data about the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ oses in anatom@@ ical spots outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this purpose , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions often occur , but these reactions usually take place in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after sett@@ ling the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong , treatment may be suspended for a few days .
from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed a lower overall rate of healing than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although there is no quanti@@ fiable level of serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) after one or more topical application , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period .
the most frequently involved and possibly or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the bas@@ ali@@ oma patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below .
in these studies the most common , as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the context @-@ related side effect , were a reaction to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream were listed below .
the clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of three times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently on local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / dra@@ ining / dra@@ ining ( 23 % ) and e@@ dem@@ a ( 14 % ) came ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the study plan , the evaluation of clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine cream very often resulted in severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and serious scar@@ ring and c@@ em@@ ol@@ ation ( 19 % ) .
in clinical studies investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic kerat@@ osis , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area .
the in@@ adver@@ tent oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia , norm@@ alized according to oral or intraven@@ ous fluid .
in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of is@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to complete curing of the hands during an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment is clearly superior for 16 weeks of placebo treatment .
at 60 % of the total of 119 patients who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the remaining war@@ ts were completely absent ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved in 23 % of 157 patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five @-@ time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
the data presented in an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non hyper@@ trop@@ hic acts within a co@@ hes@@ ive 25 c@@ m2 area of treatment on the hair@@ y scal@@ p or face .
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ r@@ ence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) after one or two treatment periods .
the approved indications of external suscep@@ ti@@ bility , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually occur in pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
in these studies the efficacy of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest concentrations of the drug in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated half @-@ life expect@@ ancy was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study ; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin .
the data for systemic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application to MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin was low from 6 to 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis or super@@ ficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study conducted for four months for the der@@ mal application showed no similar effects for the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice in mice on three days a week did not in@@ duce tum@@ ours at the application site .
the mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od only has a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , it is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low because of systemic exposure .
tum@@ ours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active ingredient @-@ free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR .
it can harm other people even though these have the same symptoms as you . − When one of the listed adverse effects you are significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .

tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you do not feel comfortable while using Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a cream , you should not use the cream to wash the affected area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
a reduced number of blood cells may make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause a blue stain in your eyes or cause fatigue .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects you are significantly affected or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of the patients ) , burning ( 26 % of the patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of the patients ) .
usually these are lighter skin reactions which , within approximately 2 weeks after the treatment , finish off again .
occasionally , some patients notice changes in the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , tumour formation , skin irrit@@ ation , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and ti@@ redness .
occasionally some patients suffer from changes in the application location ( bleeding , inflammation , wound secre@@ tion , sensitivity , swelling , small s@@ wollen areas in the skin , ting@@ ling , heat sensation or discomfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , sore throat , diarr@@ hea , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis , redness , facial swelling , ul@@ c@@ ers , limbs , fever , weakness or ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not degra@@ ded and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them .
the following non neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , complic@@ ating movements , decreased lung volume , heart and eye diseases .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with rehabilitation equipment , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent allergic reaction .

the study was focused mainly on the safety of the drug but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by investigating its effect in the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion point .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , ta@@ ch@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be known each year and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit for the issu@@ ance of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union to the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule is recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effect related to in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ charging facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption , due to the theore@@ tically elevated risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be performed cau@@ ti@@ ously .
60 minutes before beginning in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tics ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion reactions .
in the case of a slight or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .

3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular up@@ take of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
un@@ desirable drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their prolon@@ gation with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older , are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing lock and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) .
children Un@@ wanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 , with predominantly severe course of course and a treatment duration up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months of the treatment , with a more severe form of ser@@ oton@@ in at the age of 5 ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature withdrawal from the study ) , 13 / 45 patients had no evidence of radio@@ immun@@ op@@ sy ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients , which had never occurred to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version .
patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , whereas in patients with high antibody filters a variable reduction of G@@ AG was detected in the urine .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on the enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro , which seemed to imp@@ air clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions , even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restore of enzyme activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells in the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ ose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study showing the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me each week for another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and ability to improve lung function in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as seen from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further proportion@@ ately to the height of children growing .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment 22 ( 85 % ) had a normal liver size until the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks a clear drop in the G@@ AG mirror in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease @-@ manifestations between the patients , which were taken into account by using a combined end point , the clin@@ ically significant changes across five effectiveness variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a wor@@ sen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with a severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation and 4 with the mean flow form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in Har@@ n in Week 22 .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) found a normal mental development speed according to the Z @-@ Score for this age group ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with mid @-@ course form had a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe course of course only limited or no progress in cognitive development had been observed .
in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regim@@ ens were performed on the G@@ AG mirror in the urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks may represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in a unique gift , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular dangers for humans .
since no tolerance studies have been carried out , this medicine may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the ones listed under 6 .

this tab will provide long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ c@@ ine ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is missing completely .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the ingredients of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if there has been a severe allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; What side effects are possible &quot; ) .
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines Please inform your doctor if you are taking medicines that contain Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of dimin@@ ished action of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have recently taken drugs , including non @-@ prescription drugs .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( another drug against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ignant &quot; ( mal@@ ignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) , advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells .
A@@ lim@@ ta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should use a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as foli@@ c acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic medication &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and liquids must be given before or after cis@@ pl@@ atin ( to prevent a lack of fluid ) .
in patients whose blood cell changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , lowered or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from spl@@ itting .
the conversion of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of activity in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the mal@@ ignant ple@@ ural pregnancy , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another drug against cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and cis@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months , compared to 9.@@ 3 months with the sole administration of cis@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta was 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ial cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta , showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. .
each pier@@ cing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de @-@ injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for primary epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - k@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for over@@ wie@@ v @-@ epi@@ th@@ eli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of the emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed administration as well as a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid on the day after treatment .
during the seven days prior to the first dose of emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , at least 5 doses of foli@@ c acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose .
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week prior to the first p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , a complete blood sample should be created before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ k@@ oc@@ ytes and thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te counter@@ s .
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose examination must take place under consideration of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood sample or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must continue to be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which apply to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC grade 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before treatment
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if there is an hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in patients after 2 doses .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above , compared to patients aged 65 years of age , there is an increased side effect .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dosage adjustment recommended for all patients .
the data layer in patients with a cre@@ atine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a reduced liver function of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase value of &gt; the 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) was not specifically studied in the studies .
patients must be monitored in terms of bone mar@@ os@@ upp@@ ression and P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al count reg@@ ains a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
a dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in previous courses of treatment ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in degree 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ mat@@ ological toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore all patients treated with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed need to be instructed to use foli@@ c acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure for the reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid con@@ current consumption of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ thal@@ isk ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients eligible for therapy with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes .
therefore , a drainage of the eff@@ usion in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space is to be weigh@@ ed before the emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment .
5 primary cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , were occasionally reported in clinical trials with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive ability is made by emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised in front of the treatment course to obtain advice regarding sperm preservation .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oidal anti @-@ ph@@ thal@@ is@@ tics ( N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) lead to a reduced p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the consequence of increased incidence of side effects .
it is therefore advisable to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ( see section 4.4 ) .
since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ I@@ Ds with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Norm@@ alised ratio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ timet@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy .
emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed must not be used during pregnancy , except when necessarily - demanding and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability is made by emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm .
it is not known whether p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma and the random@@ ized cis@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , and 163 patients with mes@@ oth@@ eli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

for this table , a threshold of 5 % was specified in relation to the recording of all events in which the doctor reported a connection to P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed .
clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed included sup@@ ra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar to Phase 2 of the combined results of three single p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mono@@ therap@@ i@@ est@@ u@@ des , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared with 5.3 % ) and an increase in the Alan@@ in@@ tran@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to lead to differences in the patient population as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and well @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver functional tests are included .

severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and tran@@ sit@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were occasionally reported in clinical studies with p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic agent .
clinical studies occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ li@@ tis ) .
in clinical trials , patients with emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed treatment have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial Pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were be@@ amed before , during or after their emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
in vitro studies showed that P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed acts as an anti@@ fol@@ ate with multiple targets by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ e syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of Thy@@ mid@@ ine and Pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des .
E@@ MP@@ HAC@@ IS , a multic@@ entre , random@@ ized , easy @-@ blind phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus cis@@ pl@@ atin against cis@@ pl@@ atin in chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with mal@@ ignant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma showed that with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin treated patients had a clin@@ ically important advantage of a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) related to the mal@@ ignant ple@@ ural oth@@ eli@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) compared with the sole Cis@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / cis@@ pl@@ atin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multic@@ entre , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC achieved medi@@ an survival time of 8.3 months with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA treated patients ( intent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favor of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epithel@@ ial hist@@ ological type ( n = 0.@@ 78 ; 95 % CI = 0.@@ 61 @-@ 1.@@ 00 , p = 0.0@@ 47 ) , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment are similar to doc@@ et@@ axel .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with IT@@ T population analyses and support the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin combination .
medium PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for combining A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3,@@ 9 ) for the combination of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA Cis@@ pl@@ atin versus 28.@@ 2 % ( 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine Cis@@ pl@@ atin .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = focus @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the overall population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) clearly below the non @-@ sub@@ ordination rate of 1.@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and cis@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
furthermore , patients required the administration of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etin / Dar@@ b@@ op@@ o@@ etin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron supplements ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed as mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tum@@ ours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours after the application .
P@@ emet@@ re@@ x@@ ed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
in a study involving Be@@ ag@@ le dogs who had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection for 9 months , Tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( de@@ gene@@ - ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ ate epithel@@ ial tissue ) .

the resulting solution is clear and the coloring ranges from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish without compromising the quality of the products .
it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they cannot break down some fats in the food , thereby preventing a quarter of the fats led with the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines .
in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 over@@ weight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at the anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ pe@@ work , stu@@ c@@ ld@@ iness , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , finish o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it may also not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term absorption syndrome ( where insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or from chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) and pregnant or breast@@ feeding mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Limited company to appro@@ ve the placing of or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with over@@ weight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety .
since Or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally res@@ or@@ bed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Chr@@ onic treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tions 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or a fat @-@ rich diet .
since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dosage of anti@@ diab@@ etic needs to be adjusted if necessary .
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage of these drugs must be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures to prevent the oral contrac@@ eption possible in case of severe diarr@@ ho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
a reduction of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma is observed in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally standardized ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be recommended to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vit@@ amine intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
after the administration of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time .
animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented .
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
frequencies are defined as follows : very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not in@@ valuable ) .
the frequency of known side effects found after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known since these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude .
it is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered in normal and over@@ weight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
the majority of cases reported after the release of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose were either reported to have no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the floating properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect begins in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine by co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ en .
clinical studies suggest that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fet@@ us .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cal@@ oric , low @-@ fat diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) .
although the weight reduction was observed in both studies for 12 months , the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the average change in the Gesamt@@ cholest@@ erin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.8 % ( initial value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the waist circum@@ ference was 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3,@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ metaboli@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in the plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation .
in a study involving obes@@ e patients with minimal systemic res@@ or@@ b@@ ated dose , two main met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed Lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ form leu@@ c@@ ine group ) could be identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , can@@ did@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not recognize any particular danger to humans .

for more information on the blue pages in section 6 , you can learn how to define your cal@@ ori@@ ces and fet@@ to@@ ber@@ boar@@ ders .
if you leave a meal or a meal has no fat , don &apos;t take a capsule . all@@ i can only work if the food contains fat .
if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal containing too much fat , you risk nutritional accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) .
in order to get used to the new eating habits , start the first capsule taking with a cal@@ orie and fat reduction diet .
nutritional supplements are effective , as you can understand at any time what you eat , how much you eat and it will probably be easier to change your eating habits .
to safely reach your target weight , two daily goals should be set in advance : one for the calories and one for fat .
• Nutri@@ ent fatty foods to reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional accompanying symptoms ( see section 4 ) . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking the capsules .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects may be impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information .
the most common side effects are associated with the action of the capsules and resulting in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment begins , since at this time you may not have reduced the fat content in your diet .
with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize nutritional accompanying symptoms : • Beg@@ in already a few days , or better a week before taking the capsules with a low @-@ fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take to yourself .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Distri@@ bute your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you may take for each meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main dish or a substantial neighbor , as you may have done with other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these accompanying symptoms occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Do not store the medicine for children . • Do not store any unused medicine after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the cart@@ on . • Do not store the container tightly to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry .
do not swal@@ low them in any case . • You can carry out your daily dose of all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is included in this package .

over@@ weight has an effect on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • High blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart Disease • Stro@@ kes • Oste@@ o@@ arthritis Do you talk to your doctor about your risk of these diseases .
a permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive impact on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day .
note the further tables below in this section . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat you should take with each meal .
please refer to the information below which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the mode of action of the capsule , compliance with the recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat .
by resp@@ ecting the recommended fat intake , you can maxim@@ ize weight loss while reducing the lik@@ el@@ ihood of nutritional accompanying symptoms . • You should try to remove step by step and continuously .
34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to gradually and continuously lose about 0.5 kg per week in weight without developing fru@@ stration and dis@@ appointments .
the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; Low physical activity &quot; means that you do not walk daily , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , i.e. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes .
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set up realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to adhere to it . • Sen@@ su@@ ous is a nutritional journal with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fat @-@ fat and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in combination with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a heal@@ thier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
Alo@@ x@@ i is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ x@@ i can be increased by adding an additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic medicine ) .
the application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group .
this means that the active ingredient prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the gut .
Alo@@ x@@ i was studied in three main studies of 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ x@@ i showed no vom@@ iting ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) in 24 hours after chemotherapy , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ x@@ i showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) in 24 hours after chemotherapy , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ x@@ i ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Alo@@ x@@ i in the entire European Union to the company of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd .
Alo@@ x@@ i is indicated : for the prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to a cancer illness and for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in case of chemotherapy , due to a cancer .
the efficacy of Alo@@ x@@ i for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy .
since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on sage , patients with an@@ am@@ ne@@ sty ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection .
however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to a further chemotherapy dose , Alo@@ x@@ i is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not block the activity of the five studied chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( cis@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interactions between a single intraven@@ ous dose of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ser@@ tral@@ ine and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the cle@@ av@@ age of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
experience for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies is not present , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician .
clinical trials were the most common side effects observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly associated with Alo@@ x@@ i , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the location ( burning , curing , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing reports .
in the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ effective relationships observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy in an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients receiving moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 D@@ ox@@ or@@ u@@ bic@@ in and 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time 7.@@ 3 hours ) were given , which was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2@@ Cis@@ pl@@ atin , &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of the studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
in clinical trials for indication chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion@@ ic channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study conducted at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption after IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half @-@ time of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ propor@@ tionally in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients .
following intraven@@ ous dosage of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the average ( ± SD ) increase in pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % was measured between day 1 and day 5 .
out of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations , the overall composition ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) of 0.@@ 25 mg pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , measured at once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 75 mg , was comparable ; however , the C@@ max was 0.@@ 75 mg higher after one @-@ time injection of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites , which in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
in vitro studies for metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser degree , are involved in the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the metabolism of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
after an intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ altered substance made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection in healthy patients , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified by this .
in pre @-@ clinical studies effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion@@ ic channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and can pro@@ long the term of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tum@@ ours , en@@ doc@@ rine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ours in rats , but not in mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ x@@ i is determined in humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is very small .
the holder of this approval for the placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for the placing of the drug approved as part of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the approval for the transport of the medicine designated for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug which has already been approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reference medicinal products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
in the case of a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue detects damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ in Amin@@ o s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are hei@@ gh@@ tened in the blood .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) is introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the Al@@ ph@@ eon manufacturer presented data demonstrating the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped ( i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ em@@ e@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non @-@ commercial purposes only provided the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient .
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after setting the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease fl@@ ared up in more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
apart from that , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , is not sufficiently vali@@ dated .
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ la@@ er@@ ations ( tears or cuts ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ con may not work against this type of infection .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be used in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was s@@ cl@@ ed at the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients suffering from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin dogs , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : if the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs , about 90 % of both groups spoke to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ei@@ ter@@ med cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or of infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most frequent side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the placing of the order .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go prevail in short @-@ term treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ aries , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and consider alternative therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the event of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by applying retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment is abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection has begun .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections where MR@@ SA is known or suspected as a patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials of secondary un@@ infected open wounds the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ o@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2 to 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of simultaneous use of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ine and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application of skin or infected super@@ ficial wounds ( see section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral dosage of 2 times a day 200 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , the mean re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on weakened skin of healthy adult men increased by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required when topical retin@@ ap@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the application of systemic antibiotics .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / termin@@ ated or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / termin@@ ated , the benefit of breast@@ feeding is to be weigh@@ ed for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections that have applied Al@@ tar@@ go was the most commonly reported side effect irrit@@ ation at the location , which was about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us Pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective inhibit@@ ing of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a specific binding site of the 50s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome , which differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the binding site of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer centre .
by binding on this binding site , p@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhi@@ bits pep@@ tide transfer , blocking parts of P @-@ binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50 @-@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units .
if due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms seem question@@ able , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin versus S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the Isol@@ ate were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in case of non @-@ responding to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tr@@ unks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the treatment and in children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , the maximum individual systemic up@@ take of people after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 sh@@ red@@ ded skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies on oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid gland changes .
in @-@ vitro review of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vivo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there was neither male nor female rats showing signs of restricted fertility for oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , which has achieved an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 )
in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats , for oral dos@@ ages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development toxic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity were detected .

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can end .
if a refres@@ her dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given .
vacc@@ ines work by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) as it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ rix includes the same components as the vacc@@ ines approved since 1996 and the vacc@@ ination of Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same illnesses , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data supporting the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two inj@@ ections .
at between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month distance between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection site , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
August 2002 the European Commission issued a permit to Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
the standardi@@ zation plan for prim@@ ers with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose ranges from six to twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B , the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine may be vacc@@ inated .
the anti @-@ hepatitis C surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and Anti @-@ Hepatitis A Virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ V ) antibodies observed after a basic dimm@@ ing with the combination vaccine are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons who have addressed a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination need a booster as protection , since they may also be protected with immun@@ ological memory even in cases of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the application of the vaccine .
if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in the case of h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis patients and people with dis@@ rup@@ tions of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value can be reached after bas@@ al dimm@@ ing , so that in these cases the application of additional vacc@@ ines can be required .
since an in@@ tra @-@ male injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to a sub@@ optimal imp@@ unity in the glut@@ eal muscles , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
however , in the case of thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
when Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ea , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ tin , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in previous thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ - and preserv@@ atives @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 V@@ acc@@ ine Ambi@@ rix vaccine was administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years , Ambi@@ rix toler@@ ability was compared to that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per vacc@@ ination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed after the dose of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.1 % in the test persons after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
according to the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the volunteers who received Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % in the test subjects , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the frequency of matches , however , was comparable high ( i.e. over the total vacc@@ ination cycle of 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the volunteers who received Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of severe pain and sensitivity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vaccine .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vacc@@ ines , the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to the hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen with 360 ELISA units .
in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a more frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection site ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported .
the proportion of vacc@@ inations that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vaccine with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis C virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was statisti@@ cally not different .
in clinical trials conducted for vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9,@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
the ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 were awarded the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 people whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher versus hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of 3 @-@ dose vaccine higher than with Ambi@@ rix .
the immune responses , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table .
in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme for persons who were between 12 and 15 years of age .
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to the hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen @-@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study of 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be compared 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ ination scheme is compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was given simultaneously with the booster shot of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ ea , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ yel@@ i@@ tis@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient for all anti@@ gens .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the present formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conversion rates for the present formulation as for the earlier formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing on any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state batch release shall be carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorised for this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by virus @-@ containing foods and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other means , such as bathing in the waters of contaminated waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a steady treatment necessary .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not completely protect from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B viruses , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses .
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B viruses before administration of both vacc@@ ines ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ well or ill at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that cause damage to the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any ingredient of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express itself through it@@ chy skin ras@@ hes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has occurred to you / your child for an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a severe infection with fever .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usual administration of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
at a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vacc@@ ination dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ active hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface treatment ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vacc@@ ination protection before termination of the vacc@@ ination series .
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected by people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child is weakened because of a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s own defense , or if you / your child undergo a h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis .
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination can not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take other medications ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you have received / your child recently vacc@@ inated / has been given / has been given / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibody ) given / has or this is planned in the near future .
it may however be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine must be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as many extre@@ mes as possible .
if Ambi@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; usually , Ambi@@ rix pregnant or breast@@ feeding women will not be given unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B . &quot; &quot; &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ ching • irrit@@ ability • head@@ aches • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection site • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • Ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal disorders
further side effects reported in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 fall per 10,000 recycled cans ) are :
these include loc@@ alized or extended ras@@ hes which can be it@@ chy or spher@@ ical , swelling of the eye and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 Find your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed adverse effects you / your child will be significantly impaired or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data , which have become known since the first approval for the placing of the market , the CH@@ MP believes that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive .
since Ambi@@ rix was only transported in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine was limited due to the low patient exposure .
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ia @-@ mic en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
ammon@@ ites - split into several individual doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under food or administered via a Gast@@ ro@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study , as ammon@@ ites could not be compared with a different treatment or placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active agents ) .
ammon@@ ites may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , fla@@ vor@@ ing , abdominal pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disturbances in the ure@@ a cycle could effectively prevent high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ammon@@ ites was approved under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; since only limited information on this medicine was available due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) , an indication for use occurs when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ nes@@ is .
for babies , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form .
the daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily intake of the patient &apos;s daily protein intake .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ gh@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ city .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ atal deficiency must receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15,@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders as there is a risk for the gen@@ esis of es@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach .
each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium retention and o@@ dem@@ formation .
since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; therefore , the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
at sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down in neur@@ onal prolifer@@ ation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted by humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during lac@@ tation is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , at 56 % of patients had at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very frequently ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ too , severe hypo@@ thal@@ mia , bul@@ let top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an in@@ adver@@ tent single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms start with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous dose of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the survival chances and the clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infected , and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
by h@@ emo@@ di@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nitrogen removal ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first month of life ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late @-@ manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ go@@ tic form of the Or@@ ni@@ eth@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were treated by a hyper@@ dom@@ es@@ ian en@@ cephal@@ opathy and then treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a prot@@ ein@@ ated diet , the survival rate was 98 % .
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is known to ox@@ idi@@ se phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate into phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidneys , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
the concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in an empty healthy adult and in patients suffering from disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis after single assignment as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( un@@ controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found 15 minutes after the intake .
in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary disorders or h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) could not be detected in plasma the next morning after fasting .
in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma cruci@@ ble were five times higher than after the first gifts .
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
according to the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses had no clear effects ( examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken or@@ ally ( inf@@ ants and children who are not able to swal@@ low any tablets or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ om@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ auch or a nas@@ al probe .
according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , inf@@ ants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ gh@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ city .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g. of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
when rats were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabolism of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , les@@ ions occurred in the pyrami@@ ds of the brain cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in combination with lac@@ tat@@ too , severe hypo@@ thal@@ mia , bul@@ let top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ ric atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram of bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ supply can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ular form , plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found 15 minutes after the ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the duration of the shelf life , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon contains 0.@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the solu@@ bility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accum@@ ulate in the body after the consumption of proteins .
if laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may influence the results of certain laboratory tests .
when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you are taking other medicines or have taken a short time , even if it is not prescription drugs .
during breast@@ feeding , you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , om@@ is@@ sion of the ear , dis@@ ori@@ ti@@ ousness , memory disturbances and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you encounter any of these symptoms with you , immediately contact your doctor or with the emergency reception of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating a suitable treatment .

you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to the same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Cut a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the upper edge of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • Take the recommended number of measuring sco@@ op gran@@ ulate from the container .
angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example with inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the thor@@ ax with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; lifting &quot; ( abnormal measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent a closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots like Ab@@ ci@@ x@@ ima@@ b and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS was an@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in the prevention of new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment .
in patients who underwent one PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than He@@ par@@ in .
angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ valent studies , other mil@@ let or any other component .
it may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve the transport of an@@ gi@@ ox@@ es across the European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if one PCI is performed in a further episode , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to clinical requirements , the reduced in@@ fusion dosage of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours .
immediately prior to the procedure , an injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be given , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure .
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial I.@@ V. injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and efficacy of a single Bol@@ us gift from An@@ gi@@ ox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medication should be carefully mixed before use and the injection dose should be quickly administered intraven@@ ously .
as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dosage is given correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ valent studies against ACS or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT @-@ value is less than 225 seconds , it is possible to admini@@ ster a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg and to re@@ consider the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the use of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with an@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous dose of non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against deer . • severe un@@ controlled hyper@@ tension and / or ir@@ reversible cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ based patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially when bi@@ valent studies are administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even though most ble@@ edings on arter@@ ial points occur in the case of PCI @-@ patients under bi@@ valent studies , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur throughout the treatment in principle .
in patients who take War@@ far@@ in and be treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ alised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with bi@@ valent studies is again achieved prior to the treatment .
based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes ) , it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding .
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n with thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological h@@ emo@@ st@@ ase@@ parameters are to be checked regularly in any case .
the experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n alone , 46@@ 04 were random@@ ised to bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 46@@ 03 were random@@ ised to either un@@ question@@ able he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ valent studies group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , patients and patients over 65 were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding was defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding , as in Table 2 foot@@ notes .
both mild and severe ble@@ edings were significantly less frequent than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events : in@@ trac@@ ran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intraocular bleeding or hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge in the point of punc@@ ture , dimin@@ ution of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with well @-@ known bleeding point , Re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
further , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ aliz@@ ations , which occurred at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; punc@@ tu@@ ation points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck .
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bi@@ valent studies of 6@@ ,000 patients who underwent one PCI .
both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , patients and patients over 65 were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both mild and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent than in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects which are not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organ classes .
in the event of over@@ dosing , the treatment with bi@@ valent studies must be stopped immediately and the patient can monitor closely mes@@ hed with regard to the signs of bleeding .
angi@@ ox contains bi@@ valent studies , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds to the cataly@@ tic center as well as in the ion @-@ binding region of thro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or cl@@ ots .
binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n to thro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in slowly spl@@ its the bond of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n with serum from patients with serum induced thro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) could not in@@ duce plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation reactions .
in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is proven by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if one PCI was performed in the following patients , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ valent studies should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coron@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST up@@ lift inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before starting angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ ization ) or in the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high risk patients who required angi@@ ography within 72 hours were equally distributed over the 3 treatment arms .
approximately 77 % of patients had recur@@ ring isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent an angi@@ ography within 72 hours .

clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ udi@@ n were evaluated in patients undergoing a perc@@ ut@@ aneous coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with ACS .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is administered sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ ig@@ h or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to control glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin differs very slightly from human insulin , and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration of activity than a short @-@ term human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
in the case of type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot effectively work insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin le@@ aps .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin lu@@ li@@ sin or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH .
as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , th@@ ig@@ h or delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ en .
due to reduced glu@@ con@@ ogen@@ esis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function .
any change of active force , brand ( producer ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ delayed etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement .
3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diab@@ etic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions potentially life threatening .
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the activity profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is converted .
substances which increase blood sugar @-@ lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia include oral anti@@ diab@@ e@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , disc@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , fibr@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , pent@@ oxi@@ f@@ y@@ ll@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ am@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics .
in addition , under the effect of symp@@ a@@ thetic agents such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter@@ regulation can be weakened or absent .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ lu@@ li@@ sin and human insulin regarding pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin lu@@ li@@ sin occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin does not enter breast milk , nor is it res@@ or@@ bed after oral use .
the following are the clinical trials known from clinical studies , group@@ ed according to system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very often : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10.000 ; not known ( frequency on the basis of available data is not in@@ valuable ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , as a result of a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a suit@@ ably trained person , or intraven@@ ous dose of glucose by a physician .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption ( especially skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin the effect occurs faster and the duration of operation is shorter than in case of hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
in a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin lu@@ c@@ sin in the therapeutic @-@ relevant dosing range from 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glucose @-@ giving effect , just like human insulin .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect around 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that at an application of insulin lu@@ li@@ sin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ den@@ o@@ e@@ al gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved such as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin was de@@ pl@@ eted 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ o@@ den@@ al control was achieved than with a human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin lu@@ li@@ sin is applied 15 minutes after the meal begins , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , such as in human normal insulin , which is given 2 months before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin given 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min . ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin @-@ lu@@ li@@ sin by offering 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
