<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Research Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you need more information about your illness or treatment, please read the package template (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id="3">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="4">It is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirelessly thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar-I disturbance, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternately with periods of normal mood.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat mild to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for rapid control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders if oral consumption of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for inserting or treatment tablets in patients with difficulty swallowing pills.</seg>
<seg id="9">For patients who are taking other medicines at the same time as Abilify, the dose should be adjusted by Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="10">This impairs signal transmission between brain cells by "neurotransmitters," i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells among themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is probably mainly known as "partial Agonist" for receptors for neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that Aripiprazole works like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but to a lesser extent as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">As dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize brain activity, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their reoccurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies of 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, compared to 160 patients with which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered from increased unrest, compared with Lorazepam (another antipsychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies, the change in the symptoms of the patients was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to take away (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg showed a significantly greater reduction in the symptoms of increased anxiety than those receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">When applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-time studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo.</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented for up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo to replay manic episodes in previously treated patients and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10 or 15 mg doses also decreased more effectively than placebo the symptoms of increased unrest and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of Abilify for intake (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (drowsiness), headache, blurred vision, dyspepsia (nausea), nausea, fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disturbances) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and where the manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazl prevail over the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">Furthermore, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased unrest and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with chronic episodes of bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweigh the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission granted the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the placing of Abilify in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of severe to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on treatment with Aripiprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased efficacy in dosages of 15 mg over a daily dose was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">Considering the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be taken into account if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behaviour is part of psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after the onset or after a replacement of antipsychotic therapy, even in cases of treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accumulating and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="39">If an Abilify treated patient signs signs and symptoms of a late dyskinesia should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a MNS or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be deposited.</seg>
<seg id="41">Therefore Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states related to seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease, had an increased risk of dying compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">There was, however, in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response for undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no exact risk estimates for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs that permit direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polymeritis, polyuric, polyphagic and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazl by 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">It is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl as compared to CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the joint administration of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as istraconazole and HIV proteinase inhibitors are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be administered with a moderate increase in aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazl per day showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextrometorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C9 (warfarin), 2C19 (Omeprazl) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphic).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">Due to the insufficient data situation for the safety of the human being and the concerns raised in the reproductive studies of the animal, this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk of the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole showed a overall lower incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and Dyskinesia compared to patients treated with Haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of over 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole was 15.1% in patients with Olanzapin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar I disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23.5% in patients with aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study for 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% was for those of lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy and their incidence of treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate acute overdosing with aripiprazole alone was observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death.</seg>
<seg id="73">There is no information about the efficacy of a hematalysis in the treatment of an overdose with aripiprazole; however, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, as Aripiprazl has a high plasma microtein binding.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonistic effect on dopamine 2 and serotonin 5HTA receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity for dopamine D2 and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HTA and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity for dopamine D4-, for serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7-, for alpha-1 adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In dosage of Aripiprazole in doses from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks in healthy volunteers, positron-emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and the putty.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term trials (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazl 77% and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current measured values defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery Assign- DepressionsRate Scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher decline in the decline rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapia trials with flexible dosage for 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose involving patients with a manic or mixed episode of the bipolar I error, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic traits, Aripiprazl showed a effectiveness against placebo in week 3 and a conservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In Week 12, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which sometimes did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase of 74 weeks for manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomisation, Aripiprazl was superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a back into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyation of Aripiprazl, the N-Dealkyylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl in extensive metabolism via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= "poor") metabolism via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazl there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients showed no gender-related effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A pop-up-specific analysis of pharmacokinetics resulted in no indication of clinically significant differences in the ethnicity or the effect of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different cirrhosis (Child-Pugh Class A, B and C) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of the liver function to the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazl and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with cirrhosis of the class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and candidogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no importance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 10times the middle Steady State exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose of humans.</seg>
<seg id="97">A cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugatives of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazl in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the average dose of the recommended dose for humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate of hydroxy- Aripiprazole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the Galle of monkeys, and are far below the limit values (6%) of in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, which led to expositions of 3 and 11 times the mean steady state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="145">In order to increase the absorption and to minimize the variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the gluteus maximus muscle is recommended in the bypass of obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) may be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acut therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If any further oral treatment is indexed with Aripiprazole, see the summary of the features of the medicine to Abilify tablets, Abilify Melting tablets or Abilify solution for taking.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no investigations on the efficacy of Aripiprazl injections in patients with aggibility and behavioural disorders, which have been differently caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aripiprazl injection solution, patients should be observed in extreme sedation or blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Investigations on the safety and efficacy of Aripiprazole injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accumulating and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during treatment with Aripiprazol.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing planes of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and cardiac arrhythmias).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polymeritis, polyuric, polyphagic and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored in terms of worsening glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar disorder due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect or an unhealthy lifestyles and could lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of the sedation was greater compared to that of Aripiprazl, in a study in which healthy volunteers Aripiprazol (15 mg dose) were applied as one-time intramuscularly and the simultaneously Lorazepam (2 mg dose) were intra-muscular.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazl in comparison with CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as istraconazole and HIV- proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar can reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose height before starting the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dose) intramuscular were the intensity of sedation larger compared with the following allusion of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were reported more frequently in clinical trials with Aripiprazol injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more common (≥ 1 / 100) compared to placebo or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS 19% in patients under Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients under placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS 26.6% in patients with Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% was for those of lithium treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS 18.2% for patients under Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups under Aripiprazl and placebo, where potentially clinically significant changes in routine controlled laboratory parameters occurred, showed no medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases of CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole, compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Adverse events related to antipsychotic therapy and their incidence of treatment with Aripiprazole include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disorders was the Aripiprazol injection solution associated with statistically significantly greater improvements of aggibility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-time study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as aggibility and behavioural disorders, the Aripiprazl injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of detachment and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lorazepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The mean improvement from initial value on the PANSS Excitement component score at the primary 2-hour end point was 5,8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8,7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe detachment, a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population, but a statistical significance could be detected because of a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term trials (4 to 6 weeks) on 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed a statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, 52% of responder patients receiving a response to the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazol 77% (oral) and Haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current measured values defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg-Depressionsroasted scale showed a significantly stronger improvement than at Haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl (oral) showed a significantly higher decrease in the return rate of 34% in the Aripiprazol- (oral) group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Olanzapin-controlled, multinational double blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks involving 314 patients and in which the primary study goal was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients showed a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) with an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, which partly did not respond to lithium or valproate monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension for manic patients who had achieved a remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase prior to randomisation, Aripiprazl was superior to the prevention of a bipolar decline, mainly in the prevention of a regression into mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">The Aripiprazol AUC is 90% larger in the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, after administration of the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers, the mean time was up to 1 to 3 hours after reaching the maximum plasma cone.</seg>
<seg id="184">The application of Aripiprazole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application for systemic exposure (AUC), which were 15- or 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity following IV application no safety-relevant concerns were found after maternal exposure, the 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) over the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on the conventional studies with Aripiprazol (oral) for safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and for candidogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions that significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so that they have only limited or no importance for clinical application.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent side-kidney toxicity (Lipofuscin accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equal to 10 times the mean steady state-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">A cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of sulfate conjugatives of Aripiprazole in the gall of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16- to 81 times the recommended maximum dose in humans based on mg / m2).</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, about three quarters of which had previously received an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in the sole dose or as monotherapy) was compared with the conventional paclitaxel containing drug (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, 72 (31%) of 229 patients treated with Abraxane spoke to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of 225 patients who received conventional paclitaxel chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="270">If one considers only the patients treated for the first time for metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between drugs in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to worsening disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">In contrast to these indicators, patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel containing medicines.</seg>
<seg id="272">It may not be used in patients who breastfeed or have low neutrophils in the blood before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) stated that Abraxane was more effective in patients where the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional paclitaxel containing medicines and that in contrast to other paclitaxel contained medicines it does not have to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted the company Abraxis BioScience Limited a permit for the transport of Abraxanes throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-Monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients whose first-line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anthracycline-containing treatment is not shown (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutropathy &lt; 0,50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory Neuropathy Grade 3, treatment can be interrupted until a recovery is reached on degrees 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>

<seg id="279">There were no studies with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no sufficient data on the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is an albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of paclitaxel, which may have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptomatic treatment should be initiated, and the patient may not be treated with paclitaxel again.</seg>
<seg id="283">In patients no further abrasion cycles should be initiated until the neutrophal number is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocytes again increased to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a clearly associated cardiotoxicity is not proven with Abraxane, cardiac occurrences in the indicated patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with earlier anthracycline treatment or underlying heart or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there is nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients following the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetics and constiptive means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant or women in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is inevitable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraction method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients who are treated with Abraxane are advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of sparing prior to treatment, because the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as tiredness (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the traffic ability and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">Listed below are the most common and major incidents of adverse events that occurred in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in the pivotal Phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most conspicuous important hematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (b &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed at 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects associated with the application of Abraxane as monotherapy at each dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000); very rare (&lt; 1 / 10.000).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: elevated blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactic hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorus in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, bloating, tongue burning, dry mouth, toothache, loose stools, esophagitis, pain in the abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest pain, weakness of the musculature, abdominal pain, groin pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal musculature, flank pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness Very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in relation to a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">Since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual incidence were possible and there was no causal connection with these events.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an antimicrotubules active ingredient that promotes the incorporation of the microtubules from the tube indigenes and stabilizes microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization results in an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into the endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel by endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelials transport is mediated by the gp-60's albuminous receptor and occurs due to the albuminous protein acidic rich in cysteine) a paclitaxel-accumulation in the area of the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single-armed investigational studies and 454 patients treated in a randomised Phase III trial study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an infusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicentre study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of solvent-containing paclitaxel 175 mg / m2 as a 3-hour infusion with premediation to prevent an allergic reaction (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without premeditation (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a distressing general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had only adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastatic disease and 19% due to metastatic disease and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression free survival and survival for patients receiving first-line therapy are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity versus paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced a peripheral neuropathy Grade 3 at a time during therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy at baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetics of the total paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusions of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">Active ingredient exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml in analogous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After IV administration of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume amounted to 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume points to a far-reaching extravascular distribution and / or soft distribution of paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane according to a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent-containing paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The clearance of paclitaxel was higher (43%) after the Abraxane dosage (43%) compared to a solvent-containing paclitaxel injection, and the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In the published literature on in-vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is mainly metabolized to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the average total dose for cumulative uric excretion was 4% of the total dose with less than 1% of the Metabolites 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p-hydroxypaclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data are available to patients aged over 75 years, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">Chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anti-carcinogenic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be cautious when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, a 10 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is slowly injected over a period of at least 1 minute (0.9%).</seg>
<seg id="327">After full encore of the solution, the water bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the water bottle should be swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until a complete resusbed of the powder is done.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitations or sinking substances are visible, the piercing bottle has to be gently inverted to achieve a complete resuspension before applying.</seg>
<seg id="330">The exact dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension required for the patient is calculated and the corresponding amount of the reconstituent Abraxane is injected into an empty, sterile PVC- or non-PVC infusion bag.</seg>

<seg id="357">Member states must ensure that the holder of approval for placing on the market before the market launch provides medical personnel in dialysis centers and retail stores with the following information and materials:</seg>
<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (specialist information), labelling and packing supplement. • With unique imaging of the correct application of the product, refrigerated boxes for transport through the patient.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that Abseamed is similar to a biological drug that is already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same substance (also called "reference medicinal products").</seg>
<seg id="360">It is used in patients with normal blood pressure values in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion if a blood transfusion is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with Abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases that the medicine is shown.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients wanting to make a blood donation, Abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injections can also be carried out by the patient or his supervisor, provided they have received adequate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams a deciliter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be monitored before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia can be caused by an erythropoietal deficiency or that the body does not respond adequately to the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers the formation of epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared with the reference drug compared to a major study involving 479 patients suffering from renal problems caused by kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected Eprex / Erypo in a vein for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to abseamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of the efficacy was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study investigating the effects of Abseamed injected under the skin with those of Eprex / Erypo at 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study with patients suffering from renal problems caused by kidney problems, the hemoglobin values of patients who were converted to abseamed were maintained in the same degree as those who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">Compared to this, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0,063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of Abseamed is an increase in blood pressure, which may occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, stinging migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as an injection underneath the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for Abseamed according to the requirements of the European Union the evidence was provided that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company that produces abseamed will provide information packages for the medical personnel in all Member States, including information on the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Medice Medicines Pütter GmbH & Co KG to transport Abseamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion demand in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is based on the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, preexisting anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">Treatment should be performed only in patients with moderate anaemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6.2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood-sparing measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger surgical procedures requiring a large blood flow rate (4 or more units blood for women; 5 or more units blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of external blood Abseamed can be applied before a large electro-orthopaedic surgery in adults without iron deficiency, where high risk of transfusion complications is to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and an expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The haemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6.2 - 7,5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients, where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Anemia symptoms and follictions may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="387">An increase in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1,25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed in a patient or below the hemoglobin target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) of up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent haemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permissible dose required for controlling anemia and anemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6,8 g / dl or &lt; 4.25 mmol / l) may require higher maintenance doses than patients in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 6,8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.E. / kg three times a week using an intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.E. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in increments of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Anemia symptoms and - consequential effects may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease burden; therefore, the evaluation of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the physician.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve the hemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6.2 mmol / l) of up to 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epoetin alfa is applied in the lowest permissible dose required for control of anemia symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of hemoglobin value equal to at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the haemoglobin rose &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the reticulocyte force &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be increased to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg three times a week the haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte number has increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the reticulocyte force by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an approach to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be aborted.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anaemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), where the precautionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood konserae is required, Abseamed should receive a body weight of 600 I.E. / kg twice a week for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure.</seg>
<seg id="403">The iron substitution should start as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the autologous blood donation program began, so that large iron reserves are available before the start of the seamed therapy.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.E. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once a week over three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">In this case, epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively, the injection can be given at the end of the dialysis via the hose of a fistula needle, followed by 10 ml isotonic saline solution to rinse the hose and ensure sufficient injection of the drug into the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients who suffer from any erythropoetin at a erythroblastophenia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) should not receive an abseamed or another erythropoetin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastoenie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thromboembolism (e.g. anamnestically known venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">The application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in patients suffering from an autologous blood donation program: severe coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the otid or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with a recent heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblastophenia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an anti-body-mediated PRCA after monate- to years of treatment with subcutanem erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of activity, defined as reduction of haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the reticulocyte value should be determined and the usual causes of failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminiuminous toxicity, infections or inflammation, blood loss and haemolysis) are examined.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reticulocyte value, taking into account the anaemia (i.e. the reticuloyte "index"), is reduced (&lt; 20,000 / mm3 or &lt; 20,000 / microlitre or &lt; 0.5%), the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone marrow should be considered for the diagnosis of a PRCA.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data for immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of Abseamed in patients with a risk for an anti-body induced PRCA (patients with renal anemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">In clinical trials, an increased risk of mortality and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when erythropoesis-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the administration of epoetin if the haemoglobin concentration is increased via the concentration required for the control of the anemia symptoms and the avoidance of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The haemoglobin increase should amount to approximately 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of high blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive heart failure, the upper limit of the hemoglobin target concentration recommended in Section 4.2 should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are still not dialysis, will not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients receiving chemotherapy, epoetin alfa should be considered a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and erythropoetin response (patients who may have to be transacted).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is exceeded 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or a b-value of 13 g / dl (8.1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thrombotic events (see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapic anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetine should be based on a benefit-risk assessment involving the respective patient, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">For patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery, if possible, prior to the beginning of epoetin alfa therapy, the cause of anaemia should be examined and treated accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, as they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, an increased risk of post-operative thrombotic / vascular events may not be excluded in case of treatment with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial hemoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled trials, epoetin was not proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptomatic anaemia or reduce the risk of tumour progression.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, when a haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was aspired</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels of Ciclosporin should be controlled and the Ciclosporin dosage should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumour tissue there are no indications of an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, cerebral thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysms, retinalthrombosis, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under erythropoetin therapy, as well as patients under epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most frequent side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>
<seg id="432">Increased incidence of thrombovascular events (see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General) was observed in patients under treatment with erythropoetine.</seg>
<seg id="433">Regardless of erythropoetin therapy, it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thrombotic and vascular complications.</seg>

<seg id="546">If you are cancer patients, consider that Abseamed can act like a growth factor for blood cells and may have a negative impact on the tumor.</seg>
<seg id="547">If you prefer a major orthopaedic surgery, you should investigate the cause of your anaemia before the start of treatment with Abseamed.</seg>
<seg id="548">If your values of the red blood dye (haemoglobin) are too high, you should not get Abseamed because there is an increased risk of bleeding after the surgery.</seg>

<seg id="552">Depending on how your blood pressure (anemia) appeals to the treatment, the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until your condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="553">Your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure the drug works correctly and your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="554">Once you are well tuned, you get regular doses of abseamed between 25 and 50 I.E. / kg twice a week, spread on two equally large injections.</seg>
<seg id="555">Your doctor may arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and make sure that your hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value.</seg>
<seg id="556">Depending on how anaemia refers to treatment, the dose can be adjusted for about every four weeks until the condition is under control.</seg>
<seg id="557">To ensure this and ensure that the hemoglobin value does not exceed a certain value, the doctor treating the haemoglobin will carry out regular blood tests.</seg>
<seg id="558">If it is necessary to shorten the treatment time before surgery, a dose of 300 I.E. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery, on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after surgery.</seg>
<seg id="559">However, if your doctor thinks this is appropriate for you, also learn how to sprat Abseamed itself under the skin.</seg>
<seg id="560">Heart, heart attacks, cerebral haemorrhages, strokes, temporary circulatory disorders of the brain, deep venous thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, pulmonary thrombosis, thrombosis (aneurysms), thrombosis of the retina and blood clots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients under erythropoetin therapy.</seg>
<seg id="561">Eyelids and lips (Quincke eyelids) and shock-like allergic reactions with symptoms such as tingling, redness, itching, heat sensation, and accelerated pulse have been reported in rare cases.</seg>
<seg id="562">Erythroblastophenia means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone marrow (see section "Special caution when using Abseamed").</seg>
<seg id="563">After repeated blood donations it can come - regardless of the treatment with Abseamed - to a drop of blood (thrombotic vascular events).</seg>
<seg id="564">The treatment with Abseamed can be associated with increased risk of blood prop after surgery (post-operative thrombotic vascular events) when your initial hemoglobin value is too high</seg>

<seg id="567">Acupa is used to treat the following diseases: • Osteoporosis (a disease that makes the bones brittle) both in women after menopause and in men.</seg>
<seg id="568">It is used in patients with a high fracture risk (bone fractures), including patients who have recently suffered a minor traumatic hip fracture like in Hinfall; • Morbus Paget of the bone, a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth.</seg>
<seg id="569">In addition, patients with Morbus Paget should take at least 500 mg of calcium daily for at least 10 days after the treatment; patients with hip fracture should receive a large dose of vitamin D (50 000 to 125 000 IE) orally or by injection into a muscle before the first infusion.</seg>
<seg id="570">The administration of paracetamol or ibuprofen (remedy against inflammation) shortly after the application of Acupa may reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after infusion such as fever, muscle pain, flu-like symptoms, joint pain and headache.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 men and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who recently had a hip fracture; the number of fractures was examined over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In Paget, Acupa was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">Main indicator of the efficacy was whether the saline of alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood re-normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study with older women, the risk of fractures in patients under Acupa (without any other osteoporosis) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Acupa (with or without osteoporosis) the risk of hip fractures was reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study with men and women with hip fracture 9% of patients under Acupa had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients under placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most side effects of Acupa occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Acupa may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronacid or other bisphosphonates or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients with aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion point and osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Acupa manufactures reconnaissance material for doctors who prescribe Acupa for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains information on how to apply the medicine, as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the drug are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit for the company Novartis Europharm Limited to approve Acupa in the entire European Union.</seg>

<seg id="587">The patient information package is to be provided and the following core messages include: • The packaging supplement • Concontraindication in pregnancy and nursing women • Supplementary physical activity, non-smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to access medical or nursing care</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment • in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk for fractures, including patients with a litty low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, intravenous infusion of 5 mg aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the infusion of acetate is recommended for two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget Accura should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">Following a treatment by the Morbus Paget with Acupa, a long period of remission was observed in patients who responded to therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Acupa (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a litty low-traumatic hip fracture an initial dose of 50,000 to 125.000 I.E. orally or intramuscular vitamin D is recommended before the first acetate infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Acupa may be reduced by using paracetamol or ibuprofen shortly after the use of acetamol.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorders (see section 4.4) In patients with a creatinin-clearance &lt; 35 ml / min Acupa is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this group of patients is available.</seg>
<seg id="597">Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in elderly patients is similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Accura are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age because data is lacking for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="599">Acupa is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure (Kreatinin-Clearance &lt; 35 ml / min) because there are limited clinical experience for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">A pre-existing hypokalemia is to be treated with acetate by adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D prior to the start of the therapy (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid settling of the effect of Zoledronacid on bone reconstruction, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokalemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Acupa (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elemental calcium, for at least 10 days after the administration of Acupa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, corticosteroids (bad oral hygiene) should be treated with appropriate preventive dentistry before applying bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who need dental intervention, no data is available whether the interruption of treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteoporosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the treatment of acetamol or ibuprofen can be reduced shortly after the use of acetamol (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of atrial fibrillation reported as serious adverse effects was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to those receiving placebo (0.6%) (22 from 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial [RFT]), the overall frequency of atrial fibrillation between Acupa (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) undesirable drug interactions are listed in table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction Zoledronacid was associated with renal dysfunctions, which referred to as a decrease in the renal function (i.e. an increase of serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the creatine clearance (measured annually before the administration) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a limited kidney function were comparable in a clinical study of osteoporosis over three years comparable to the Aclasta- and placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatinins within 10 days after administration was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Acupa compared to 0.8% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings, the temporary asymptomatic calcium values occurred below the normal fluctuation range (less than 2.10 mmol / l), in 2.3% of patients treated with Acupa in a large clinical study compared to 21% of patients treated with Acupa in the Morbus Paget studies.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for postmenopausal osteoporosis in the study on the prevention of clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget studies (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study to avoid clinical fractures after a littlitty hip fracture, the vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of Acupa (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions After the administration of Zoledronacid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the infusion site such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecroses in the jaw area were frequently reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecroses (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronacid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental attacks.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 study with 7,736 patients underwent osteoarthritis in the maxillary area of a patient treated with Acupa and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the event of overdose which leads to a clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by applying oral calcium and / or intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical efficacy in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of acetate 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years has been shown with either a bone density (BMD) -T score for the string neck ≤ -1.5 and at least two light or a medium-heavy existing eddy body fracture or a BMD-T score for the string neck ≤ -2.5 with or without signs of an existing eddy body fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric spine fractures Accura significantly decreased over a period of three years as well as the frequency of one or more new vertebral fractures after one year (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Acupa treated patients aged 75 and older had a 60% reduced risk of vertebral fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Accura showed a consistent effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures by 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) aclasta significantly increased bone density on lumbar vertebrac acid, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase bone density of lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip increased by 6.0%, the thigh by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology in 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Acupa (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70) were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies from the pelvic base.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the retention of the trabecular bone architecture compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of type I- collagen (P1NP) in serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups from 517 to 1,246 patients in periodic intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5mg dose of Acupa was significantly reduced by 30% compared to the initial value and was held at 28% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 52% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below the initial value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the initial value of up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">The vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125.000 I.E. orally or intramuscular) 2 weeks before infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">Total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the group treated with Acupa compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON RFT study, the Acupa treatment increased BMD compared to placebo treatment at the overall level and scarves at all times.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Acupa treatment led to an increase of BMD by 5.4% over 24 months compared to placebo treatment by 5.4% in total weight and 4.3% at the lower leg.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical efficacy in males In the HORIZON RFT study, 508 men were randomized and in 185 patients the BMD was evaluated after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Acupa-treated males compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in males (study CZOL446M2308), the once-weekly administration of Acupdronate was not inferior to the percentage change of lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical efficacy of the treatment with Morbus Paget of the bone Acupa was examined in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radiologically confirmed, mostly light to moderately heavy Morbus Paget of the bone (median serum levels of alkaline phosphatase in accordance with 2.6x to 3.1 fold-specific upper normal value when recording in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The efficacy of an infusion of 5 mg of zoledronacid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day during 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for Acupa and Risedronat.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as Responder at the end of the six-month main study were eligible for follow-up.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 with aclasta and the 107 patients treated with risedronate, the therapeutic approach of 141 of patients treated with acetate could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">Singular and multiple 5 and 15 minutes of infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg of zoledron acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dosed independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that, the plasma levels quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1% after 24 h followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life time t ½ α 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long eliminatory phase with a terminal eliminatory time t ½ γ 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early stages of distribution (α and β, with the above mentioned ½ -values) probably represent the fast resorption in the bones and the excretion over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours, 39 ± 16% of the administered dose can be found in the urine, whereas the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body-clearance is independent of the dose 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains unaffected by gender, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of the Zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion, but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration at time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A reduced clearance by cytochrome P450 enzyme systems is unlikely because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, metabolic dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Specific patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of zoledronacid correlated with the creatinine clearance, namely 75 ± 33% of the creatinine clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min (range 22 to 143 ml / min) in the 64 examined patients.</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in an easy (Clcr = 50- 80 ml / min) and moderate kidney dysfunction down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adaptation of zoledronacid required.</seg>
<seg id="655">Since severe renal dysfunction (Kreatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min) is only limited, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-Latvian intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and a body weight of 0.6 mg / kg for rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs, single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on AUC the 6times of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, well and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application was given the renal tolerability of zoledronacid in rats, taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15-minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dosage that corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated application in accumulated expositions sufficiently exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects occurred in other organs including gastrointestinal tract and liver, as well as on the intravenous injection site.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent occurrence in studies with repeated application was an increased primary Spongiosa in the metaphyse of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all dosages, an infection that reflects the pharmacological, anti-absorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats one observed a teratogenicity in dosages of 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">In rabbits no teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed, although the maternal toxicity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg due to the reduced serum-calcium levels.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronacid is a representative of a class of substance called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, osteoporosis in men and the mortality of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, above all estrogens that are made from androgens, play a role in the more gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget the bone reconstruction is too fast, and new bone material is built insubordinated, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Acupa works by normalising bone reconstruction, ensuring normal bone formation and reinforces the bone again.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Acupa.</seg>
<seg id="676">When using Acupa with other medicines Please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / apply other medicines or have been used / used recently, even if they are not prescription drugs.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Beverage Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the application of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). it can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="751">In addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), it can be applied not satisfactorily using metformin alone in the highest tolerable dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with a sulfonylic acid or insulin, the previous dose of the sulfonylic acid or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the Actos treatment, except for patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of the sulfonylic acid or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, allowing type 2 diabetes to be better adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of actos in tripletherapy was studied; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylic resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">In the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos led to a reduction in the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were lowered by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg in the case of dosages.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the trial, the effect of an additional dose of methformin and a sulfonylic acid in a reduction in HbA1c values was 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study investigating the combination of actos and insulin in 289 patients, the patients receiving actos additionally showed a decrease in HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common adverse events related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypothesiology (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or one of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high concentration of ketone - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It was decided that Actos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not shown.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit for the takeover of Actos in the entire European Union by Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited.</seg>

<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficient with insulin and is unsuitable for metformin due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">For use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, no data is available, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients who are at least one risk factor (e.g. heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the physician should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose stepwise.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed on signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, an increase in reports on heart failure, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased output of liver enzyme (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, Pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT mirrors are elevated up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that indicate a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, the liver enzyme values are to be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision whether the patient's treatment is continued with Pioglitazone should be guided by clinical assessment to the outcome of the laboratory parameters.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical trials with Pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven that can move from fatty deposits and is associated with a fluid retention in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="776">A slight reduction of the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred as a result of hemodilution.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of haemoglobin by 3-4% and hematocrits by 3-2% and hematocrits by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia is the risk of a dose-dependent hypoglycaemia in patients who receive pioglitazone as oral 2 or triple combination therapy with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, treatment with Thiazolidindione, including pioglitazone, was reported about a occurrence or deterioration of a diabetic macular edema with a reduction in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but concordant physicians should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of visual acuity; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events with regard to fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with over 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy, and if a patient wants a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is reduced (see Section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies on the interactions have shown that pioglitazone has no relevant effects on pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with drugs that are metabolized by these enzymes, e.g. oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductinhibitors are not expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous use of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a Cytochrom P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC from Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperplinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very often &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100; rare &gt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not invaluable from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change in the turgor and the index of the lens, as observed in other hypoglycemic substances.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with Pioglitazone ALT-Anstiege exceeded the three-fold of the upper limit of the normal range as often as under placebo, but more rarely than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyreside.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an Outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the incidence of severe heart failure in pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than under placebo when Pioglitazon bzw.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch it has rarely been reported on heart failure under Pioglitazone, but more often when pioglitazone has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomised, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients in the groups treated with pioglitazone and more than 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medications.</seg>
<seg id="796">Over a period of 3.5 years of ProActive study, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared with 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days did not occur any symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to have an activation of specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ) activated by specific nuclear receptors (PPAR-γ) which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that pioglitazone reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glucose analysis in case of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with Pioglitazone versus Gliclazid as monotherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time up to the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 8.0%) was maintained by pioglitazone in 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclazid).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficient despite three months of optimization with insulin had been randomized to Pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazone the mean HbA1c decreased by 0.45% compared to those who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the treated group was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was examined in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL- cholesterol levels as well as minor, but clinically not significantly elevated LDL- cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone reduced overall plasmatriglycerides compared to placebo, metformin or gliclazid, and the free fatty acids and increased the HDL cholesterol.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone, while values decreased under Metformin and Gliclazid.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the net triglycerides but also improved the post-dendial increased triglyceride level, which affects the triglycerid absorption and hepatic triglycerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the Proactive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is quickly absorbed, whereby the top concentrations of unaltered pioglitazone are usually achieved within 2 hours of application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV corresponds to the effectiveness in approximately three times the effectiveness of Pioglitazone whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, pioglitazone has no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic or pharmaceutical dynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous use of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with Rifampicin (a Cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or reduces the plasma concentration of pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">According to the oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The average plasma elimination time of unaltered pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolite is 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects, but the rates of oral clearances of the parent substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys occurred after repeated administration of plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anaemia and reversible excentric cardiac hypertrophy.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that under treatment with pioglitazone the hyperplinemia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are reduced and the availability of the metabolic substrates for fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years), increased incidence of hyperplasia (male and female rats) and tumours (male rats) of the urinary bladder epithelium were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of the family adenomatous polyposis (FAP), the treatment with two other thiazolidindian resulted in increased frequency of colon tumours.</seg>

<seg id="823">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 fractures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events, fractures occurred at 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study of two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin, each with pioglitazone or gliclazid were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, Pioglitazone showed a statistically significant decrease in the albumin / creatinin quotients compared to the initial values.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, Pioglitazone not only reduced the net triglycerides, but also improved the post-dendial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on Tryglyceride absorption and hepatic tryglizerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study lacked the objective of its primary endpoint, which presented a combination of total mortality, non-lethal myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary artery syndrome, leg amputation just above the ankles, coronary vascularisation and Revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that no cardiovascular long-time risks are associated with taking Pioglitazone.</seg>

<seg id="864">Actraphane has been studied in a total of 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="865">The study measured the concentration of a substance (glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) after 12 weeks which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="866">Actraphane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, indicating that the blood glucose levels were lowered as much as with another human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="867">Actraphane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">The doses of Actraphane may also be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package template).</seg>

<seg id="1181">If the level of serum levels is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase can be taken into account at ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x a day.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe kidney function restriction, efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated (Creatinin- Clearance &lt; 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and young people Since there is no experience in children and adolescents, the use of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Organ transplant receiver Since there is no experience in organ transplant receivers, the application of Febuxostat is not recommended in this group of patients (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular disease In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure, treatment with Febuxostat is not recommended (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other resinous drugs, acute gout attacks can occur during the treatment process, because the reduction of the serum harrow acid level may initially mobilise uric acid deposits in the tissues.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. in malignant diseases and their treatment (Lesch- Nyhan-Syndrome), the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases is likely to rise so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver disease During Phase 3 clinical trials, slight abnormalities of liver function values were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before starting the febuxostator treatment and in the further course according to clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophyllin was no interaction studies carried out at Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibiting can lead to an increase in theophylline level (a inhibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects, the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and Naproxen was 250 mg twice daily with an increase in febuxostatexposition (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical studies the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase of adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / Indometacin / hydrochlorothiazide / warfarin Febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin without having a dosage adjustment for Febuxostat or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with test subjects, 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily showed an increase of the AUC from Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, indicating a possible faint inhibitory effect of Febuxostat to the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antasia containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide, delays the intake of fiebuxostat (around 1 hour) and a decrease in Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in AUC.</seg>

<seg id="1198">Patients should be cautious when controlling a vehicle, operating machinery or when performing dangerous activities until they can reasonably be sure that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">A numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported by the investigator was observed in the overall febuxostator group in the pivotal study of Phase 3 (1.3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors determined in these patients were an arteriosclerotic condition and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100), occasional (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000) side effects that could be related to the medicine and reported in all baseblint treatment groups more than once, are listed below.</seg>

<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x a day; 10 patients with serum creatine &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x a day.</seg>
<seg id="1218">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with kidney function restriction The APEX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction (D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC, the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum harnacid concentrations in subjects, despite their renal function (58% in group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">The primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum harnacid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX and FACT study) had a serum-acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl at the beginning of the study (baseline).</seg>
<seg id="1222">The data gathered in two years of the Phase 3 open extension study showed that the reduction of the serum levels of serum levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) showed a decrease in the incidence of poison gas in the months 16-24 (i.e. more than 97% of patients did not need any treatment against rheumatism).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of gout, which resulted in a complete disappearance of the gout knot up to month 24 in 54% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH- values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received Allopurinol (5.8%) in the open long-term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers, the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) from Febuxostat increased doses ranging from 10 mg to 120 mg dose.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses of 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in AUC is observed for Febuxostat, which is greater than the dose-proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day, the Cmax is about 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant change was observed in the percentage decline of serum hardening concentration, provided that this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady-state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma microtein binding of Febuxostat amounts to about 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration range, which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that these oxidative metabolites are predominantly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronide mainly occurs through UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose was found in the urine as unaltered fideluxeate (3%), the known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) as well as other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion over the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the chair was found as unaltered fieblint (12%), Acylglukuronid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) as well as other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>

<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) was found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed treated group, with approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of a specific purinmetabolism and urine composition and are considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">It has been found that Febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were about 4 times the human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied a reduction in the performance and a development delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day, which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">Since Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union, the company presented data originating from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis in order to prove the efficacy of ADROVANCE in regards to the increase in vitamin D spies.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15 week treatment, the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower (11%) compared to those treated with ADROVANCE (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data suggesting that the Alendronat dose contained in ADROVANCE corresponds exactly to the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pain of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), ulcers (ulceration), ulcers (ulceration), aborted abdomen (bloated abdomen) as well as acidic uprisings.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any other component, ADROVANCE may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="1284">It may not be used in case of diseases of the oesophagus, in patients with hypocalcemia (low calcium levels) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following hints are exactly to be followed to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• The patients should not chew the tablet or let the tablet melt in the mouth because there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulcera. • Patients should not lie before the first food intake of the day, which should take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcer, active gastrointestinal hemorrhages or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract except pyloroplasty are given only under special caution (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions, such as esophagitis, esophageal ulcerations and esophageal erosions, were reported in patients taking alendronate (partially these were severe and requiring hospitalisation).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible malignant reactions, and the patients should be advised to suspend symptoms of severe irritation such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or retroactive pain or new or worsening heartburn (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe adverse side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or after the occurrence of symptoms that indicate an abophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">Whereas in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronat no increased risk was detected, stomach and duodenal ulcerations were rare (after market launch), some of which were severe and complications, reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoarthritis of the jaw, usually associated with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection (including osteomyelitis), has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy regime contains predominantly intravenous bisphosphonates.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available that indicate whether the replacement of bisphosphonate therapy in patients requiring a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for the therapy planning of each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after they noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets on the same day, but continue taking one tablet a week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting the metabolism of minerals (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated with ADROVANCE before the treatment begins.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines may affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Therefore, after taking Alendronat, patients have to wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines (see Sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not performed, Alendronate was used in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is only intended for use in postmenopausal women and is therefore not to be applied either during pregnancy or lactating women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronate do not indicate directly harmful effects with regard to the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoarthritis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most of the reports are from cancer patients, but osteoporosis was also reported.</seg>

<seg id="1410">Only doctors who are familiar with immunosuppressive therapy and the treatment of transplant patients should prescribe this medicine or make changes to immunosuppressive therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of Tacrolimus this can lead to graft rejection or increased incidence of side effects, including under- or hyperimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1413">Following a change to an alternative formulation, therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of tacrolimus remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="1414">The dosage of adventif should primarily be based on clinical assessment of impact and tolerability in individual cases and on blood level regulations (see below "Recommendations</seg>
<seg id="1415">After switching from Prograf to Advagraf, the Tacrolimus levels should be checked before the changeover and over two weeks after changeover.</seg>
<seg id="1416">On Day 4, systemic exposure, measured as level mirror, was comparable to both kidney and liver transplanted patients.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated inspections of the Tacrolimus levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under adventif to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate night transplant phase.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Because tacrolimus is a low-clearance substance, an adjustment of the adventif can take several days until the Steady State is reached.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - conversion from Prograf to Advantf must be a transplant recipient of twice daily dosage of Prograf capsules to a once daily intake of Advagraph, so this conversion has to be done in ratio 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the total daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplantation After switching from other immunosuppressiva to Advagraph once a day, the treatment with the oral initials recommended in kidney and liver transplant must begin for prophylaxis of graft rejection.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Heart transplant in adult patients who are converted to adventils is to take a oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day a day in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients though there is no clinical experience with adventif in pulmonary, pancreatic and colorectal transplanted patients with an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood levels in the targeted area may be necessary in patients with severe liver function disorders a reduction of the dose.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the renal function does not affect the pharmacokinetics of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">Due to the nephrotoxic potential of Tacrolimus, however, careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum levels of serum levels, a calculation of the creatine level and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Changeover from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporine to a Tacrolimus-based therapy caution is advised (see Sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of graft rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of full blood Tacrolimus levels controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tacrolimus levels during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic checks during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood levels of Tacrolimus should also be controlled after changeover from Prograf to Advagraf, Dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or with simultaneous use of substances which could change the tacrolimus full blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since adventif is a medication with a low clearance, adaptations of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has entered.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Indications in clinical studies suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases when the level of the blood does not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the levels of Tacrolimus in full blood are usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with adrenal and heart transplanted patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the following maintenance therapy of liver, kidney and heart transplant recipients, blood concentrations were generally used in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events, including graft rejection or other side effects, which may occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; changes in the formulation or regime should only be carried out under the close-meshed control of a physician experienced in the transplant (see Sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be resistant to other immunosuppressants, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1442">In order to prophylactic graft rejection in adult heart transplant recipients and transplant recipients in childhood, there are no clinical data for the retarded formulation of Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Due to possible interactions which may result in a reduction of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of Tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other herbal remedies during treatment with adventif (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus levels in the blood is offered, as the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases, under Prograf a beta or septum hypertrophy was observed under Prograf, which can therefore occur under anagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver function disorders, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, the effect of sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of malignant skin lesions due to suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>
<seg id="1448">If patients who take Tacrolimus show symptoms of PRES such as headaches, altered states of consciousness, convulsions and blurred vision, a radiological examination (e.g..</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can influence the metabolism of Tacrolimus and thus increase or decrease the blood values of Tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">It is therefore recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while adding substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus dose accordingly to maintain uniform concentrations (see Sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1452">A highly pronounced interaction was associated with antifungal agents such as ketoconazole, fluconazole, istraconazole and voriconazole as well as with the Macrod antibiotic erythromycin and HIV protease inhibitors (z).</seg>
<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly results from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, due to the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Highly dosed prednisolone or methyl prednisolone, as is used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of Tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines tacrolimus is known as a CYP3A4 inhibitor; therefore, the simultaneous use of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because tacrolimus reduce the clearance of steroid-contraceptives and thus increase hormonal exposure, it is especially cautious when making decisions on contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially lessen the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>
<seg id="1458">The results of a small number of tests on transplant patients do not indicate that under Tacrolimus in comparison to other immunosuppressants, there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1459">In utero exposure, a monitoring of the newborn is recommended for possible harmful effects of tacrolimus (especially regarding its effect on the kidneys).</seg>

<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, Tacrolimus can not be dialyzed.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Action mechanism and pharmacodynamic effects At the molecular level, the effects of Tacrolimus are expected to be mediated by binding to a cytosolitic protein (FKBP12) which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cell nucleus.</seg>

<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit value and low protein concentrations, which lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of Tacrolimus, or an amplification of the metabolism caused by corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion mainly occurs across the bile.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advate is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting disorder caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of the application depends on whether advate is used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with hemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, causing blood clotting problems such as bleeding in joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but is produced using a method called recombinant DNA technology:</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, which it empowers the formation of the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Advate is similar to another drug approved in the European Union named Recombinate, but is made differently so the medicine does not contain any proteins or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate hemophilia A, including a study involving 53 children under six years, the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">The main study evaluated the efficacy of advate in the prevention of bleeding in 86% of 510 new blood vessels with "excellent" or "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of advate (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headache, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">Advate may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to human coagulation factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission granted Baxter AG a licence for the placing of advate in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, on the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the standard or I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injections every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the treatment course, appropriate determination of factor VIII plasma is recommended for controlling the dose and the frequency of injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their response to Factor VIII in order to achieve different in vivo recovery and have different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prophylaxis for long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight within 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected factor VIII plasma activity is not reached or if bleeding is not ruled by an appropriate dose, a test must be carried out in order to detect an inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures need to be studied.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The dosing speed should follow after the patient has been diagnosed with a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a well-known complication in the treatment of patients with hemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always immune to the prokoagulatory activity of factor VIII IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml Plasma using modified Bethesda Assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors is related to the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the largest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pre-treated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 expositions and anamnestically known inhibitors development, after switching from a recombinant Factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of haemophilia A in women there are no experiences about the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">ADRs were inhibitors against factor VIII (5 patients), all of which had previously untreated patients with a higher risk of forming inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated based on the sum of the individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood coagulation factor VIII-Spiegels occurred postoperatively (10 - 14 postoperatively day) in one patient under continuous aDVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">The blood clotting was maintained throughout the period and both the factor VIII- mirror in the plasma and the Clearance rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th postoperative day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical trials with ADVATE to 145 children and adults 2 with a diagnosis of severe to moderate hemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to Factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days), only one patient after 26 expositions with ADVATE showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach).</seg>

<seg id="1562">Previously untreated patients from a ongoing clinical study comprised 5 of 25 (20%) with ADVATE treated patients inhibitors against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminating proteins was analyzed by investigating the antibody titer against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed a statistically significant upward trend as well as an ongoing peak of the antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms indicating an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="1565">In four patients the incidence of urticaria, uritus, rash and increased number of eosinophiles granulocytes were reported in several repeated product expositions within the study.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP still has rated the benefit risk assessment as positive, but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, on the basis of the safety profile of ADVATE, which necessitates a submission of PSURs every 6 months, the CHMP has decided to apply for further extension procedures in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company will withdraw its application for the treatment of advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Normally, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft tissues (tissues that connect and support other structures in the body) are affected by this.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified to carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus does not trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advexin would have been injected directly into the tumors and thus allow cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein again.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein produced from the non-defective p53 gene in the human body usually contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In the case of Li-Fraumeni cancer, where the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein is not working properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study involving a patient with Li-Fraumeni's cancer in the area of the substructure, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP had reviewed the answers of the company to the questions asked, there were still some questions unsolved.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the examination of the initial submitted documents, the CHMP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni-Tumore brings benefits to patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">Moreover, the company had not adequately proven that advexin can be manufactured in a reliable manner and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notice CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients participating in clinical trials or "compassionate-use" programs with advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "changed drug release" "" "means that the tablets are composed so that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat the symptoms of the seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal pathways caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucous membrane swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminate as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clamped.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be traced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main effective measures were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">Considering all the hay fever symptoms, apart from constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in the patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26,7% in the patients who received the Lenses alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity, anorexia (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disturbances and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to diloratadine, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic active substances or lauatins (another drug for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients suffering from hypertension (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hypertension) or hypertension (hypertension caused by cerebral haemorrhage).</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the SP Europe company to approve the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but is swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data, the Aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days because the activity of pseudoephedrine can decrease over time for long-term use.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory passages, treatment can be continued with desloratadine as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Since aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors or within the 2 weeks after completion of such therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is attributable to the alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, damurid, cabergolin, ergotamine, Dihydroergotamine or other deongestiva, which can be used as phenylpropanolamine, phenylephrine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, nhazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient's collective and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not checked in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are not sufficient to address appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients must be informed that the treatment of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea, or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of the headache) must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups caution is recommended: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck obstruction or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is required at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, since antihistamines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In the course of clinical exams with Lloratadine, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered, however, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of desloratadine were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with desloratadine and the patients treated with placebo, regardless of whether the loratadine alone or with alcohol was taken.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the loratadine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vitro studies did not inhibit CYP3A4 and in vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit and neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins is.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The harmlessness of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not guaranteed, but experiences from a large number of affected pregnancies did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be used during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">However, patients should be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness which may result in an impairment of traffic ability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The symptoms may vary between a CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and a CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremor, convulsions) with potential Latvian gradients.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, complicated miction, muscle weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, arousal, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disturbances, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precortical pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, visual disturbances and hypertension or hypotony.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropin-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupil rigid and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles and the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured variables of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical trials, no increased frequency of drowsiness compared to placebo was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">There were 1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies the histamine antagonistic effectiveness of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The efficacy of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect determined by nasal mucous swelling was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with diloratadine over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerinaze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender, age or ethnic origin.</seg>
<seg id="1697">In the context of a single dose study of the pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadine is detectable within 30 minutes after administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the peroral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the floating equilibrium of distillates, 3-hydroxydesloratine and pseudoephedrine was reached on day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">Within the framework of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four test subjects were poorly metabolized.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bio equivalent was exposed to exposure according to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with Desloratadin does not recognize any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination had no greater toxicity than its individual components, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient Pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies, the combination of lauatadine / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application, the pharmaceutical vigilance system has been established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the relief of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's own substance, its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1717">After the market launch of Desloratadin, very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling atching, itching, hives, swelling) or skin rashes have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">About cases of palpitations, heart hunting, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, drowsiness, sleep disorders, muscle aches, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspicuous liver enzymes was also very rare.</seg>

<seg id="1720">For children aged 1 to 5 years, the dose is 1.25 mg once a day, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children aged six to eleven, the dose is 2.5 mg once a day, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies in patients who also had asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by determining the change in symptoms (itching, number and size of squads, impairment of sleep and performance on day) before and after six weeks treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the syrup, the solution for insertion and the fusion tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, when the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg Aerius resulted in an average decrease of the symptom scores (symptom scores) by 25 to 32% compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in patients receiving placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies at Urtikaria the decrease of the symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67% was compared to 40 and 33% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadine, laucomine, or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued a permit for the establishment of Aerius in the entire European Union by SP Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate symptoms in allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies proving efficacy in the use of distillates in young people aged 12 to 17 (see Sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks) should be performed according to the disease progression and can be stopped after the symptoms have been removed and resumed.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks), a continuous treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy period.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with Desloratadine tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were administered additionally (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinical pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">However, patients should be informed that it can occur in very rare cases of dizziness, which may lead to impairment of traffic jams or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more side-effects were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were tiredness (1.2%), oral dry (0.8%) and headaches (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">A clinical study involving 578 youthful patients aged 12 to 17 was the most common side effect headaches, this occurred at 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadine and at 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of diloratadine (nine-time clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes the inhibition of the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles and the inhibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P-selectin to endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">No statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses at which desloratadine was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinical pharmacological study, in which Desloratadin was administered at a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, no extension of the Qtc interval was shown.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, the Lloratadine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measured variables of the flight performance, including the amplification of subjective drowsiness or the tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in relieving symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching the nose, itching, lacrimal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis may alternatively also be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As shown on the basis of the overall score of the questionnaire regarding quality of life in Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology is similar in the different forms, and chronic patients can be easily recruited in a prospectively way.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine removal is a causative factor in all age-related diseases, it is expected that as a result of chronic idiopathic urticaria, it is also expected to improve the symptoms in other forms of urticaria; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving the size and number of squads at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the majority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines were excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">An improvement in itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratine compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">The treatment with Aerius reduced the disturbance of sleep and wakefulness, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluation of these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study, where patients with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population were comparable, 4% of patients achieved a higher concentration of diloratas.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of diloratadine (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the enloratadine has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>

<seg id="1893">In June 2008 Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. also officially approved the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for authorisation for the transport of Aflunov to prevent the aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that is intended to protect against a strain of the flu virus that might cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">Influenza pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily be spread by humans to humans, because people still have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">After administration of the vaccine, the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus as "foreign" in the vaccine and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">As a result, the immune system is later able to produce antibodies in contact with an influenza virus of this trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane layer of the virus with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface, which the human body recognises as a body-foreign), was purified and used as a component of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">The scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you are interested in a clinical trial and require further information about your treatment, please contact your attending doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like more information on the basis of CHMP's recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>

<seg id="1905">Agenerase is available as a solution for patients who cannot swallow the capsules, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir because the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Ashease should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which antiviral drug the patient has taken before, and the likelihood of the virus to respond to the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg kritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children aged between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of agroase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">Agenerase reduces the HIV amount in the blood when combined with other antiviral medicines and keeps them at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not to cure AIDS, however, can delay the damage of the immune system and thus also the development of HIV-related infections and diseases.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agroase was studied in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had previously not been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">The drug Agenerase increased with low dose kritonavir was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who had previously taken protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non-detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the alteration of the viral load after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In the studies with patients who had previously had no protease inhibitors, after 48 weeks of asgenerase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo, but Agenerase was less effective than Indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the burden of virusload, but the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors were very few on the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study with adults who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1917">In patients with HIV, which had been resistant to four other protease inhibitors, degenerase together with Ritonavir came to a stronger drop in the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients receiving their previous protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (flatulence), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue (tiredness).</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agroase may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amponavir or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase may not be used in patients, the carob (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or medicines that are degraded just like asphyase and are harmful to health in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, patients who take adepose are the risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of the body fat), osteoarthritis (death of bone tissue) or an immune reactivation syndrome (symptoms of infection caused by the rejuvenating immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that in combination with other antiretroviral medicines used in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetical amplifier kritonavir, but the committee found that the use of ashease in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors is not proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agroase was originally" "" "approved" "" "under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information is available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Limited, which is approved by the European Commission.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered for pharmacokinetic boosting of amponavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see Sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amponavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre-treatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amponavir as a solution for intake is 14% less than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not exchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amponavir twice daily along with 100 mg kritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of kritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amponavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a day-maximum dose of 2400 mg amonavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">Pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of agroase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agroase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age, due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Simultaneous use is to be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase must not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present the mediums of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be applied because of the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amponavir while taking Amdetavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that aserase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure for HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The present antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with agroase, does not hinder the risk of transmission of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of kritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral medicines (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of serious liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antiviral treatment of hepatitis B or C, please read the relevant information about this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function, including chronic-active hepatitis, show an increased frequency of liver function disorders under an antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous use of agroase and kritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids, which are metabolized via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment predominate the risk of systemic corticosteroid effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal kidney function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Since the metabolism of the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, a simultaneous administration of asterase with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Normalised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take this medicine at the same time, amatease can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amponavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amponavir, the efficacy of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is simultaneously given with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored on opium retreat symptoms, especially if there are also low doses of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Because of the potential risk of toxicity due to the high propyl alcohol content of the Agenerase solution, this formulation is contraindicated in children under an age of four years and should be used with caution in certain other groups of patients.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set to 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors were reported on the occurrence of diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an excazerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other illnesses related to their therapy medications that are associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycaemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. increased age, and with drug-dependent factors, such as a longer lasting antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In the case of hematmophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports of an increase in haemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematoma and hematthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (ART) which leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial aetiology is assumed (including the use of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index) cases of osteoarthritis are reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV-disease and / or long-term antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 Substrate with low therapeutic width Agenerase must not be given at the same time with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also present the mediums of the Cytochrom P450-Isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly metabolized via CYP2D6 and are associated with increased plasma levels associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% reduction in the AUC from amponavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with kritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were frequently observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amponavir can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with Johanniskraut (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes the Johanniskraut, the amber mirrors and, if possible, check the virus load and release the Johanniskraut.</seg>
<seg id="1965">A dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nelfinavir is administered together with amponavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">50% increase, for Cmax it is reduced by 30% if kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amponavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials dosages of 600 mg ampprenavir were used twice daily and kritonavir 100 mg twice daily, demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regimen.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% decreases if Amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amponavir in plasma which were achieved twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amdetavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1970">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amponavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosin in combination with didanosine, but it is recommended that the revenues of didanosin and amperase are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, with the gift of Efavirenz in combination with amponavir (600 mg twice daily) and kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dosage adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amponavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, be careful because Delavirdin may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subdivided plasma levels.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amponavir and rifabutin led to an increase in the plasma concentration (AUC) by Rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, reduction of the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended even though there are no clinical data available for this.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with erythromycin in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, but the plasma levels of both drugs may be increased in the case of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazol a day led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazol in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) on the 2.69fold compared to the value observed after 200 mg ketoconazole once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions that are associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with agroase.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other proteasehemia it is advisable that Antazida may not be taken at the same time as agroase, since it can come to resorption dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous use of anticonvulants known as enzyme inductors (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amponavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipin, diltiazem, felodipine, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, nifedipin, ni</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous use of atherase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and intensify the side effects associated with PDE5 inhibitors, including hypotension, visual disturbances and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which kritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days in subjects, the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of ashabase with kritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroids (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are to be expected to increase plasma levels with simultaneous dosing of Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Since plasma levels of these HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these medications is not recommended with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations is recommended up to stabilisation of the mirrors, as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with simultaneous administration of amponavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase should not be used together with orally taken midazolam (see section 4.3), while using parenteral midazolam is advisable while using Agroase.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protein inhibitors indicate a possible increase in plasma levels of Midazolam by 3 to 4 times.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amponavir, patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of opium removal, especially if there are also low doses of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Because of the very low reliability of historic comparisons, there is currently no recommendation to be given how the amponavir- dose can be adjusted when amponavir is administered simultaneously with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase an increased control of the INR (International standard ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional dose of kritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, so alternative methods for contraception are recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended while applying an asterase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of potential use for the mother in comparison with the potential risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactate rats, Amprenavir-related substances have been proven, but it is not known whether ampprenavir is transferred to breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given by the nesting in the uterus to the end of the lactation period Amprenavir, showed a decreased increase of 12 body weight during lactation during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive capacity, was not affected by the administration of Amprenavir to the mother animal.</seg>
<seg id="2003">The harmlessness of asgenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most side effects associated with agroase therapy were mild to moderate, rose early and rarely lead to the treatment break.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether or not they are associated with drug use or other medicines used simultaneously for treating HIV, or whether they are a consequence of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below stem from two clinical trials (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which patients with protease inhibitors received 1200 mg Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication, were performed in more than 1% of the patients as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes (degree 3 to 4).</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with a redistribution of the body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and faal fat tissue, increased intraabdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsot fat accumulation (pins).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Among 113 antiretroviral not treated persons treated with ampprenavir in combination with lamivudine / zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks was observed only one case (Stiernacken) (&lt; 1%).</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, patients under Amprenavir performed 7 cases (3%) compared to 27 patients (11%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with different NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Rashes usually were mild to moderate, erythematous or macullopapal nature, with or without itching and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amponavir had to be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteoarthritis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV disease or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">Patients who received 600 mg Agenerase twice daily along with low dose kritonavir (100 mg twice a day) were similar to those observed under any adepase treatment; an exception formed the increase in triglycerides and CPK values, which were very common in patients who received Agenerase together with low dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In the event of overdose, the patient must observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amponavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral and gag pol- polyproteinformation with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The connection between the activity of amponavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral pre-treated patients with the currently approved Fosamponavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other ritonavir bleached regimens with proteaseinase inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral, non-treated patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir twice daily in the ESS100732 study, virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">A genotypic analysis of the Isolate of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not treated with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, M36I, M46I, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, I85V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the study APV30003 and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) in patients with virological failure over 96 weeks, the following protease inhibitors appeared:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Prototypical interpretation systems based on genotypic resistance testing can be used to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS-AC-11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance as the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, L33F, M36I, I54A / L / M, I84V and L90M in conjunction with a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Based on phenotypic resistance testing, clinical validated phenotypic interpretation systems can be used in combination with genotypic data to estimate the activity of amponavir / kritonavir / kritonavir in patients with protease inhibitors resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically-phenotypical cut-offs (release points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with reduced sensitivity to amponavir associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross-resistance against kritonavir, the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains in general.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data for cross-resistance between amponavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">On the basis of twenty-five antiretroviral therapies previously untreated (one of which showed a resistance against Lopinavir and saquinavir at the start of treatment and another against Tioglavir), Indinavir / Ritonavir (three of 25 isolates), quinavir / Ritonavir (three of 24 Isolates) and Tidenavir / Ritonavir (four of 24 Isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">Contrariwise, Amprenavir reserves its activity against some other proteastical-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The early departure of a failing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mutations within limits that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The evidence of the efficacy of ashease in combination with ritonavir 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI treated adults according to virological failure (600 mg twice daily) and Nukleodanaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly stuffed with low dose kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least another PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-supremacy of APV / Ritonavir in comparison with the SOC-PI group in the Virusload (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-subsurface threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">The evidence of the efficacy of unbridled asterase is based on two uncontrolled trials with a total of 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies, Agenerase solution for intake and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times a day, 20 mg / kg twice daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, with the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose kritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs administered together with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml in a median increase of CD4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefits of" "" "unborn" "" "Agenerase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration the medium duration (Tmax) up to the maximum serum concentration of amponavir is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">50% increase, by contrast, reduced by 30% for Cmax when kritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered together with amponavir (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amponavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC but has no effect on the concentration of amponavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimal concentration in the steady state (Cmin, ss) was unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of the blood circulation into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, with the amount of inbound Amdetavir, which represents the active portion, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While absolute concentration of unbound Amdetavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates during the dosage interval depending on the total-drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3A4 and present a substrate of CYP3A4 must be given with caution when they are given at the same time with agroase (see Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily ampprenavir exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amponavir is made from the solution 14% less bioavailability than from the capsules; therefore, Agenerase solution and Agenerase capsules are not exchangeable on a milligram basis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">Also, the renal clearing of kritonavir is negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction may be limited to the elimination of amponavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These regimens lead to amponavir plasma levels comparable to those obtained in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg ampprenavir twice daily without simultaneous administration of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with ampprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas in dosages occurred in male animals, which correspond to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3,8- fold (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily offering of 1200 mg of amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The 21 underlying mechanism for the genesis of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been elucidated and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, from the present exposure data to the human being, both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application, there was little evidence for the adoption of clinical relevance of these findings.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of In-vivo- and In-vitro-Genotoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse lymphoma test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations at human peripheral lymphocytes, Amdetavir was neither mutagen nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical practice by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Up to now, no significant liver toxicity in patients was observed in clinical trials, neither during the administration of Agenerase nor after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in juveniles, which were treated at an age of 4 days, showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amponavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">With systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed which indicate a delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the reinforcing addition of kritonavir (boosting), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) need to be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amponavir / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a day-maximum dose of 2400 mg amonavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use is to be carried out with caution in patients with weak or slight liver dysfunction, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2066">26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under the supervision of the International Normalised Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="2067">Agenerase should be set to 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="2071">The Cmin values of amponavir in plasma which were achieved twice daily with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg kritonavir twice daily) are approximately 40 to 50% lower than if Amdetavir (600 mg twice daily) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2072">A dosage recommendation for simultaneous administration of amponavir and Kaletra can not be given, however, a close-meshed monitoring is recommended, as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amponavir and saquinavir is not recommended as exposure of both protease inhibitors would be low.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these drugs are used together, caution is advisable; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amponavir and kritonavir on Delavirdin is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2075">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer Rifabutin together with Agenerase, reduction of the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is 31, although there are no clinical data available for this.</seg>

<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase an increased control of the INR (International standard ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the anti-thrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of Ortho-Novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg of Norethindron) led to a decrease in AUC and Cmin from Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>
<seg id="2080">During pregnancy, this drug may only be used after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2081">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given by the nesting in the uterus to the end of breastfeeding, showed a diminished increase in body weight during lactation during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2082">The harmlessness of asgenerase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2083">In the event of overdose, the patient must observe signs of an intoxication (see Section 4.8), if necessary, to initiate necessary supportive measures.</seg>
<seg id="2084">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro against HIV-1 IIIB was investigated both in acute and chronic lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) as well as peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2085">The 50% Hemmkonzentration (IC50) of Amprenavir is in the range from 0.012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.41 µM in chronically infected cells (1 µM = 0.50 µg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2086">Contrariwise, Amprenavir reserves its activity against some other proteastical-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2087">Based on this data, the expected benefits of "unborn" agroase should be taken into account in the treatment optimisation of children treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2088">While absolute concentration of unbound Amdetavir remains constant, the percentage of the free active component fluctuates during the dosage interval depending on the total-drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to Cmin, ss.</seg>

<seg id="2099">The bioavailability of amponavir as a solution for intake is 14% less than from Amprenavir as capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution are not exchangeable on a milligram per milligram basis (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2100">Patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are in a position to stop taking the solution (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2101">The recommended dose for Agenerase solution is 17 mg (1.1 ml) Amdetavir / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a maximum dose of 2800 mg amponavir which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2102">In addition, since no dose recommendation for the simultaneous use of Agenerase solution for taking and low dose kritonavir can be given, this combination can be avoided in these groups of patients.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Although a dose adaptation is not considered necessary for Amprenavir, an application of Agenerase is contraindicated for taking in patients with kidney failure (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2104">Due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propyl alcohol content, Agroase is contraindicated for the inclusion of small children and children under 4 years, in pregnant women, in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2105">Simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive inhibition of the metabolism of these medicines and may cause serious and / or life-threatening side effects such as cardiac arrhythmias (z).</seg>

<seg id="2196">Local skin reactions are common, but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions after the treatment with Imiquimod cream are returned.</seg>
<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the patient's discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break can be made of several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Since there are currently no data on long-term recovery rates of more than 36 months after the treatment, other appropriate forms of therapy should be considered in superficial basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">There are no clinical experience in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, therefore the application is not recommended for pre-treated tumours.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tumours (&gt; 7.25 cm2) there is a lower probability of response to the Imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not studied for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip.</seg>
<seg id="2203">There are only very limited data about the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical spots outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratosis on the forearms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this purpose, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions often occur, but these reactions usually take place in the course of the therapy of intensity or go back after settling the therapy with Imiquimod cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause large discomfort to the patient or are very strong, treatment may be suspended for a few days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">From the data of an open clinical study, patients with more than 8 lesions showed a lower overall rate of healing than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immunostimulatory properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with care in patients receiving immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although there is no quantifiable level of serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) after one or more topical application, no recommendation can be given to the application during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most frequently involved and possibly or possibly with the application of Imiquimodine cream related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most commonly reported and possibly or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod cream in the related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The basalioma patients treated with Imiquimod cream from a placebo-controlled clinical trial of Phase III reported side effects are shown below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In these studies the most common, as likely or possibly with the application of the Imiquimod-cream in the context-related side effect, were a reaction to the application location (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">Adverse events reported by 252 in placebo-controlled Phase III clinical trials with Imiquimod Cream were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The clinical evidence assessed according to the study plan shows that in these placebo-controlled clinical trials of three times weekly treatment with Imiquimod cream frequently on local skin reactions including erythema (61%), excreation / draining / draining (23%) and edema (14%) came (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the study plan, the evaluation of clinical evidence shows that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with imiquimodine cream very often resulted in severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%), and serious scarring and cemolation (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical studies investigating the application of imiquimod for the treatment of actinic keratosis, alopecia was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) at the treatment point or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The inadvertent oral absorption of 200 mg Imiquimod, which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect, which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg, consisted of hypotonia, normalized according to oral or intravenous fluid.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In pharmacokinetic investigation, systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines were detected after the topical application of ismiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that the efficacy in relation to complete curing of the hands during an imiquimod treatment is clearly superior for 16 weeks of placebo treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2223">At 60% of the total of 119 patients who were treated with Imiquimod, the remaining warts were completely absent; this was the case with 20% of the 105 patients who were treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved in 23% of 157 patients treated with imiquimod, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five-time application per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary superficial basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The data presented in an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years showed that about 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this remained for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment-free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non hypertrophic acts within a cohesive 25 cm2 area of treatment on the hairy scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The one-year data from two combined observation studies show a recurrence rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The approved indications of external susceptibility, actinic keratosis and superficial basal cell carcinoma do not usually occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara Cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled trials of children aged 2 to 15 with Molluscum contagiosum (Imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">In these studies the efficacy of imiquimod could not be shown in these studies (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively).</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of the 5% Imiquimod cream through the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratosis was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest concentrations of the drug in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12,5 mg, 1 disposable bag), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated half-life expectancy was about 10 times higher than the 2-hour half-life after the subcutaneous use in a previous study; this indicates an extended retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The data for systemic exposure showed that the resorption of imiquimod after topical application to MC-diseased skin was low from 6 to 12 years and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratosis or superficial basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity at rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study conducted for four months for the dermal application showed no similar effects for the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of the carcinogenicity of mice in mice on three days a week did not induce tumours at the application site.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The mechanism is not known, but since Imiquimod only has a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagenic, it is a risk for humans to be regarded as very low because of systemic exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Tumours occurred in the group of mice treated with the active ingredient-free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with low UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for the enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) are not degraded and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following non neurological symptoms of MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, complicating movements, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with rehabilitation equipment, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study was focused mainly on the safety of the drug but it was also measured by its effectiveness (by investigating its effect in the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in terms of the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five, Aldurazyme lowered the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headaches, nausea, abdominal pain, skin rash, arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, pain in limbs (in hands and feet), heat sensation, fever and reactions at the infusion point.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are elevated blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may be strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reaction).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all the new information that may be known each year and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued a permit for the issuance of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union to the Genzyme Europe B.V..</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammal cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, ovary of the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">Treatment with Aldurazyme should be carried out by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other hereditary metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule is recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver insufficiency has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme may develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effect related to infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where recharging facilities are immediately available for medical emergencies.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against larvonidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of infusion-related reaction must be treated with caution when using aldurazyms (see Sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">Since there is little experience in the recovery of the treatment after a longer interruption, due to the theoretically elevated risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be performed cautiously.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before beginning infusion with medication (antihistamines and / or antipyretics) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of a slight or moderate infusion-related reaction, the treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be weighed and / or reduction of the infusion rate to half the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In case of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion needs to be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, a treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">Infusion can be resumed with a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3 (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in the infusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain because there is a potential risk of interference with the intracellular uptake of laronidase.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since there are no data on newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as infusion-related reactions which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (treatment duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (treatment duration up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Undesirable drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their prolongation with a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older, are listed in the following table according to the following frequency: very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of upper respiratory tract and lungs in the prehistory, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing lock and facial oils (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug interactions in connection with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5, with predominantly severe course of course and a treatment duration up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients, a seroconversion occurred within 3 months of the treatment, with a more severe form of serotonin at the age of 5 (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature withdrawal from the study), 13 / 45 patients had no evidence of radioimmunopsy (RIP) assay, including 3 patients, which had never occurred to seroconversion.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with lack of low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG mirror in the urine, whereas in patients with high antibody filters a variable reduction of GAG was detected in the urine.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on the enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro, which seemed to impair clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of adverse drug reactions, even though the occurrence of adverse drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enzyme replacement therapy is one of the hydrolysis of the accumulated substrate and the prevention of further accumulation of adequate restore of enzyme activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from circulation and absorbed by cells in the lysosomes, most likely via manose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study showing the entire disease spectrum, the majority of patients were of the middle phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FEV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FEV and the absolute distance in the 6-minute walk.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study, where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme each week for another 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed an improvement in lung function and ability to improve lung function in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Aldurazyme group as seen from the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FEV is clinically not significant over this period and the absolute pulmonary volumes increased further proportionately to the height of children growing.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly before treatment 22 (85%) had a normal liver size until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks a clear drop in the GAG mirror in the urine (µg / mg of Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease-manifestations between the patients, which were taken into account by using a combined end point, the clinically significant changes across five effectiveness variables (expected percentage normal FEV, range of shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), was generally an improvement in 26 patients (58%), no change in 10 patients (22%) and a worsening in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years of age (16 patients with a severe form of expiration and 4 with the mean flow form).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in Harn in Week 22.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) found a normal mental development speed according to the Z-Score for this age group (&lt; 2.5 years) and all 4 patients with mid-course form had a normal mental development speed, whereas in the older patients with severe course of course only limited or no progress in cognitive development had been observed.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase 4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various aldurazyme dosing regimens were performed on the GAG mirror in the urine, liver volume and the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenously once a week (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenously once a week, 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks may represent an acceptable alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2334">The pharmacokinetic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that in older and less severely affected patients.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another drug against cancer) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (drugs against cancer) and "malignant" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body), advanced or metastatic "non-small" lung cancer, which does not attack the squamous epithelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Alimta is used as sole therapy for patients who have not been treated before, in combination with cisplatin and in patients who previously received other chemotherapies.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should use a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, a "antiemetic medication" (medicines for vomiting) and liquids must be given before or after cisplatin (to prevent a lack of fluid).</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood cell changes or where certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, lowered or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetrexed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from splitting.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The conversion of Pemetrexed into its active form is easier to equip in cancer cells than in healthy cells resulting in higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer period of activity in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural pregnancy, Alimta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for their disease.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy, compared with the effects of docetaxel (another drug against cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another drug against cancer), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1 725 patients who had previously received no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with Alimta and cisplatin survived an average of 12.1 months, compared to 9.3 months with the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time with Alimta was 8.3 months, compared to 7.9 months in docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients in which the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells, in the administration of Alimta, showed longer survival times than with the comparison medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Alimta in the entire European Union to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V..</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each piercing bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml), resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the water bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride-injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for primary epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for treatment in second-line treatment of patients with Lo- kal advanced or metastatic non-small cell carcinoma except for overwiev-epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² of body surface (KOF) administered intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as an infusion about a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the emetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small bronchial cell carcinoma after previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as an intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">The frequency and severity of skin reactions must be given the day before and on the day of the emetrexed administration as well as a corticosteroid on the day after treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days prior to the first dose of emetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days after the last emetrexed dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients also need to receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 micrograms) in the week prior to the first pemetrexed dose as well as after every third treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetrexed, a complete blood sample should be created before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and thrombocyte counters.</seg>
<seg id="2379">The alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and alanine-transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">At the beginning of a new treatment cycle, a dose examination must take place under consideration of the Nadir of the blood sample or the maximum non-haematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must continue to be treated according to the indications in tables 1, 2 and 3, which apply to ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC grade 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ grade 3 (excluding neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">The treatment with ALIMTA must be aborted if there is an hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity of 3 or 4 neurotoxicity in patients after 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or above, compared to patients aged 65 years of age, there is an increased side effect.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Kreatinin-Clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min, which go beyond the dosage adjustment recommended for all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data layer in patients with a creatine clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a reduced liver function of &gt; the 1.5-fold upper bilirubin limit value and / or transaminase value of &gt; the 3.0 times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0 times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) was not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients must be monitored in terms of bone marosuppression and Pemetrexed must not be given to patients before their absolute neutrophal count regains a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has again reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">A dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute neutrophils, thrombocytes and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in previous courses of treatment (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction in degree 3 / 4 haematological and non-matological toxicity such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with Grade 3 / 4 neutropenia was observed when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore all patients treated with emetrexed need to be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure for the reduction of treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (Kreatinin-Clearance 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid concurrent consumption of nonsteroidal anti-phthalisk (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients eligible for therapy with emetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with long half-life for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting hypertension or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Therefore, a drainage of the effusion in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space is to be weighed before the emetrexed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 primary cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events, were occasionally reported in clinical trials with emetrexed when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic agent.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous use of attenuated live vaccines (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive ability is made by emetrexed, men should be advised in front of the treatment course to obtain advice regarding sperm preservation.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of non-steroidal anti-phthalistics (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g a day) lead to a reduced pemetrexed excretion with the consequence of increased incidence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">It is therefore advisable to use high doses of NSAIDs or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen or acetylsalicylic acid in high doses for at least 2 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emetrexed (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since there are no data regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous use with emetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days prior to therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with emetrexed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The large intra-individual variability of the coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Normalised ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of emetrexed in pregnant women, but as with ande- ren antimetabolites, severe birth defects are expected during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Emetrexed must not be used during pregnancy, except when necessarily - demanding and after careful weighing of the benefit for the mother and the risk for the fetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive ability is made by emetrexed, men should be advised before the treatment begins to obtain advice regarding the blocking of the sperm.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetrexed passes into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomized cisplatin and pemetrexed, and 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Side effects Frequency declarations: very common (≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000), very rare (&lt; 1 / 10,000) and not known (not invaluable based on the available data of spontaneous reports).</seg>

<seg id="2427">Clinical studies occasionally reported cases of colitis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal, intestinal perfo- ration, intestinal necrosis and typhlitis).</seg>
<seg id="2428">In clinical trials, patients with emetrexed treatment have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal interstitial Pneumonitis with respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It was reported on cases of acute renal failure in pemetrexed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy drugs (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were beamed before, during or after their emetrexed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetrexed) is an antineoplastic antifolate that performs its effect by interrupting important metabolic processes that are necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that Pemetrexed acts as an antifolate with multiple targets by blocking the thyme dye synthase (TS), Dihydrofolate reductase (GARFT), the folate-dependent key enzymes of the de novo Biosynthesis of Thymidine and Purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicentre, randomized, easy-blind phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin against cisplatin in chemonaiven patients with malignant pleural othelioma showed that with ALIMTA and cisplatin treated patients had a clinically important advantage of a median 2.8-month survival compared to those patients who were only treated with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients who received investigational medication in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) related to the malignant pleural othelioma was shown in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm (212 patients) compared with the sole Cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two treatment arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / cisplatin arm and a deterioration of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicentre, randomised, open phase III study with ALIMTA against docetaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC achieved median survival time of 8.3 months with ALIMTA treated patients (intent to treat population n = 283) and 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>

<seg id="2506">In a third study, Alli was compared to 391 overweight patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who took Alli 60 mg had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after a year, compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study with Alli in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no significant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients) are oily spots at the anus, flatus (winds) with stupework, stucldiness, oily / oily chair, finish oily secretion (rot), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in transplant patients) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>

<seg id="2513">Alli is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli must not be used by children and adolescents under 18, since there is insufficient data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">Since Orlistat is only minimally resorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for the elderly and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">• Oversensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simultaneous treatment with Ciclosporin (see section 4.6) • Chronic treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see Sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or a fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Since weight reduction can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli because the dosage of antidiabetic needs to be adjusted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who take alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist if the dosage of these drugs must be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional contraceptive measures to prevent the oral contraception possible in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">A reduction of the Ciclosporin plasma is observed in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and Ciclosporin.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the Quick-values (internationally standardized ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical trials up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K as well as the beta-carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be recommended to take a supplementary multivitamin supplement before bedtime to ensure adequate vitamine intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">After the administration of a single dose of Amiodarone, a marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the drug, as the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">The gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies with orlistat 60 mg over a duration of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">Frequencies are defined as follows: very often (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 1000), rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000), not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The frequency of known side effects found after the launch of orlistat is not known since these events have been voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered in normal and overweight subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The majority of cases reported after the release of orlistat overdose were either reported to have no side effects or similar side effects as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on studies on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by the floating properties of orlistat can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect begins in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine by covalent bonding to the active Serin-Rest of the gastrian and pankreatic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Clinical studies suggest that 60 mg orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of approximately 25% of the food fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies of adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 confirm the efficacy of 60 mg orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypocaloric, low-fat diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (Table 1) and as a percentage of those who have lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although the weight reduction was observed in both studies for 12 months, the greatest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The average change in the Gesamtcholesterin was with orlistat 60 mg -2.4% (initial value 5.4 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (initial value 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was with orlistat 60 mg -3.5% (initial value 3.30 mmol / l) and with placebo + 3.8% (initial value 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">The waist circumference was 4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103,7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in the plasma was only sporadic and at extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without signs of cumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">In a study involving obese patients with minimal systemic resorbated dose, two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed Lactonring) and M3 (M1 after separation of the N-form leucine group) could be identified, representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>

<seg id="2608">Aloxi is used in chemotherapies that are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting (such as cisplatin), as well as in chemotherapies, which are moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting (like cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin or carboplatin).</seg>
<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding an additional gift of a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemetic medicine).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The application for patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active ingredient prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5-hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the gut.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was studied in three main studies of 1 842 adults who received chemotherapy, which are strong or moderate triggers for nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (132 from 223) in 24 hours after chemotherapy, compared to 57% of patients treated with ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, the moderate trigger for nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting (153 of 189) in 24 hours after chemotherapy, compared to 69% of patients treated with ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with Dolasetron these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">March 2005 the European Commission issued approval for the transport of Aloxi in the entire European Union to the company of Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indicated: for the prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in highly emetogenic chemotherapy, due to a cancer illness and for the prevention of nausea and vomiting in case of chemotherapy, due to a cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The efficacy of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given prior to chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since palonosetron can prolong the colon sage, patients with anamnesty obstipation or signs of a subacute Ileus should be closely monitored after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">However, as with other 5HT3 antagonists, caution is advisable with simultaneous administration of palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the QT interval is prolonged or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to a further chemotherapy dose, Aloxi is not to be used in the days after chemotherapy to prevent nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies palonosetron did not block the activity of the five studied chemotherapeutics (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, doxorubicin, and mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">A clinical study showed no significant pharmacokinetic interactions between a single intravenous dose of palonosetron and a Steady State- Concentration of oral metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and Rifampicin) and CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Doxorubicin, fluoxetine, haloperidol, paroxetine, sertraline and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the cleavage of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Experience for the use of palonosetron in human pregnancies is not present, so Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is deemed necessary by the treating physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">Clinical trials were the most common side effects observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients), which were at least possibly associated with Aloxi, headaches (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the location (burning, curing, discomfort and pain) were given in post-marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">In the group with the highest dosage there were similar frequencies of adverse events as in the other dosage groups; there were no dose-effective relationships observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume, however, dialysis is probably not effective therapy in an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, a total of 1,132 patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclophosphamide and &gt; 25 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 Doxorubicin and 100 mg of Dolasetron (half-life time 7.3 hours) were given, which was given intravenously on day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomized double-blind study, 667 patients who received a highly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2Cisplatin, &gt; 1,500 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms of palonosetron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of the studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study of highly emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical trials for indication chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters, including the Qtc interval, were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and Dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ionic channels involved in ventricular de- and repolarisation and extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study conducted at 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the ECG effects of intravenous palonosetron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption after IV administration follows an initial decrease of the plasma concentrations a slow elimination of the body with an average terminal half-time of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration-time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose-proportionally in the entire dose range of 0.- 90 μ g / kg for healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">Following intravenous dosage of palonosetron 0.25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the average (± SD) increase in palonosetron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34% was measured between day 1 and day 5.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Out of pharmacokinetic simulations, the overall composition (AUC0- ∞) of 0.25 mg palonosetron, measured at once daily intravenous dose of 0.75 mg, was comparable; however, the Cmax was 0.75 mg higher after one-time injection of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated by the kidneys and another 50% are converted into two primary metabolites, which in comparison to Palonosetron have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies for metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, in a lesser degree, are involved in the Isoenzyme CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 on the metabolism of palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">After an intravenous dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as unaltered substance made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous injection in healthy patients, the total body was 173 ± 73 ml / min and renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Admittedly, in patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with palonosetron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified by this.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In pre-clinical studies effects were observed only after expositions which are considered sufficient over the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 Out of preclinical studies evidence that palonosetron can only block ionic channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and repolarization and can prolong the term of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosetron (each dose corresponded to approximately the 30fold of the therapeutic exposure in humans), which were given daily over two years, led to an increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid gland, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumours in rats, but not in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is determined in humans for a unique application, the relevance of these results is very small.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative opinion in which the approval of the approval for the transport of the medicine designated for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injections.</seg>
<seg id="2661">"" "this means that Alpheon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same drug which has already been approved in the EU (also called" "" "reference medicinal products" "" ")." ""</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (liver disease caused by viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In the case of a microscopic examination the liver tissue detects damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanin Amino sferase (ALT) are heightened in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) is introduced, which stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The Alpheon manufacturer presented data demonstrating the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was stopped (i.e. no signs of the virus reported in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 00 Fax (44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int © EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non-commercial purposes only provided the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were expressed in such a way that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed cannot be sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After setting the treatment with Alpheon, the disease flared up in more patients than with the reference drug; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">Apart from that, the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the drug forms an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine), is not sufficiently validated.</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used to treat Impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected inlaerations (tears or cuts), abrasions and sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections caused by methicillinant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) because Alarcon may not work against this type of infection.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface to be treated may not exceed 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thereby inhibits the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was scled at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients suffering from Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients in placebo spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin dogs, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: if the results of both studies were taken together with skin dogs, about 90% of both groups spoke to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (eitermed cavities in the body tissue) or of infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most frequent side effect with Altargo (which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is an irritation at the placing of the order.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo prevail in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmaries, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the transport of Altargo across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined again and consider alternative therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the event of sensitization or serious local irritation by applying retinapamulin ointment, the treatment is aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection has begun.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin is not to be used to treat infections where MRSA is known or suspected as a pathogen (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical trials of secondary uninfected open wounds the efficacy of retinapoulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2 to 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of simultaneous use of retinapamine and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been examined and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">A clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application of skin or infected superficial wounds (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral dosage of 2 times a day 200 mg ketoconazole, the mean reapamulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% retapamulin ointment on weakened skin of healthy adult men increased by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not required when topical retinapulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in relation to a statement regarding the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinapamulin is preferable to the application of systemic antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the therapy with Altargo should be continued / terminated, the benefit of breastfeeding is to be weighed for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that have applied Altargo was the most commonly reported side effect irritation at the location, which was about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of leuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus Passeckeranus (formerly pleurotus passeckerianus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The active mechanism of retinapamulin is based on the selective inhibiting of the bacterial protein synthesis through interaction with a specific binding site of the 50s subunit of the bacterial ribosome, which differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicates that the binding site of ribosomal protein L3 is involved and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptide transfer centre.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, pleuromutiline inhibits peptide transfer, blocking parts of P-binding interactions and preventing the normal formation of active 50-bosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If due to the local prevalence of resistance the application of Retapamulin at least some infection forms seem questionable, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in vitro activity of retinapamulin versus S.aureus, regardless of whether the Isolate were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In case of non-responding to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of trunks with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults 1% retapamulin Salbe was applied daily under occlusion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">From 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 in adult patients before the treatment and in children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, the maximum individual systemic uptake of people after topical application of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 shredded skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsomes was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies on oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid gland changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro review of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymphoma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat microkernel test for in-vivo investigation of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There was neither male nor female rats showing signs of restricted fertility for oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, which has achieved an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2)</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study on rats, for oral dosages ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed oscillation) and maternal toxicity were detected.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The holder of the licensing agreement must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the module 1.8.1 of the authorisation application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product is marketed.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The holder of the licensing agreement commits itself to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vigilance activities in the Pharmacovigilance plan, as described in Version 1 of Risk Management Plan (RMP), as well as all additional updates of the RMP, which are agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use, the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated area show you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other intments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not prescribed by your doctor specifically.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It may not be applied in the eyes, on the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment is based on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if symptoms occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment you can cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambirix is used as part of a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose is desirable against hepatitis A or B, Ambirix or another hepatitis A or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">Vaccines work by contributing to the immune system (the body's natural defences) as it can defend itself against a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognizes the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "foreign" "" "and generates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ambirix includes the same components as the vaccines approved since 1996 and the vaccination of Twinrix children since 1997.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same illnesses, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered as part of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data supporting the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month gap between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">At between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambirix led a month after the last injection to develop protective antibody concentrations for hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambirix was similar to a six-month and a 12-month distance between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambirix (observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection site, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambirix may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">August 2002 the European Commission issued a permit to GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals s.a. a permit for the transport of Ambirix in the whole</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standardization plan for primers with Ambirix consists of two vaccines, whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose ranges from six to twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is desired both for Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B, the corresponding monovalent vaccines or combination vaccine may be vaccinated.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis C surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and Anti-Hepatitis A Virus (anti-HBV) antibodies observed after a basic dimming with the combination vaccine are in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured whether immunocompetent persons who have addressed a Hepatitis A- vaccination need a booster as protection, since they may also be protected with immunological memory even in cases of non-detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the application of the vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardization scheme with the combination vaccine is recommended that contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactive hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In the case of hemodialysis patients and people with disruptions of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody value can be reached after basal dimming, so that in these cases the application of additional vaccines can be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intra-male injection or intramuscular administration could lead to a suboptimal impunity in the gluteal muscles, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">However, in the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clotting disorders, Ambirix can be injected subcutaneous as it can occur in these cases after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">When Ambirix in the second year of life was administered in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheriea, tetanus, acellular pertin, inactivated poliomyelitis- and Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it is necessary to assume that there is possibly no adequate immune response.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 vaccines of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headache, and fever were comparable to the frequency observed in previous thiomersal- and preservatives-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 Vaccine Ambirix vaccine was administered to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to 15 years, Ambirix tolerability was compared to that of the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">Only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a basis of calculation per vaccination dose Ambirix, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed after the dose of Ambirix at 50.7% of the subjects, compared to 39.1% in the test persons after the dose of a 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">According to the complete vaccination cycle, 66,4% of the volunteers who received Ambirix had pain, compared to 63.8% in the test subjects, who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">The frequency of matches, however, was comparable high (i.e. over the total vaccination cycle of 39.6% of the volunteers who received Ambirix compared to 36.2% in the subjects receiving the 3-dose combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of severe pain and sensitivity was low and comparable to those observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11 year old vaccines, the incidence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambirixgroup was comparable to the hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen with 360 ELISA units.</seg>
<seg id="2759">In the 6- to 11-year-old, however, after vaccination with Ambirix a more frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection site) per dose, not per proband, was reported.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccinations that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccine with Ambirix or during the 3-dose vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactive hepatitis C virus and 10 µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen, was statistically not different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted for vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years, the seroconversion rates for anti-HAV 99,1% were one month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">The seroconversion rates for anti-HBs were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study conducted at 12- to including 15-year-olds, 142 two doses of Ambirix and 147 were awarded the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 people whose immunogenicity was worthless, the seroprotection rates (SP in the table below) were significantly higher versus hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the dose of 3-dose vaccine higher than with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses, which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11-year-olds one month after completion of the full vaccination series (i.e. in month 7), are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In both studies, the vaccinations received either a 2-doses vaccination scheme with Ambirix or a 3-dose vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactive hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant Hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after immunization with Ambirix in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme for persons who were between 12 and 15 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immunreaction observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to the hepatitis B surface antigen-activated Hepatitis- A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study of 12- to including 15-year-olds, the persistence of anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibodies could be compared 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months vaccination scheme is compared to the 0-12-month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2770">If the first dose of Ambirix in the second year of life was given simultaneously with the booster shot of a combined diphtheriea, tetanus, acellular pertussis-, inactivated poliomyelitis- and 8 Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, the immune response was sufficient for all antigens.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not completely protect from infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B viruses, even if the complete vaccination series has been completed with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A- or Hepatitis B viruses before administration of both vaccines (although you / your child may not feel unwell or ill at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that cause damage to the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>

<seg id="2785">At a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination, the doctor will advise you / your child from vaccination with Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per vaccination dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactive hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of recombinant hepatitis B surface treatment).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second vaccination dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccination protection before termination of the vaccination series.</seg>

<seg id="2804">Ambirix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without needles and in packs of 50 without needles.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Based on the data, which have become known since the first approval for the placing of the market, the CHMP believes that the benefit-risk ratio for Ambirix remains positive.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since Ambirix was only transported in a Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this medicine was limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients at the age of over a month with incomplete enzyme defect or with hyperammonia-mic encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in the prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">Ammonites - split into several individual doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under food or administered via a Gastroomieschlauch (through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading tube).</seg>

<seg id="2811">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that ammonia in patients with disturbances in the urea cycle could effectively prevent high ammonia levels.</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "Ammonites was approved under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "since only limited information on this medicine was available due to the rarity of the disease at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients where a complete enzyme deficiency already manifests in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late-manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first month of life), an indication for use occurs when a hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For babies, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually considering the protein tolerance and the daily intake of the patient's daily protein intake.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornighintranscarcity.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatal deficiency must receive arginine in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15,4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders as there is a risk for the genesis of esophagusulcera if the tablets do not immediately enter the stomach.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">AMMONAPS should therefore be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency, as well as with sodium retention and odemformation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate occurs over the liver and kidneys, AMMONAPS should only be used with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; therefore, the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">At subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown in neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a diminished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted by humans into breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS during lactation is contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS, at 56% of patients had at least one unwanted event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very frequently (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactattoo, severe hypothalmia, bullet topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdose occurred during a 5 month old infant with an inadvertent single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms start with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous dose of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolic active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of biased sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is set early and the treatment is started immediately in order to improve the survival chances and the clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infected, and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By hemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of nitrogen removal (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenyl acetate), protein-reduced diet and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first month of life) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and which were treated before the first occurrence of a hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late-manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygotic form of the Orniethintranscarbamylase deficiency), which were treated by a hyperdomesian encephalopathy and then treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrate and a proteinated diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible in the treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylacetate is known to oxidise phenylacetate into phenylacetate, which is conjugated with glutamine in the liver and kidneys, with phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentration of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in an empty healthy adult and in patients suffering from disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis after single assignment as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (uncontrolled trials).</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behavior of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites was also studied in cancer patients after IV administration of sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were found 15 minutes after the intake.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urinary disorders or hemoglobin opathies, phenylbutyrat (300-650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day) could not be detected in plasma the next morning after fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the middle phenylacetate concentrations in the plasma crucible were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">Excretion The medication is excreted over the kidneys within 24 hours to about 80 - 100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the Micronucleus tests, sodium phenylbutyrat with toxic and non-toxic doses had no clear effects (examination 24 and 48 h after oral dosing of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken orally (infants and children who are not able to swallow any tablets or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a Gastroomieschlauch or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight of over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins in the plasma should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or ornighintranscarcity.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5.4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g. of sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">When rats were exposed before the birth of phenylacetate (active metabolism of phenylbutyrat), lesions occurred in the pyramids of the brain cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic encephalopathy in combination with lactattoo, severe hypothalmia, bullet topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitric atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of investigations on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram of biased sodium phenylbutysupply can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in granular form, plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were found 15 minutes after the ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the duration of the shelf life, the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon contains 0.95 g, the medium measuring spoon of 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine via a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they can not excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after the consumption of proteins.</seg>
<seg id="2865">If laboratory tests are carried out, you must inform the doctor that you are taking AMMONAPS because sodium phenylbutyrate may influence the results of certain laboratory tests.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with "acute coronary arsyndromes" (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example with instable angina (a form of pain in the thorax with different strength) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "lifting" (abnormal measured value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can contribute to the maintenance of blood flow in patients with angina or heart attack and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox was compared with a single dose or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) with conventional combination treatment with Heparin (another anti-agulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI the patient was often a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent a closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots like Abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS was angiox - with or without a gift of GPI - in the prevention of new events (deaths, heart attacks or revascularisation) after 30 days or a year overall as effective as conventional treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients who underwent one PCI, Angiox was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was much more effective than Heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalent studies, other millet or any other component.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It may also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as in people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or a heart infection.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that angiox is an acceptable substitute for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve the transport of angioxes across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary arsyndromes (unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI)) in case of emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous injection of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If one PCI is performed in a further episode, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to clinical requirements, the reduced infusion dosage of 0.25 mg / kg / h can be taken for 4 to 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2894">Immediately prior to the procedure, an injection of 0.5 mg / kg should be given, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial I.V. injection of 0.75 mg / kg of body weight and an intravenous intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single Bolus gift from Angiox was not investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values, the reconstituent and diluted medication should be carefully mixed before use and the injection dose should be quickly administered intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">As soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dosage is given correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min) which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivalent studies against ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT-value is less than 225 seconds, it is possible to administer a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg and to reconsider the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, which were included in the III- PCI study (REPLACE-2) which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after the use of the Bivalirudin-Bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 For patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and also in dialysis patients angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">Treatment with angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intravenous dose of non-fractionated heparin or 8 hours after the subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• well-known hypersensitivity to the active substance or any other component or against deer. • severe uncontrolled hypertension and / or irreversible clotting disorders. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and dialysis-based patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially when bivalent studies are administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even though most bleedings on arterial points occur in the case of PCI-patients under bivalent studies, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur throughout the treatment in principle.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who take Warfarin and be treated with Bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Normalised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after replacing the treatment with bivalent studies is again achieved prior to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Based on the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocytes), it can be assumed that these substances increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological hemostaseparameters are to be checked regularly in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2911">The experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, childbirth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to Bivalirudin alone, 4604 were randomised to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomised to either unquestionable heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalent studies group as well as in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, patients and patients over 65 were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding was defined according to ACUITY and Timi standards for severe bleeding, as in Table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both mild and severe bleedings were significantly less frequent than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and Bivalidrudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperitoneal, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage in the point of puncture, diminution of haemoglobin mirror ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known bleeding point, Reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Further, less frequently observed bleeding localizations, which occurred at more than 0.1% (occasionally), were "other" punctuation points, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose or neck.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical study with bivalent studies of 6,000 patients who underwent one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the Bivalirudin group as well as in the comparison groups treated with Heparin, patients and patients over 65 were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both mild and severe bleeding were significantly less frequent than in the comparison group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects which are not listed above have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped in table 6 according to system organ classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the event of overdosing, the treatment with bivalent studies must be stopped immediately and the patient can monitor closely meshed with regard to the signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalent studies, a direct and specific thrombininhibitor, which binds to the catalytic center as well as in the ion-binding region of thrombin, regardless of whether thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">Binding of Bivalirudin to thrombin, and hence its effect, is reversible, because Thrombin slowly splits the bond of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, bivalirudin with serum from patients with serum induced thrombocytopenia / heparininduced thrombocytopenia (HIT / HITTS) could not induce platelet aggregation reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy subjects and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulatory effect, which is proven by the extension of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If one PCI was performed in the following patients, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalent studies should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In the arm A of the ACUITY study, non-fractionated Heparin or Enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable angina / non-ST uplift infarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in arm A and B were also randomised to obtain a GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor either before starting angiography (at the time of randomization) or in the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high risk patients who required angiography within 72 hours were equally distributed over the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Approximately 77% of patients had recurring ischemia, 70% had dynamic ECG changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients underwent an angiography within 72 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2932">The primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30-day and 1 year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for the patients who received aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following events: intracranial, retroperito neale, intraocular bleeding or hemorrhage in the point area, reduction of haemoglobin level of ≥ 3 g / dl with well-known hemorrhage, reoperation due to bleeding, use of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple outcomes of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients undergoing one PCI (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical studies with a small number of patients provided limited information on the application of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic properties of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as well as in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that bivalirudin as a peptide is going through a catabolism in its amino acid constituents with subsequent redevaluation of the amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabaster resulting from splitting the ARG3 Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence through thrombin is not effective due to the loss of its affinity to the catalytic centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Elimination is performed in patients with normal kidney function following a first order process with a terminale half-time of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes who require treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is administered subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to control glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or cannot process insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin-lulisin differs very slightly from human insulin, and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter duration of activity than a short-term human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra has been studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, where the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">In the case of type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot effectively work insulin, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of the efficacy was to change the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed after six months compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin leaps.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin lulisin or any of the other ingredients, or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may need to be adapted when administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit for the transport of Apidra in the entire European Union to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH.</seg>
<seg id="2977">As subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, thigh or delta muscle or to apply subcutaneous through continuous infusion in the area of the abdomen.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Due to reduced gluconogenesis capacity and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin delivery can be reduced in patients with a reduction in liver function.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of active force, brand (producer), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-delayed etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can change the insulin requirement.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of a treatment, especially in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis; these conditions potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">The conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin from another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and may require a change in the dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the activity profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is converted.</seg>
<seg id="2983">Substances which increase blood sugar-lowering activity and increase the tendency to hypoglycemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, discopyramid, fibrin, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifyllin, propoxyphene, salamylates and sulfonamide antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, under the effect of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, Clonidine, Guanethidin and reserpine, the symptoms of adrenergic counterregulation can be weakened or absent.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin regarding pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin lulisin occurs in human breast milk, but in general insulin does not enter breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">The following are the clinical trials known from clinical studies, grouped according to system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very often: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; rare: ≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10.000; not known (frequency on the basis of available data is not invaluable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, fatigue, nervousness or tremor, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive dog, headache, nausea and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy Is neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area, as a result of a lipodystrophy at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemia with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a suitably trained person, or intravenous dose of glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of the serious hypoglycaemia and avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating peripheral glucose absorption (especially skeletal muscles and fat) as well as the inhibition of glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration of operation is shorter than in case of hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study involving 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes melli- tus, insulin lucsin in the therapeutic-relevant dosing range from 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg showed a dose of proportional glucosal effect, and at 0.3 E / kg or more a disproportionate increase in the glucose-giving effect, just like human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin-lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect around 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post-denoeal glycaemic control is achieved such as with human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was depleted 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-denodenal control was achieved than with a human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin lulisin is applied 15 minutes after the meal begins, a comparable glycaemic control is achieved, such as in human normal insulin, which is given 2 months before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin-lulisin given 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the beginning of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min.) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1A) and compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin-lulisin by offering 15 minutes (GLULISIN - after) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor- malinsulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the beginning of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
