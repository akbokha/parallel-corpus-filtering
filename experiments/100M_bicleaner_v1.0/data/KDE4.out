the package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ;
to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions .... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want .
this is a list of standard installation modules from the box k@@ de ; add@@ ons . please note that any more modules on your system are installed , if you have additional software installed .
you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package .
to use the crash module , click in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools cras@@ hes . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available , delete .
the module View Fil@@ ters ( also called Fol@@ der Fil@@ ters ) can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or menu . the module allows you to filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
to view the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , select Tools DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the page displayed . as default , the display begins with the root node of the document , for example : docum@@ enta element , all other nodes are sub @-@ elements of this root node .
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides another view for objects with the MI@@ ME @-@ Type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of ne@@ sting ne@@ sted order hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called tree map . tree @-@ Maps indicate the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
with &amp; FS@@ View , the size is the size of a file or folder , with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can easily be recognized even if it is located far below in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered .
in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap display is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rect@@ angles have meaningful color and labelling settings .
the color of a rect@@ angle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the ne@@ sting depth or the picture of another file property , such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type .
a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the respective file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation ( and therefore display errors may occur due to restrictions in the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap ) . moreover , you can set the relative position of the label in the rect@@ angle .
for Tre@@ em@@ ap &apos;s presentation algorithms , the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this target is not always comp@@ lied with . it is drawn boxes to indicate the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame will need space , which is then lost to the subordin@@ ate entries .
as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left , the implementation is left up . here it is necessary to divide the areas so that rect@@ angles are created that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are rows , columns or recur@@ sive branches .
you can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu item View Per@@ taining on Area . instead , a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent input to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry .
originally &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get designed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind .
the module image gallery can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Image Gallery ... or by C@@ trl ; I .

&amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that means the user and developer can help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam ; then we would like to ask you questions about other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage visit to learn more about released versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ plug ; to learn .
the best start to participate in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . instructions to login in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
when you start &amp; edit ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or remote folder here . simply enter the path name or click the Fol@@ der icon icon to select a folder .
in the second field , you will need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data storage is saved . this path remains the same for all image folders .
later you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ plug ; you will additionally use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am setting up collections
if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder . &amp; digi@@ came ; regards each sub@@ folder as an album . no image will be changed . while searching the folders , you will see a progress indicator like this :
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; sec@@ ures recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folders . this can be done by inser@@ ting one point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ liste do not have photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon .
once you have configured the base folder , you can get in &amp; digi@@ plug ; set up your digital camera . then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums .
if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help Roh@@ k@@ amer@@ a@@ Backup .
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h @-@ Decoder Options and Ro@@ h workflow .
an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ plug ; work together .
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transmission . for the actual transmission to the computer , the camera is often used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deriv@@ atives .
digi@@ plug ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 for communication with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , re@@ distribut@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which supports a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers .
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos are generally large files and trans@@ missions via the serial port are slow , this connection is now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails of digi@@ K@@ am can be read reliably . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow .
one of the most beautiful things about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; , Photo@@ album , Sho@@ vi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs .
modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier , &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes were made in &amp; digi@@ plug ; even perform .
to simplify the window , you can either remove the side@@ bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F .
drag and drop images works everywhere : you can put a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ bau@@ ma , above the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be stored in keywords , dates list or search .
- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , PNG , TIFF , Ro@@ h , Mo@@ vies and Audio
the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus filtering on the file name only works if this ind is displayed in the symbol view . which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Al@@ b settings .
the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view of your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk , after the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date on which the album was first created .
if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . select Import Photos to scan . you can also add a screen@@ shot directly to an album . select Import screen@@ shot .
to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it . in the pop @-@ up menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album .
an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album properties , you need to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu .
alb@@ um@@ - Coll@@ ections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be group@@ ed under a common name . the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos by selecting from the toolbar or view albums sorted by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do so in the collections options .
the album date : used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sorted by date .
the el@@ dest , average , new : these set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the passage of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , instead , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder .
when you first get an album in &amp; digi@@ plug ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol .
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu &amp; quot ; As an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
an album can always be included only in one collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window . album collections have a different effect . the collection always includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all images in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magni@@ fying buttons in the toolbar .
when you open an album for the first time , you have to wait for a while while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this allows you to avoid using the Tools Show all thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu .
information on each picture is displayed below the associated preview . which information is , you can change about settings digi@@ ti@@ zed ; change the albums page here and adjust the area thumb@@ nails to your wishes .
the thumb@@ nails have help windows that appear . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a picture . the screen shot at the top of the section Intro@@ duction to the main window shows such an auxiliary window .
photos are everything about &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; go . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can choose any of the features that come with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can choose between viewing the images , a slide show or editing the images .
you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... Select a guide on how to edit your photos . with image editing , you can view your photos and change them .
it can happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . the applications listed there will be checked by the &amp; k@@ de ; file assignments for the file type .
you should note that after processing other image processing programs , it is possible to avoid problems with the metadata that is included in the image . some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image . thus , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data such as orientation , aperture etc .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; provides two possibilities for rotation . the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview pane to select and rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
to change the file name of a photo , right @-@ click on the preview and select F2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) .
if you delete a photo from &amp; drop , it will be moved to the garbage bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del .
the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ limit &amp; quot ; organizes your photos using the data . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or if it is not available , the date of last modification of the file .
if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed .
photos with keywords provided provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos . tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . once a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again .
when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed .
keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this allows you to organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also easily find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword stays &amp; quot ; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for .
the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . so you can also use your keywords in other programs . in addition , the keywords will be re @-@ imported when &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; the pictures notice .
you can add new keywords by clicking on &amp; quot ; My keyword ; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword , after clicking on an existing keyword , this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword .
you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword is removed from this photo .
you can change the position of a keyword by dra@@ gging it to the desired position in the tree and put it down there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword . a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree .
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword ;
to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and select As Album Show in the context menu . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol .
to be able to use keywords , you must first provide your photos with keywords . this can happen in two ways : once you have selected the photos you are looking for with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword to assign to the context menu .
you can add a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc .
once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be shown in the main window under the thumb@@ nail .
you can remove a keyword with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu . the menu only shows you the keywords assigned to the photo .
the time beam view shows a time @-@ dependent adjustment of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved over this hist@@ ogram . to select a time frame you just have to click on the bottom rect@@ angle of the selection box that displays the time unit .
in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
includes all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps , and in the future even more .
next to the search box is a small light that will find the green when the search finds hits . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp will be red .
the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with bin@@ oc@@ ulars . if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above . you can save this search here but as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as search criterion . after you have saved it appears the filter in the list .
if you are satisfied with your selection , press the head OK and the search will be performed . the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window . if you want to change your search again , you just need to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in its context menu .
if you select to edit search , the search will appear again with the search information you entered . if you select an advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the Advanced Search section .
if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete in the context menu .
the Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; s database .
the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ bian database . each option can be added or deleted by operators . each option can be added to this list by means of logical operations All ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... You can create searches of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas .
similar entries : this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar . by means of a Schw@@ ell@@ ert , the selection of results can be enlarged or reduced . if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the unused search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there .
sketch : hands @-@ free colour sket@@ ches : draw a quick sketch and digi@@ plug ; find the right pictures . also here , a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it down and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , also raw files , together .
select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L To add the lumin@@ aire from the contex@@ tual menu . the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window , you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table .
from the preview bar , you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . if you select a preview of the toolbar and carry out zoo or move operations on one of the pictures , then you can also compare them with the other image . you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures .
another mode is better suited to quickly fade out of a series of images . if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it on the left side . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images .
of course , the normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting table , such as F@@ 4 file editing ....
all image information from the right side of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the illuminated table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
at the bottom of each section you will find a built @-@ in swivel function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows . to pi@@ voting the visible area of the image , you need to click them and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; then both images will show the same image area .
the zoom works just like in other views . simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out . this happens in both images when previ@@ ewing in the preview mode .
what is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers every part of the process after the image has been taken until the final issue and permanent storage . each of the photos absor@@ bs , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way .
we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we focus on downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , supporting , archiving , optimizing , waiting and ex@@ porting image files .
&amp; quot ; Digit@@ ale Stock Manager accepts , index@@ ed , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , assemble and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value .
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment .
I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not even need to find a certain photo without stock management . if you do not even know how many photos you have , then you certainly do not use &amp; digi@@ plug ; . the approach to store metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs , platforms and formats .
the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer . you have to decide if other access to your photos is to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive &amp; etc .
you may be happy with this structure . holiday rentals can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will be sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website .
professional photographers have different requirements , e.g. version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % Archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content .
what kinds of files fit together ? separation of file types makes batch processing easier . separate new from old files .
the separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
we also recommend that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are entered into the file in the Settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu .
now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change which ones ? to do so , you have to add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones .
now the real work starts , because you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to any photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the further work .
let us now use keywords , keywords , as you often want to use in other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing .
if you import catalo@@ gu@@ ed images from another source with embedded keywords , then you will automatically create the tree for you or insert the images to the right place . sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are edited by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; updated as it tracks the sub@@ trees .
the graph shows how different metadata is overl@@ apping . this is a very coarse representation as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections . filen@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images .
enough of the keywords - the next section refers to let@@ tering or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata .
you don &apos;t want anyone to see your photos just , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you &apos;re sure to be interested in your photos .
look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , you start to see some details , people , the place .
and now I tell you that this is the landing field of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start dre@@ aming to have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence .
for others who consider your photos the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you understand .
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a let@@ tering for itself alone .
with &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alphab@@ et ( U@@ TF @-@ 8 ) , as a cap@@ tion . if you export your images in web galleries , then these labels will be exported to your preferences in the let@@ tering and / or the title of the web gallery system .
remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet in front of Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light .
the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips by using pictures with Ge@@ ographical Information . you can also export k@@ ml files that you can open with Goo@@ gle@@ Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer .
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same fre@@ edoms are also valid in all changed versions , so also for the work of others .
the following description tells you which information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be stored :
author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator .
author title ( syn@@ onym for author &apos;s line ) : associated with the author . this field contains the job title of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a comment on the author &apos;s field , this must be filled out as well .
publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider field to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others .
it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they have no protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify them in the image . for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important .
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .

of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section you will find problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
K@@ roll on@@ TRA@@ CK , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss .
to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs these must be treated prud@@ ently and you may not be trusted for longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , harder to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years .
CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable .
CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if they have just been written . that &apos;s why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and check@@ sums . despite this massive protection , they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ;
for defective CDs and DVDs , there is a good program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks from damaged disks , hard disks , flash media , USB drives , etc .
optical media : Blu @-@ ray disks appear to win the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for Blu @-@ ray disc .
burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it in a clean , dark dry and protected spot . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media .
disc@@ ards retain your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer &apos;s products include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject : disk failure study
the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT , is the most common cause of error . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot determine this error . some of S@@ MA@@ RT &apos;s errors are the most common cause of failure .
this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files , but these losses can normally be restored without major problems .
while most electric devices don &apos;t matter much , this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage . on your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious key@@ boards , complete data loss , hardware aging , destroyed mo@@ ther@@ boards and other defects . so protect yourself from the unavoid@@ able that leads to a loss of time and money .
the most common protection against current peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy heat and gro@@ oves the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug connector . however , remember that not every connector bar also contains over@@ voltage protection .
if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard , which guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices .
since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage protection , which also includes a phone connection for your modem . others offer connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the television card .
if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem .
while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrupted power supply .
in addition to protecting from over@@ vol@@ tages , these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system in order . if you buy a UPS , you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting .
consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety in case of power failure with the cost of avoiding these . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it . finally , you should always remember all the cables before going to the holiday .
the Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data .
you are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet .
the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution .
Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed to photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited storage , which should only be checked in reality .
from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory .
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transfers are vulnerable to transfer errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard disk .
the worst thing about this is that no one tells you when a transfer error occurred , not when this occurred in your hardware . all these disturbances remain und@@ et@@ ected until you have been destroyed one day . it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer . no one ever seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer .
un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate interest within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed .
even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 , you will see thousands of errors a year .
Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows .
Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha @-@ status . it uses the same protective mechanisms using Z@@ FS and is also available for &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data losses in the not@@ ebook and 46 % at the work@@ station systems . in not@@ ebooks , the proportion of theft is 50 % .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to lower damage such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been sigh@@ ted for a long time .
open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ F@@ s and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems .
journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : un@@ true , only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost .
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss .
sensors from digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deterior@@ ate . even DSLR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DSLR cameras have your border at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . so you often backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives .
suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a flash will hit you if the drive wasn &apos;t connected right now .
a disaster hits local and destro@@ ys a lot . forget aircraft fragments : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house .
therefore , des@@ aster prevention always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighbour house , into your office or similar .
there is another advantage of physical separation : as stated above is a common reason for data loss despite backing up the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day .
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differentiation : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . create multiple sn@@ apshots . you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup is made . this backup comes with a version@@ ing system closest to the exception that it is only scann@@ ed and not running .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts , r@@ sync only copies the difference of the files that have really been changed . this happens comp@@ acted and if you want to increase security via s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium .
this approach lets you get enough time to detect and restore losses . at the same time you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month .
topics : metadata stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ enting images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , visual equipment , ... , use of the Internet .
so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered :
as the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate during the time . unfortunately , there is no other way to for@@ et@@ ell certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future .
this question should be answered by means of explanations in this document . use or change to open standards supported by many applications .
virtualization is now available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures , keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , storage and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard . stay with open standards .
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have planned scal@@ ability and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . with * nix systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and reloc@@ ate it to a new disk :
check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record has been detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang it .
/ dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ db &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollars ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of disk in MB@@ s ; # works with ext@@ 2.3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of the drive if needed
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no more software can read it , then you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it anymore .
PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF . it can save much more . it is loss@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 bits per color channel and full transparency . the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information , but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression .
TIFF was widely distributed as image format . TIFF may be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digit@@ ale Neg@@ ative File Format is a roy@@ alty @-@ free and open @-@ format image format developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG has been developed based on the need to uni@@ fy the camera &apos;s formats . it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata .
this may be one of the reasons why to replace Adobe its XML based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself .
many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can lead to problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file , and as mentioned above , the raw format is switched off . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put it together .
the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization supporting fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modelling , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices .
import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use it as temporary f@@ use .
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them to your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
you can use external programs for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered processing . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ plug ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these have been cut off by the other programs .
protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . first export them to web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ;
the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ plug ; to get . in the Adding a Photo to an Album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for im@@ porting images to your legacy database .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , connect it to the computer , turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera .
when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a he@@ y indicator appears at the bottom and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol are displayed for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. on the camera .
before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata .
this dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
the Metad@@ ata tab displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as in the metadata side@@ bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras .
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking on the Download button and then downloading the All . this loads all photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . when downloading , the photos are not deleted and we advise you to check if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
if you do not want to download all of the photos , you can only select the chosen ones with the default selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; as soon as you have selected the photos , use the download button and download the chosen ones . download the selected button as long as you have selected some photos .
if your camera supports this , an option New download@@ able is available . these pictures have not yet been edited by &amp; digi@@ plug ; downloaded . in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures are downloaded .
when you download the buttons All download or download Sel@@ ected , a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored . the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section . then select the target album from the list and click OK .
after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ plug ; download the photos from the camera to the album .
once you have downloaded the photos you have downloaded , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete them all at once by del@@ eting the Del@@ ete button . if you just want to delete some , you have to select them first and then delete the chosen ones .
please note that there is no way to restore the photos you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in a &amp; digi@@ plug ; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted ; if you want to completely delete the camera finder , you should do so via the camera menu , as this is much faster .
cameras often do not use meaningful names for the photos . the filen@@ ames are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to double file names if you upload photos from different cra@@ dles to the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name .
in the next section you will find options for rotating and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based om@@ bs . if you use this latter option , a folder will be created automatically per day .
the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk . the first two will concern the data about the author in the Standard Aut@@ ori@@ Identi@@ ty section . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the Ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images .
if you wish another date format than the standard format , you can , for example , use the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- to y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M : % S . to do so , turn the option Date &amp; Time . for further adjustments , you should read the help of the str@@ f@@ time command .
if you are using the option camera file name , you have the option to change the file names in lower@@ case letters . or in capital letters if you prefer .
the new file name , which &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shut@@ down . not all cameras provide this information . in the Metad@@ ata section , you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo .
the automatic rotation is usually turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t supply this information , you can get digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the automatic spin in the bottom of the window .
if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , &amp; digi@@ came ; this is used to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album by downloading . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ a data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos .
this option is usually disabled , and in this case , &amp; digi@@ plug ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you have to turn on this option . use the Advanced button and select the date @-@ based sub@@ title at the bottom of the window .
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button . then select Upload . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the default &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ plug ; you where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer .
GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this refers to a position indicated in length and width and which can be displayed on a map . the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system .
not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability .
if you later forgot where exactly the photo was made , you can open a browser that displays the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ plug ; users want to send users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo .
the question is , how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that ex@@ iv@@ 2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and map references . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the correct hardware , by post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and finally via manual input of known places .
as far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few working with GPS receivers . either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth .
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DSLR ri@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you must save these data in g@@ p@@ x format because this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping .
there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
if you want to know the long@@ - and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ if@@ Tool by Phi@@ l Harv@@ ey . it uses the pre@@ defined coordinates created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle for example .
map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European street maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; tries to give you so much control over its operations as possible . there are many settings that change the behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es.@@ To access these settings , you need to select in the menu Set@@ ting . select the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side .
select action can be set to preview or start screen editing . you place the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view .
this page contains , as shown below , the identity and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . also in case of a database synchronization , these data are written in IP@@ TC fields .
author &apos;s title is a syn@@ onym for the author of the author : this field should include the photographer &apos;s job title . these can be desig@@ nations such as a photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the field of authority , this must also be filled .
publisher is a syn@@ onym for providers : use this field to indicate the name that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency like Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be listed here . if the picture is a bearing photo , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here .
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC fields . by doing so , the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; imported without being lost .
save image cap@@ tions as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos using the labels embedded in the images . attention : with images that already contain labels , these are over@@ written by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed .
the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not .
&amp; # 160 ; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; to indicate , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . any file in a digi@@ plug ; album folder that has none of these extensions is ignored by &amp; digi@@ plug ; ignored .
the default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
the settings of the lumin@@ aire from &amp; digi@@ plug ; on this page you can set the default values . each time you open the lumin@@ aire these settings are switched on . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . if you have one , you can only get better results .
by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select them here . you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode .
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are defined here . in image processing , this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma sub@@ sampling it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia zur near@@ er explanation .
with the PNG compression setting , you can reduce the size of PNG files . this operation does not reduce image quality , because PNG uses a loss@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast calcul@@ ator , you can set this value to high compression . this means 1 : a low and 9 high compression .
the TIFF @-@ files option can be used to comp@@ ress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images . this reduces the size of the TIFF images . it does not affect the image quality since the default algorithm is loss@@ less .
with the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the loss @-@ prone setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG . when this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in planning .
in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing was only a picture viewer for photos . at the moment it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing .
the default value is that all green pixels are the same . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels at odd lines , this difference generates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method .
if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used .
this setting is only used if white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photograph@@ ed in sunlight .
this setting is only supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD S@@ LR cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in four steps . for other cameras this option is ignored .
the default is the pointed light , i.e. the parts of your images that are burned @-@ in due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed @-@ up white . use the setting pier@@ cing white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results since it displays the pointed @-@ lights in various pink tones . last but not least you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights .
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satisfy as fast as green and red . and d@@ rap@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
when you select the Rec@@ on@@ struction option , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image .
set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably have to set it a bit higher than the default 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing . in order to keep the time for de@@ hydr@@ ation small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively .
a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design .
&amp; D@@ cra@@ w provide you three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ated Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . however , it creates color art@@ ef@@ acts at the edges .
if you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color gra@@ ding correction , as it is done during the raw conversion .
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to return it . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information how to translate the color information from one color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files start .
color Profile folder Select here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you can save all your profiles .
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color @-@ managed , not the entire screen .
the input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model that you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color ton@@ mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w g@@ amma does not correct conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself .
there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of profile that you can em@@ ulate how your picture would be returned from a device . this is very useful before you print picture because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated . you could manually correct this rather than rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer .
for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for . unfortunately not with Canon models . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is , of course , un@@ official :
the Canon profile extension provides the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style .
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ kam ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are then downloaded from &amp; digi@@ plug ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will also find some in the context menu of the preview .
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short@@ cuts .
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper knob adjust@@ s the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display .
the camera features show on the left a list of all the cameras supported at the time . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in image display mode .
at the bottom you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( I@@ EE@@ E @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage c@@ ameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you need to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / user , where you can mount your camera .
to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ plug ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it to the display mode and turn on .
check out if you have digi@@ ti@@ sed ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu .
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can insert them here .
with the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the M@@ ül@@ lei@@ mer you can indicate the conversation of &amp; digi@@ kam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections delete a photos and delete an album you will find more details .
the editorial changes through the right side bar can be sil@@ ently supported by &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; if you use the option to apply changes in the right side@@ bar without promp@@ ting . otherwise , you will need to save the changes using the button changes .
you can also display the display of the welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ kam ; under certain circumstances this speeds up the start process of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; .
the setting When starting new photos is forcing &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the start time of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; if something has been deleted from the base folder , &amp; digi@@ came ; you know if it is to delete them from the database .
different color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from Settings Design from the toolbar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ plug ; to create , you will find more information on this in this tutorial .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item Display / Edit .
the image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; so you may not be part of your distribution . you can find more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules in the Image Processing section .
a status line at the bottom of the window , the filen@@ ame , current file number , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size indicate .
a menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
the editing functions of the image processing will change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or Save button Save from the toolbar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image .
so you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it . this can be done with File Save as .
as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or using the button The Rec@@ over of Rec@@ over the Image Processing in the toolbar . you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving .
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting Edit Return and Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore .
if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the back or restore button at the toolbar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored .
once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the toolbar , image high , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it .
you can zoom in and zoom into the photo in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu .
to customize a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the toolbar : automatically select magni@@ fication factor
view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come to the normal view in which you are using the Es@@ c key . usually , you can change this in the Settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ plug ; you can view it from the digi@@ plug ; main window . see the section to set up image editing .
if you want to print the current image , you can print in the File menu and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before you print your photo .
from the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets . all image preview pages can be printed from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Wizard from the Export menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right , providing important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation arrow , also in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked :
multiple Click on the same tab lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the margin .
in the label view you can enter or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . note the note below . the text is U@@ TF @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so you can be used by other programs .
the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2,000 characters . all comments will be trunc@@ ated after 2000 characters and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions .
after you have commented , use either the button user or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions will then be saved .
next to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images .
the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sor@@ tations . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the contex@@ tual menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field of Ur@@ gency . the coding follows the scheme in the following table :
the keyword display shows a search box to filter the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ pres@@ ets session .
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords .
the input field at the bottom is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords in a picture series . if you have entered different keywords , they are saved for quick access .
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field keyword .
if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please read the section keyword filter .
the Key@@ line keyword filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , - date , keyword and searches . if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed .
you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword .
in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar tag . the keyword filter is based on no words , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected using C@@ trl + a , and then a keyword was drawn from the right key tree to the selection and stored there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set .
this search for changes takes place at each start of the program . it can also be switched off under Settings Differ@@ ent .
if you have a rule with and have created and realize that it should be one or its , you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area .
( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc .
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
you can , for example , set an Advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options :
if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adjusted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable vari@@ ance from the actually photograph@@ ed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resem@@ ble those of your camera or scanner and that will publish the colors that you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room .
if the theme comes to color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result .
if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about color management .
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB color space . ( see below for more information )
their only other image outputs are via email or web , where s@@ RGB is the de facto standard .
so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one then use a different colour space and have to think about color drops ?
a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB color space , the tri@@ angular region .
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om &apos;s excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I need to sound my monitor when I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you have to calibr@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ it@@ or works on s@@ RGB . if you are working as a colour space of s@@ RGB then you must either sound your monitor on s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both .

this tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before you attempt to continue manual editing .
the functions Norm@@ alize , Comp@@ are , Automatic Balance and Con@@ trast extend from the Cor@@ rec@@ t automatic correction automatically try to make the most of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo .
norm@@ alize : this method scales the den@@ ial values across the entire image , leaving the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or well @-@ washed .
balance : this method adjust@@ s the intensity of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . it sometimes achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it .
automatic adjustment : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channels . it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust@@ s the red , green and blue channels to the entire hist@@ ogram range .
contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the wid@@ est possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible with well @-@ balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
the white balance correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8 bits per color . if you are too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure can occur . if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities for correction will be better .
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing .
the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image . the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool &apos;s preferences . if you want to see the original image again , click on the sub@@ window .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
right above is a hist@@ ogram showing dynamically changed once you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed .
the contrast of your result depends on shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shade adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim down .
to play an@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . in this way , the temperature and green values are set automatically .
in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of preferences . the following settings are available :
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed . you will get the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . each setting of the white balance you set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later .
the Pre@@ ferences button res@@ ets all filter values back to their default values and neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed .
you can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for formats PNG , P@@ N@@ M , TIFF , and D@@ NG .
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images . it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles . color ton@@ mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness . a detailed manual for using color profiles lets you consult the chapter colour management .
another important tool can be found in the menu under color correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for several photos . this is helpful when your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction .
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool colour effects will provide you with four color effects , a solar panel effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ister filter .
in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation , also known as sab@@ ati@@ er , was an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure replaced a short flash and afterwards the development of the image compl@@ ained . this had the effect that the brigh@@ ter areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second illumination . this tool allows you to fine @-@ adjust this interesting effect .
the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper .
this is an example of the solar panel effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that processes the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simply , it beauti@@ fies many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an in@@ verse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated colours are too much for some photographs , especially those of barely landscapes .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light to the contrast edges . the level parameter controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the thickness of the ne@@ on light . in large pictures the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos . you can also experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be viewed in preview . once you are satisfied with the result , use the O@@ k button and you will be applied .
if you make a photo in poor lighting conditions , you can get the reverse problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
between the complex tools Gra@@ dation and the simple Leu@@ ch@@ thickness / Con@@ trast / G@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure time . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you only need the scope of the slide . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram .
the window contains a graph of the intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas .
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes .
on the right , the original and the preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , using the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available .
sc@@ aling : this selection box shows whether the hist@@ ogram is represented with a linear or log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is most useful . in this case , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single column . in this case , the log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic classification is more useful .
three kno@@ bs : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values .
the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for fully automatic adjustment .
output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two kno@@ bs that can be used to change the output values as interactive as in the input values . for example , compression of output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is seen in the foreground .
automatic : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image .
save as and load : with these buttons , the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later . to do so , the Gim@@ p level format is used .
if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input values are automatically read@@ just@@ ed for all shadows , medium and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image with ( 2 ) .
on the left , half of the original and the target image will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available :
modified channel : this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module :
in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic view . for pictures taken with a digital camera , the linear mode is the most sensible . in this case , the linear mode generates a wide beam . in this case , log@@ ari@@ th@@ mic mode will help .
for example , if you move a curve arrow to the right , e.g. the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond with dark@@ er output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become dark@@ er .
preview the original photos is a red marker to see . if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change , a fitting line will appear on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste .
save as and load : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shade , middle and sun shades . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are displayed , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result .
below you can see a black and white photo , which was corrected in the lumin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mixer of the &amp; digi@@ plug ; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos .
the channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing .
the channel selection box allows you to select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precip@@ itation . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value .
the controls for the module are right down : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate lumin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness as well , as the channel mixer then is the tool to generate great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits .
sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color becomes a visible noise coming from the colour space . color is made up of small noise files that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you first reduce the color space .
the Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose . any mixer setting you can save for later and then load . the file format used is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
the Over@@ exposure indicator option controls all color channels to view over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result .
below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been read@@ just@@ ed . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the illustrated image below ( 2 ) .
black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be converted easily on the computer .

green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scenarios and fits perfectly to portraits of the sky . similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter .
orange Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter .
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate mo@@ on@@ light scenes at the time of the day , similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) rotor filter .
yellow Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ ap@@ at@@ onic . this is typical of the photos of your grand@@ mother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; applying tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall .
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the altered under ( 2 ) to see . the relief model has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame , the module can be started from image processing .
type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your picture . in depth the image is surrounded by a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , be@@ v@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative added a decorative frame with patterns .
width : specifies the width of the frame in percent . the range of values for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have previously used the tool after aspect ratio .
with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture in any place . this also works in several places if you need it .
this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . use text output , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you require . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background .
each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button OK . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed .
with the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool template can apply a template over a picture .
the Image Tem@@ plate menu can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation . however , you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to &amp; digi@@ plug ; send an email in English to the digi@@ plug ; mail@@ ing@@ list digi@@ plug @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
if you use this tool for the first time , you need to set your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder where you copied the templates files . these settings will be noted for the next start .
after setting the root folder for templates it appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil . the selection of a folder updates the template bar of the templates automatically .
under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shrink : this button res@@ ets the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you must res@@ ize the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button .
move : use this button to move the image below the template . to do so , take the picture and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture . the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but it produces , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images .
bl@@ ur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . actually it sharp@@ ens no bit , it works rather psycho@@ visually . you can use it to remove atmospheric mist and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by Win@@ ston Ch@@ ang .
re@@ focusing is possibly the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
photos without focus and most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of sharp@@ ness . this is because the digit@@ alization process has to summ@@ ari@@ ze colors with only minimal differences to a color point . this again leads to sharp edges a bit blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . S@@ LR cameras normally need more subsequent sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
for JPEG images a camera is often used for internal sharpen@@ ing . in contrast , images in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing .
some scann@@ ers use a sharp@@ ness filter during reading the image . if you turn off this , you will get control of your image .
in some situations you can get usable results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing value . you can use the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sharpen@@ ing .
you should be careful with this as the results do not naturally work : the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also enhances the noise . generally , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing a picture is re@@ focuss@@ ing . you can re@@ focus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpen@@ ing .
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp m@@ ask@@ ieren is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview help to edit the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings .
there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or the amount increase the effect . if you make the bl@@ ur mask strong , noise and the impression of gr@@ en@@ ades are created close to sharp edges .
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow bigger radi@@ i . therefore , you should shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . this allows for a minimum difference to define for an edge of the filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from shar@@ per and therefore , beauty errors in faces , sk@@ ies and water surfaces are avoided .
this is an example of the un@@ sharp m@@ asked filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool re@@ focus a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted de@@ f@@ alt@@ ation filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to get an image to &amp; quot ; re@@ focusing . this is better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Viennese filtering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing pictures is using a bl@@ ur mask . re@@ focus reaches usually better results than blur@@ red . you can start it from the menu by re@@ focusing colors in image processing .
in practice , the fis@@ sure fis@@ sion is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ ies that are far from the original source pixel . in most cases , the FI@@ R Wiener In@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding is influenced by the distant pixels even very strongly .
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should yield 1 good results . you can set a higher value if your image is very blur@@ red , but pay attention to hal@@ o notes .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . the correlation can be chosen from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module .
noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce art@@ ef@@ acts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality is very bad . a usable value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will even further pol@@ lu@@ te the image .
Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ring is authentic . in most cases , you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a non@@ zero value , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter .
matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . however , please note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you set will be stored for later and can then be loaded .
try to do all cutting , color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module .
otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations that are not visible immediately , but leave behind unpleasant arti@@ facts .
if you read and comp@@ ress images , &amp; eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image .
generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by using the blur@@ red mas@@ king a greater neighborhood than sharpen@@ ing .
theore@@ tically , un@@ sharp mas@@ king must always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of bl@@ ur . for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practically the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the bl@@ ur mask . the FI@@ R Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details .
below you can see a comparison between the different filters , applied on a small un@@ focused image :
the original blur@@ red color image has to be corrected . this image has been taken with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the methods for the correction of sharp@@ ness in digital images , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address .
the sli@@ der controls the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened in order to generate a more natural pup@@ il .
the ink tin@@ ts allow a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can set this here .
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration . the options available are listed below :
if you want to fine adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab smo@@ othing and advanced settings .
detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to uniform smooth@@ ness over the image . whereas larger values are mainly smooth@@ ed by homogeneous regions and details . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary .
direction dependen@@ cy Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction . if you have a movie gra@@ ined or CCD ru@@ stling will produce a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
smooth &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smo@@ othing factor beyond all@@ it@@ . p then defines the relative smo@@ othing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
repeat : specifies how often the algorithm is passed through . normally , 1 or 2 is sufficient .
angle step width is &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if alpha is chosen small , small angles should also be selected . therefore , make sure that small angles make a long term . thus , you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs .
integral stepping width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step width in pixels . you should set the value of less 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smo@@ othing and never larger than 2 .
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more on quality that you get by selecting this option is only low . it dou@@ bles the duration . we therefore recommend it to om@@ it it .
the Save As and Load buttons do exactly this . any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and get a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button .
below you can see how to remove image errors with small art@@ ef@@ acts . the module is used on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is a strange black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts that come from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines .
if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial .
the screen@@ shot at the top shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window Advanced Settings can remain with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel are needed and can control the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor f@@ laws cleared .
sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is increased , the adaptive filter will no longer be able to obtain image details and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again .
edges : controls edge accuracy for sharp@@ ness . this value improves the filter &apos;s response . if it is too strong it cannot be removed the entire noise or noise peaks can occur . set it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ fact without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process that is controlled by the details pane .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smo@@ othing process which is controlled by the details pane .
g@@ amma : controls the g@@ amma @-@ tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dark@@ er areas , which are typically more strongly rough@@ ened . however , it also contam@@ in@@ ates the shadow areas .
atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the adjustment of the phase shock absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . if it is on its minimum , noise and phase j@@ itter may appear at the edges .
save under and load : these buttons are used for this purpose . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected one ( 2 ) . the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use the tool to sof@@ ten the sof@@ tness with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to remove g@@ auss &apos;s noise , movie gra@@ bbing , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or later digit@@ alized pictures .
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping . the texture mapping is performed using a different tool , image error correction . the restoration algorithm has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
JPEG Art@@ ef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Art@@ ef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that are to be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
the Save as and Load buttons do exactly this . any hi@@ ring of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and get a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button .
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction . the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner . you can see the scan art@@ ef@@ acts caused by the scanner lighting and photo paper . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixels from photos using a CCD camera like 8 . it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pix@@ i project , which are copy@@ righ@@ ted by Martin Dick@@ opp .
bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photographs because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels .
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; light Pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the dark image . the tool will detect automatic the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels through CCD defects .
first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard re@@ members the last dark image and loads it automatically in the next session .
the image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image . the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview sections .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
cut : an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of square corners ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image .
wide angle lenses , in particular those in medium and large photo format , can often not evenly illumin@@ ate the entire sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ ading ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . telep@@ hot@@ o lenses may also show this behavior .
but it also has disadvantages . many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter , which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter , an aperture of f / 16 or less , since there are otherwise blur@@ ring effects caused by movement .
with the large expos@@ ures of today &apos;s filters and the color or grey stage depth of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter . the tool vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture . the algorithm is protected by John Walker .
with three regul@@ ators you can control the vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image .
density : this parameter controls the degree of brightness damp@@ ing at the point of the greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly a luminous intensity of 2 . increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting .
den@@ ial , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . the controls only provide you with positive values , as you only need to increase the settings .
if you want a fin@@ er read@@ just@@ ment of the target image , set the values for luminous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the menu . image processing from the menu Color Gra@@ dation .
this is an example of the vig@@ net@@ ting correction on a picture . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vig@@ net@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David H@@ od@@ son .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected using this tool .
the coefficient of the second crest deals with the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or conve@@ x form of the image .
the coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect , flat however at the edges . this correction is not applied in the mold .
the coefficient 4th degree correc@@ ts the remote corners to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated .
general : this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree . negative values can be corrected using tone @-@ shaped distor@@ tions and positive values of cushion distortion .
corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value is stronger at the margins than in the middle of the image . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter &apos; has the inver@@ ted character of the parameter .
zoom : this value res@@ izes the image size and thus creates a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image dimin@@ ishes .
brigh@@ ten : this value adjust@@ s the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start .
the tone or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all trimm@@ ing or size changes . the best result is this correction than the first one . if you re @-@ cut a picture and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect is apparently the wrong .
to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line . move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to display the dotted lines . move it to an important location , such as the edge of the sea or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point .
if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these from the editing tool from the editing or zoom sli@@ der of this dialog using the cutting tool in the Edit menu .
the next logical step for some motifs such as images from the front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand , you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective .
this is an example of the ton @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org web page which is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ inf@@ rar@@ ot@@ film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image .
below the preview you can set two parameters for film gra@@ ying and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the Add Movie gra@@ ined option if you want to simulate the gra@@ ined texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO knob changes the amount of film size and domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) . green meadows are white like snow !
since the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing .
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top @-@ light .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter Panel is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures . this is known from classic high speed movies such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emul@@ sion .
the film @-@ grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street @-@ photographic , gra@@ iny view specially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you have to use this filter .
the controller can calibr@@ ate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times .
this is an example of the film @-@ grain effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thi@@ cker brushes are better suited for large images . smo@@ othing controls the smooth@@ ness or , viewed from the other side , the hin@@ ge .
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; filter carbon capture uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage ze . the lines that define the outlines in drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to outline yourself . this would be good pictures to start with .
there are two kno@@ bs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adjust@@ s the contrast ( smooth@@ s ) .
this is an example of the coal drawing filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
the &amp; digi@@ plug ; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was stamped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey , mon@@ strous landscape .
the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting .
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
shaft Blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks .
wave Block 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 , the image is distorted along with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time using the Cancel button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom on blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image along star shaped lines that originate from a center point . this simul@@ ates blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radial blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to be back to the background .
motion blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera .
sof@@ tness : blur@@ ring the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , gl@@ am@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow .
shaking blur@@ ring : blur@@ ts the image through random shifting of the pixels and thus simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the color bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes them without changing the rest .
mos@@ aic : divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it , by filling with an average pixel value , new .
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Select .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make rain@@ drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses a algorithm protected by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image , it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of the drops . fish eyes change the optical effect of the drop in the picture .
you can drag &amp; drop ; image editing needs to keep an area free of rain@@ drops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter rain@@ drops , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops .
this is an example of the rain@@ drops filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can place it in the right direction by mirr@@ oring or turning . the tools can be used in the menu Transform@@ ers Rotation or Transform@@ ers mirr@@ oring .
photo infl@@ ating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of picture quality .
the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and hold the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached ? how can you restore or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
change the tool to size using a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to infl@@ ate .
many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ ated was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below :
maintain aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size .
regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value , the more is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; tur@@ mo@@ il effect it has to be set higher than 3 .
the Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose . it can be saved as a text file and loaded later .
photo infl@@ ating is very fast with what it does , but it can last very long and pull a high CPU load after you . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish .
you can see below an example of photo infl@@ ating by enlar@@ ging a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard enlargement .
editing a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to compile a picture . to trim a photo you simply need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse .
when you release the mouse button again , the area of the photo will be cut off . this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting . you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rect@@ angle .
once you are satisfied with the cutting , use the button The C@@ trl button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly @-@ trimm@@ ed photo .
in the preview pane , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact .
depending on the aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format . in the portrait format , the greater value of the height and the cross @-@ format of the width is always assigned .
the tool according to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . for example , you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio .
at the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically .
at the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max . relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation .
when you use the trimm@@ ing tool the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in EX@@ IF tables , so that EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image .
the settings of the integration help make it possible to hide help so that you can put together your pictures better . these aids are :
harmonious triangle : harmonic divisions are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ thirds , harmonious tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle with similar harmonic tri@@ angles on the diagonal .
golden center : the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful .
the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty .
the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous figures . the descending part is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden center .
the gold center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
the Golden Spi@@ ral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow on this kind .
another rule is the rect@@ angles of the golden spiral , also called golden rect@@ angles . this rect@@ angles are used to create the golden spiral . it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects .
the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above . their verti@@ ces are the central points of the sides of the golden rect@@ angles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are no equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can be released a static object more dynamic .
when you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve differently .
the options Horizon@@ tal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic partitions .
with the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image .
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
if you make a photo then it is easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal . this creates a picture in which things are rot@@ ated around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ plug ; image processing and the tool free rotation .
rotate your image with the slide angle . the values on this slide are given in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slide again to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section .
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Transform@@ ieren Zu@@ Cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to trim the image is automatic cutting . select one of the following options :
the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option leaves the image a little bit after the turn . however , note the above warning .
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed by a fixed point to the so @-@ called point of reference . this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective :
new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation in pixels .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the upper right : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area .
angle left : shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a bit dirty . for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible .
after you &apos;ve adapted the perspective you get un@@ happy tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
the drawing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part in the opposite direction . for example , horizontal she@@ ar will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the image is distorted into a parall@@ el@@ ogram .
sh@@ ear@@ ing your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle is set to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane .
to your help , a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the moving tool to adjust your image .
after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture gets a bit blur@@ red . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two insul@@ ations generate twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this .
after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the picture has un@@ sigh@@ tly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to remove it is to cut the picture with Transform@@ ers cro@@ pping out of the image processing .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the formats available depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ plug ;
due to this dependen@@ cy on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on your system . however , you will always find JPEG and TIFF among them .
&amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; shows only files in formats that you know . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , you can change this list of file extensions the &amp; digi@@ plug ; change . in the Configuration section you will find more information about this .
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TIFF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia .
image compression is the application of data compression methods on digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save the image data in a more efficient way .
JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s version can also save loss@@ less if specified in the settings .
if you want to learn more about the raw image format , you can read very helpful guides in English at Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images in JPEG or TIFF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ ti@@ .@@ In the section Configuration you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed ; .
&amp; digi@@ plug ; supports loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which is included in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ es. more than 200 raw file formats are supported . all supported cameras can be viewed at the bottom of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw materials that are supported by &amp; digi@@ plug ;
many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often saved in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format ; however , this formats and will generate preview for the movies . &amp; digi@@ kam ; but is not a movie editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to preview movies or edit . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ plug ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies use to start playing the program .

many tools you need to update the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ ti@@ zed ; included . your description follows here .
all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise reduction , re@@ focusing , blur@@ red , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog box that displays the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below , see &amp; quot ; Tex@@ ture App@@ ly quot ; in this dialog :
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter to the current picture . to the left of it , five buttons allow the comparison mode of the preview area to be changed . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview pane .
horizontally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper section shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview pane .
the left compartment shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
split horizontally . the upper section shows the original and the bottom to compare the effect of the filter .
&apos;@@ mouse over &apos; -@@ style : shows the preview if the mouse is not in preview pane and otherwise the original .
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can turn on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general setup page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the Properties tab displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos . these data are from EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it down and move it . move it while you click the left mouse button . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
the pallets files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de can be applied either to the whole system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Settings and Hot Custom color and Fin@@ ally used colors .
in the palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders by files .
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the color is described under the pallet view . here , the color name can also be changed .
it can also be used for choosing . to create such a selection , click the area next to a color to move the cursor to it . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button .
if the check box Bei@@ m C@@ ursor is activated under the button Color , the color is inserted from the color table at the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ written another ; depending on whether the over@@ write mode is selected . this mode you can set by selecting the check box Over@@ write under Bei@@ m cursor .
a selection that has been created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions copying , cut and paste .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the portions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character , if there are three numerical values in the clip@@ board , they can be past@@ ed as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit .
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
choose a color somewhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left .
graphs are used for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the programs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there was no modern &amp; GUI ; program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , which &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; contains , are according to the program author ob@@ sol@@ ete &amp; X11 ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions .
the &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; graphs ; programs are free layout programs . &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; on . it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; k@@ ate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; k@@ rate ; re@@ comp@@ uted the graph and in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; k@@ ate ; open or open the graph in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; in a &amp; k@@ ate ; component to open
load large graphs ( currently there are problems starting from around 1000 k@@ not and a h@@ ack to show more than these nodes )
further required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; tool &amp; dot ; for the representation of graphs . required in detail :
the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; without starting an argument , the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot . in this case , the toolbar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog .
after selecting one or more / dot ; files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot :
as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically .
use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum com@@ min@@ ution of a graph .
if the currently in &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; loaded file has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed :
you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; set up ... use , see also .
if you open a graph file outside a current &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; instance , or if you want to display the graph in a sub @-@ window of the current instance .
as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog .
at program start you can let all graphs of your last session open again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later .
you can also specify how the graph should be split to multiple pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected .
if you use several pages , you can choose whether the portions of the graph , which come to a page , should be fitted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled out by the parts of the graph .
page preview with a graph distributed over several pages without header and with a different font
the Er@@ ne@@ ut Shop page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive , &amp; eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program every time .
the Open site gives the ability to specify the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; to specify when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can specify a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) or determine that each time is requested .
the Se@@ at Management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of &amp; k@@ graphi@@ viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not ) or determine the files of the last session or decide to be asked for each start .
the context menu , which usually appears in one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; opens up more possibilities :
here you can choose from different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z website , are :
&amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for directional graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of aligned graphs . the algorithm places the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges as possible .
the &amp; n@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for un@@ finished graphs . it produces displays according to the spring spring model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm generates a spr@@ ing@@ spring model for un@@ executed graphs . it uses the Fru@@ et@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ uris@@ tic , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs .
the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm as@@ signs the nodes in a circular manner according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures .
open a dialog where you can specify a layout command , which will then be executed by a shell . the command should display the graph file as parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can specify special options , or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn .
specifies the type of graph ( directed or executed ) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type to ( dot ; for directional , &amp; n@@ ato ; for un@@ executed graphs ) .
if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not be displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active .

the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have k@@ oo@@ ka and san@@ e installed .
when you open the menu item images , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick up the image . you can also set the default source for the next time .
after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will pop up by selecting the default values duc@@ r@@ he can replace your image accordingly . see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button . the estimated file size will be shown in the right , bottom corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information .
make sure the window is completely displayed , as some settings might not be displayed otherwise .
after pressing the scanner you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to specify the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore create very large files . you also need to select or create the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image .
you can create screen@@ shots after selecting Import &gt; Screen Photo ... from the menu . a window appears where you can set the different screen settings :
select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
if all of your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window is read under the mouse .
the delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other work@@ tops , you should select this delay enough to have the time to navigate .
after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog will display options of the target image with the options described above .

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management on the Internet . Fli@@ ck@@ r allows you to send your photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world .
the Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . it is used for your authentication . it is thus virtually your identification to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can login to Fli@@ ck@@ r .
after successful registration , the module can send photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r website . the following page will be presented after successful registration .
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after pressing Yes , you will get the dialog for up@@ loading photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will appear in the next section .
if the module Export to Fli@@ ck@@ r is launched twice , you will be welcomed with the following dialog , which displays the current access permissions that the module displays . to upload , you need write permissions . the module does not currently support any other permissions . you will be asked if you wish to continue with these permissions .
the button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . click the O@@ k button to start up@@ loading the photos to the Fli@@ ck@@ r server .
the keyword field can be filled with a comm@@ a separated list of words . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
with options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie , you can set the permissions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private .
if you choose the option to change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos will be changed in size before up@@ loading . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size .
the maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images . the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
the K@@ IP@@ I Module gallery export currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image . geographic data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
the K@@ IP@@ I geographic loc@@ alization module provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and width are used .
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the g@@ p@@ x format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ men can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the above @-@ looking dialog appears then . to maintain a possible correlation over time and loc@@ alization , you will need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were taken at the same locations at the same time as the images of your camera .
if the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera vision must be rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated with the GMT . this can be done with the time zone .
the setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera vision . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value is 2000 seconds .
if you do not have track data from one location for images , you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file and add it to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relations to inter@@ pol@@ ate .
the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog opens the coordinates from a call to the next , you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo .
the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . to do so , select the region and increase si@@ e.@@ Inclu@@ de this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the card can be changed between map mode , satellite image and mixed mode .
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded U@@ TF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization .
the module has four tab@@ s in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you just need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums . in the area below , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear .
the rider &apos;s appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be created in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your default picture viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show
the tab defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Suite containing everything will be created there .
if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images .
with other color depth , you can change the default color depth . of course , it also influences file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the tab thumb@@ nails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery .
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Cancel to cancel the process .
if the module has created the pages , the window will not be automatically closed . you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occurred while generating . the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery . press C@@ lose to close the module .
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool to view images .
the K@@ IP@@ I Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or moving . the viewer can be used with short commands and ma@@ sts . it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions .
after the start , a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode .
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ free module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality .
this module allows you to store images in JPEG format for the actions listed below , without the usual losses of quality or metadata .
the consequence of the loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , because no compression of the color information takes place . this can also be found in PNG format .
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation , please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
with the Import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function . this will open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata .
this function does not work for all image formats . you can copy from anywhere but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported while writing . please look at ex@@ iv@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Co@@ dec module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
the MPEG Co@@ di@@ mmer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages . you can also add a basic image transfer between the individual images . you can also add an audio file to the MP@@ 2 or WAV of the slideshow .
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . in addition , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
you first need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au . then you can create the module using Extras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
the images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list .
after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to re@@ play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pre @-@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe .
in the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture . the speed of the image transition is defined below . a low value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth picture change .
the background color can be set next . in case of doubt , you should leave it black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file .
if you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you have adjusted all settings to your needs , you can use the button encoding the creation of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now go fast or in all silence to enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back .
if a note appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Image@@ Mag@@ ick packages via the Settings button at the bottom .
the printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . these combined images can also be automatically opened using image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print directly with the Gim@@ p module .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG , TIFF or P@@ PM .
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : expect d@@ rap@@ w not to create the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ rap@@ w ! .
first select the RAW file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window then appears in mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image .
you can now re @-@ adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later .
a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect .
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the filen@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a loss@@ less algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the Tag@@ ged Image Format , TIFF , keeps all the information of your image and uses the loss@@ less LZ@@ W compression .
if you are planning to process your images frequently , or if you later intend to use it elsewhere , you should not choose JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TIFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to retain the original data .
if you select JPEG as a memory format , the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information .
if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the output button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Cancel .
batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are certain , e.g. by testing on a single image that are the best settings .
the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing files . this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed .
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it also uses the program convert from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album .
this module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can zoom or enlarge the image .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option , for example , to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : no proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
printing Pre@@ pare : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , border size and background color , is adjusted accordingly .
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . more images can drag and drop them to the list of images to be sent .
after you have launched the module , the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected . you can add more images using a file selection dialog . for the last selected image , a preview will be shown on the right .
you can also drag images to the picture list and put it there to add the list of images to be sent .
with the Pictures button remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent .
after you have selected all the images , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you only have to add the addresses and the subject here . the images selected by you are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
make sure not to send too many images at once . most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures .
the email window is used to change settings for sending images . your configuration is saved and used every time you change it .
select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below .
if you are using the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here .
after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments on the images will be merged into a text file and the mail is enclosed .
the PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to loss@@ less formats such as TIFF . therefore , you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and do not want to change the photo quality . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format .
if you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original if@@ config files will be added to the images to be sent .
when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors . however , your e @-@ mail program will automatically start at the end .
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album .
the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation enable very elegant image transitions with Open@@ GL . however , you must have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow .
the Show filen@@ ame option ensures that the filen@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c ; Cancel .
the option images random@@ ly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the order of images in the album .
the time distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures . 1500 milli@@ seconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . so you should test it before you show your friends !
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly , each transition between the images sel@@ ects a different effect .
during slide show , you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn on .
with this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show .
at the bottom of the screen you can see the current filen@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date has no documentation at the moment . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface .
this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop .
as soon as you have completed your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; by these browsing , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , are now available in each group , i.e. in persons , places and in the group keyword entries .
in the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF based information , view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumb@@ nails .
when you press the mouse over the entry , the view of the browser changes . see picture .
if you select another person , only the images displayed on which both persons can be seen . by using this selection method , you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images .
when you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images in your area of action .
in the picture each person has the same icon before their name . you can save with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you have defined .
to view images in addition to the names , select the button located on the right outside of the toolbar . in the appearing context menu , you can select which view you need to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have suitable images for your keywords ) .
however , you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual . to do this , you will need to open the image review window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu . here you can select the image for the appropriate person . in the check window , you can adjust the magni@@ fication factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off .
when you search for the search in the main window , a dialog appears , which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog once again on the image .
if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date for searching ; the date can be either a part of the total dat@@ as@@ et , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two dates , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 .
with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images on specific names as you can see in the picture . click here for pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene .
this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manuals but rather try the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual :
go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos .
start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , start the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry in the menu Help menu . then some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try it .
if you prefer to print this hand@@ book , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download .
at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database .
the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays another unit . you can switch between units years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10 @-@ minute sections .
the tim@@ eline can be used inter@@ actively in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image will display this date in the preview pane ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane .
you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button pressed and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select an area , you will only see images of this time in the preview pane . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version is described , which you can create via the menu file HTML ...
before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and finish . in the following , each section is described more accurately .
first , enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file should contain later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML sample pages you see an example of these settings .
next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created which is shown on the overview page . more information about the export files can be found in .
finally , you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages . thus , you can avoid that information displayed to the viewer is obvious even without description . for example , that all pictures are displayed by a party . note that all pictures are exported . you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific pictures from certain viewers .
in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are un@@ ambig@@ uous , which is why it is not specifically discussed .
at the bottom of this page you can set up different resolutions for the images , so those who want to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 will not download images that have , for example , a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 .
the viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you set . so it can browse your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if it wants to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution .
in this setting area you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored .
the best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set .
first , select the main folder where all your images will be saved . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this allows you to specify the location for all future pictures . here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example :
after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to viewers . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created will be launched . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder .
if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them to it . in order for the import function , see , properly , you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located .
the setting options described above have related all three to base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in the output folder .
if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures . however , if you have spent a lot of time looking for image information , persons on the pictures , recording location , etc . then you have to do this work again .
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if only a link to images is stored in the file . the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file can be passed on as independent . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size .
you can either export a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the Export menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file .
an external .@@ k@@ im file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are in the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched . this is of course only possible if you created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export .
in the following the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the Export ... menu .
the main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
with the Man@@ ually copy option to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file .
with the Automati@@ sch option to copy near the .@@ k@@ im file copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small , it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option .
the last option of this page is maximum picture size limit . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very large . for example , you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide .
if you select a file with extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu ... select , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in .
the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images are to be copied .
it may be that you specify the category persons of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called persons . therefore , in the third dialogue window , you will be asked in the third dialogue window to import the categories of the file to be imported and what categories they match in your database .
in the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . an example can be seen in the picture .
it has to be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted .
in this manual you will see the various steps of ( 1 ) specifying the information about your images , about ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options .
K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program to manage your pictures . it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes videos with one .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file index@@ .x@@ ml in the top@@ most folder of your images . it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a floppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want it .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; re@@ members the folder where your images are stored and automatically use it for future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / Company / Pictures / index@@ .x@@ ml .
the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual you will be able to explain the different settings .
to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option .
it describes how you can define different properties for each picture , e.g. persons , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups like objects , animals or albums .
see the dialog used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
in the Options section , sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in .
in the list of options listed above , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares his modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . more information about this can be found on the Ki@@ pi homepage .
the modules can be called up via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , since they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself .
since the modules of several applications are used together , it may be that the modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are tested ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or via the Help menu . do not say I would not have warned you !
the applications that the modules share via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications .
the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that K@@ IP@@ I also use is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums . even if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; this sort of order does not support , it simul@@ ates for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ;
this simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which is just the current view , so all images that show you the picture preview right now .
next to the current album , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also have a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s Browser shows the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module .
or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so , so if you have selected people to view and pass this on to the module .
since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . to do so , start the setup dialog and select modules to load modules .
on the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see at the top a menu bar and a toolbar . under the toolbar you can see the window that you have entered your image database . in the following section , we will return to this window , but now click on the picture that shows you an overview of all existing pictures .
one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see any picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the people who are shown in the picture , etc . you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen .
all these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
see three lists with a text box by setting people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you can always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures .
the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are shown , you can , by moving the names used up , find and assign the people more quickly .
if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list .
if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each picture individually , you might want to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes . in this case , simply click the one before and back buttons , which are below the thumb@@ nail to the right .
if you have recorded several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Multiple Mess@@ ages at once with a note .
Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S. . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California .
the picture shows a browser window that displays the USA as an over@@ lap . to show you that it is an over@@ lap , a special symbol is displayed .
in the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also simply drag an entry into a category and drop it down to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this pres@@ upp@@ oses that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically .
you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame . you can also make your own window from a frame by drawing it outside the window area .
if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window .
you can also fade out a frame completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then add / hide windows . this process you will see in the picture .
if you select the display pictures in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images if you have not set filters . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button .
if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set as a background image for your desktop .
once you click on a picture , it will appear in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new display window will be created .
you can also delete images in the preview window . simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Del@@ ete from the Edit menu . now you will see the window that you can see in the picture .
&amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; offers you a solution for this problem . you can also use &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also have the pictures stored somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can record the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the picture you see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all the needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive .
images in which the right upper corner is trunc@@ ated are not stored on the hard drive . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , the thumb@@ nails are present for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 . however , you can &apos;t view these pictures with the image viewer .
as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back into it . if you want to avoid h@@ ass@@ le about how to avoid m@@ ess of your pictures , please buy a larger disk to store all images on it .
in the menu pictures you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images in such a way that at the end ones you want to disable for others and click Rec@@ ent view lock in the menu Privacy . alternatively , you can also view all the images that your little sister may view , control and block the menu item All except current view .
this allows you to set which images are to be hidden in the case of the case . if you now give your laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu item images , so that all images you have blocked can be hidden . if you want to get the images displayed again , click on lock .
it is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select Password in the Privacy menu .
please keep in mind that this protection is not very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other everyone can access or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to look at the view of private images .
the reason you are all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them some@@ time . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; on a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview as described in .
you can see the viewer in it . of course it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc .
if the info@@ box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , you can drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all . all of these options are available after right @-@ clicking on the viewer .
some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see the matching entries to this display . so if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene .
if you have uploaded several images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by clicking the image high and the image down . you can jump to the first and last image with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu .
if several images are loaded in the viewer , you can run them as slide show . then a new image loads after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus .
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it is able to switch to full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input key to switch back to full screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply draw a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button you can zoom out again The Plus button zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the result of the zoom .
with the dot key you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the uni@@ formity key sets the zoom so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image .
note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out are with the plus and min@@ us@@ aste .
with the script functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work for videos . you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
if you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names . however , you may prefer to mark only the picture and view more pictures .
another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one .
for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the opportunity to see pictures with features while you look at them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature that you press the corresponding letter . in see a picture where the features A , B and C are set .
as soon as you have set features on your images , you can see them in your browser . so , if you have all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , just add them all at once . this is described in . after that , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do .
categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen . if you can view categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case , you will be allowed to paint on the picture .
the ch@@ amo@@ is is not stored with the image , but in the database . in this way you can undo your painted later .
in , you can see a picture on which was painted . to switch the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; switch on the picture color from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window .
to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must have the application of the program &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; not fully dominate , but the documentation on &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; you should have read and understood .
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow .
you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an object that is already selected , since all objects are already selected with the object .
to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu .
if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position :
you can remove selected objects from the scene with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button .
if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with a fault description . then you can correct the input errors and click App@@ ly or disc@@ ard the changes with Cancel .
if you enter the path to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help .
you need the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ M@@ TL user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation .
when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the properties pane .
press preview in the properties pane and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default the whole texture is rendered , even if you want to render a part of the texture ( for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , cross local .
the screen shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
when a transformation is selected , the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window .
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the Visi@@ bility level of the higher @-@ level object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level chosen in the toolbar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right .
if you don &apos;t like the default window arrangement , or if you need another arrangement , you can set them arbitr@@ arily . you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different configurations .
to anchor a window over or below a view , drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then displays the new position .
to create a new column , drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anch@@ ored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height .
if you want to arrange multiple views over each other , drag the beginner right in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the tab card in the top of the views .
the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anch@@ ored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the beginning bar .
to close a view , click on the small cross in the beginning bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross .
you can insert additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you can find entries for each type of view . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any point .
the current window view can be saved with View window arrangement ... saving . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
if you have created a scene , you can render them ren@@ der@@ . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual was written , &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; 3.5 topical . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 .
to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ ders icon in the toolbar or select the View scene menu item .
a render mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of render modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality .
if you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View R@@ ender Mode menu , the following dialog will be opened :
each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but useful is a name that lets you know the properties of the mode .
in the map file size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields .
in the combination field quality you can select the properties , the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex @-@ diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; .
if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , several errors can occur . these images often have a mo@@ ir@@ é pattern or tier effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better .
if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super sampling .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive , because the super sampling gets the adjacent pixels with one . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sive because every pixel is always further divided and adapted because the recur@@ sion depth depends on the calculated colours .
if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray uses a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels exceeds the given threshold , then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4x4 is calculated , with a depth of 5 then 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel .
the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel .
diff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ pixels that are individually followed and checked for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value .
another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you turn on j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns .
the last setting for quality of rendering is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; the diff@@ use light reflex@@ ion is calculated . it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property .
on this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object .
opens a new window for displaying the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ends , you can find the reason for it here .
to import a &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; select Import the menu item file ... and select a file in the dialog box .
currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command range of &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog box displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ R@@ aw@@ End .
you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; this adds to the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree .
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; render a scene . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
if you click on Help in the property view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation on the displayed object . set here the path to your document and version . supports versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 .
&amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; searches for external files ( e.g. height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene file , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used .
the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying the selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates .
you can set the object @-@ start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wi@@ re@@ model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and turns .
larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time to render . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the detail level separately for two directions .
if you cross high level of detail for extended projections , all wi@@ re@@ design views will be further divided when the camera uses an extended projection . extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projection . this property results in better approxim@@ ation for projections , but requires more time to render .
if you cross the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
if you cross soil , a bottom is rendered underneath the objects . the bottom is represented in a check@@ er@@ board pattern from two adjustable colors .
when you check edge smo@@ othing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling value can be set . exact information on the parameters can be found in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section .
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window arrangement section it explains how to create and save window orders .
the Com@@ bin@@ ation field Standard window arrangement : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove .
every window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name displays all views of the selected window arrangement . you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button .
with New Col@@ umn , create a new column on the right of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anch@@ oring the window under the existing window , with tab card you get a map map view together with the previous view and floating anch@@ ored the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window .
so you have just &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; install and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level .
but you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you are using a 3D program for the first time , you should observe these important rules :
if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture .
if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you will get only a black picture .
if you have installed everything correctly , you will see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement :
take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you first need to remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Del@@ ete . thus , you now have a scene without objects .
the wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
the object tree now contains a new entry called Camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the User Docum@@ entation to &amp; Po@@ v@@ ray , you will find further details .
change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera in view has check@@ points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired location .
when pressing the button or pressing the button , the wi@@ re@@ piece views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the point of view of the camera .
there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could , for example , insert a box ( insert final body boxes ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler option . you can use an infinite plane as the ground :
a good advice : select the layer in the object tree , change the name and then press the user button or the Enter key . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately .
the wire model view now also displays the level , al@@ beit at the moment only as a limited fin@@ ite plane . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon .
when you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the ground if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties .
in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , only to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows :
first select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but at the moment select something simple .
in both cases a dialog opens , where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select First Sub@@ ject . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can view the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the Pre@@ view button you see how the pigment is now .
of course , the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment . therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview .
if you don &apos;t see any color on the box and ball in the preview , click the App@@ ly button and then get the preview .
the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you now render your picture with a click on the icon , you should get the following result :
of course , this is not the color you expected . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the object tree you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more often , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) :
in the object tree , select mon@@ ochro@@ me and change colors in the object properties view :
this step should already be done simply because you should have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the ball can be created just as easy as the ground :
in the view of property properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget to press the Enter key or button Appl@@ ying ) , so the ball has contact with the floor . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit down@@ wards .
of course the rendering results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . in the next step , put a suitable material .
if you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already at the bottom , give the ball a pigment as a color :
select First Sub@@ ject and change the name for example in ball Pig@@ ment . click Ball Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows :
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press Enter .
the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection partly result in good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected :
you should now have a good impression of what options you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er offers ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes .
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model .
when you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hypo@@ the@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) by every pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect .
as you can imagine , you will not see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene needs to be rendered , some light sources and at least one camera .
in the usual file dialog you can select your file . Po@@ v@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c .
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list .
if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you will need to enter a name and a disk space .
re@@ stores the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are disc@@ arded .
this menu entry allows you to select only if you still have un@@ saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used editing .
stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing arrangement .
in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here you can change the look , keyboard short@@ cuts and default behavior .
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands introduced with this option for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; change commands or add new ones .
opens a dialog to set up the toolbar . with this option , you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
a b@@ ump map is a way to design rough surfaces without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself .
it is common to use the same file for a b@@ ump map as well as for a texture map .
basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic parts . these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance .
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display .
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
you can specify whether any image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window .
if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right lower corner . if a suitable file name is found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c .
in the dialog In@@ sert - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five cards . in three of them , General and Edi@@ ting and Sli@@ deshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be set for the respective windows .
if this is selected , the images will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not large enough to fill out the screen , the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode .
if this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for a slide show .
with this option stores &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when moving the name of the last opened folder . at the next start &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
click on the colored bar to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if the window is larger than the image in the window mode , the background will be filled with the selected color .
you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set up just some of the file types that the program can also display .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
the time span between the image change in a slide show . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 3 seconds .
the number of repeti@@ tions . if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows to the right next to the input field . default is 1 .
change the short@@ cuts for the different operating modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show here ; in the box cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
this option enables you to switch between two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window .
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short display .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; will also be closed when no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is enabled .
opens the input field for completion . enter the first characters of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on &amp; digi@@ plug ; image editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the digi@@ plug ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful basic tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform corrections and changes .
like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to contribute to at least problems and possible improvements .
&amp; show@@ photo ; makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . if you are in the program , the menu provides an entry to reports problems or desires . this displays a dialog with a link . if you use it , your browser will open a page for reports of problems and wishes . all the information you need is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo , then we would like to ask you questions about other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mailing list , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language .
the best start to participate in &amp; show@@ photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list join . instructions to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; .
&amp; show@@ photo ; tries to give you so much control over its work@@ flows as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to access these settings , you need to select show foto in the Settings menu . the settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side .
in the exposure indicators section you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should contrast the colors with what you are supposed to display . under@@ exposure should display a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark colour .
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also view the same side bar in image editing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five tab :
&amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning of images that do not do more than scan and save images .
&amp; Ch@@ ann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning of images that no longer makes them scan and save as images . can open a dialog for saving each picture or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving them .
you can check the status of your scanner &apos;s support on the SA@@ NE project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; chann@@ l@@ ite ; using the command Ch@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened .
the user can select the scanner you need to use and press OK to open the scanner . Cancel will stop .
the other settings do not contain more detailed options of the driver . ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) these options are not particularly addressed .
to scan an image , the user can only start a scan scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button .
in order to better select the image , the user can zoom in into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also adjust the zoom in such a way that the full preview will fit in the window .
if the image has been selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
if you preview a preview in the settings before saving , then the image will appear in a preview window , as shown below . when saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie ? en leads to a demoli@@ tion and you get back to the main window .
the Settings button opens the same name dialog in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
the user can view the image if desired , before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected .
this setting allows you to select the type as &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; images store . open dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before any scann@@ ed image . if &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; this will automatically store with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without asking for a filen@@ ame .
this setting defines where the images are saved with the Save option without asking for a file name . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ...
this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the image automatically to be saved and is also the suggested name for the image in the Save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded every time a picture is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers .
the user can adjust the image quality used for saving . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used .
the Help button starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Ch@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button About starts the K@@ DE over dialog for &amp; sc@@ l@@ ite ; The button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; channel .

&amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses like all other programs keyboard short@@ cuts . below you can set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global key short@@ cuts you can set up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select Global keyboard short@@ cuts ... by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and select short@@ cuts ... Select .
you may set existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this allows you to make your keyboard to the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Centre .
the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions , which are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts .
Amar@@ ok supports the command line options of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some command @-@ line options .
you should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependen@@ cy . please check in your script to see if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog to help the user know why a script does not run .
begin require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE bin@@ dings for ruby ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; &apos; exit end
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should be included in any K@@ DE installation .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . for this purpose , the function ex@@ ec ( ) is usually used . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this reason , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore events even if it has no use for it .
configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and store the setup data each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok will put the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved .
track@@ Change : track@@ Change shows that a new piece is played . the script could now be retri@@ eved with D@@ CO@@ P functions for more information about the new piece ( for example , the metadata or the length of the piece ) .
Volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume Sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le adds the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry is cli@@ cked . to add an entry you can use the D@@ CO@@ P function d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) . to remove an entry you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Item ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M signal to the script . this signal should be processed to perform cleaning operations , such as storing data or configuration settings .
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages which the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally also be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . we recommend an archive name such as e.g. mein@@ scrip@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ scrip@@ t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amar@@ ok script package .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the exhaus@@ tion amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should name your script packages right away .
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file permissions :
if your script package is ready , you can upload it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and still surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . perhaps you also search for a quite specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s collection browser and quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still hard , the dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria .
Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers if@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to hear your music . these and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right thing to re@@ discover your music !
usually you have to enter the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok :
there &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , there are some options that can be activated or de@@ activated at compile time with the configure script . this is a list of available options .
for some of the compile @-@ options certain dependen@@ cies need to be fulfilled so that they can be used . for details please refer to the System Requirements section .
activating debu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without any effort on the setup dialog . the setup dialog has multiple flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed .
use V@@ oting bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for mo@@ od@@ bar . this changes the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
store mood files in the music files : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for mo@@ od@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / mo@@ od@@ bar / ) .
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is needed .
using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
save playlist when loading , save the current playlist when moving from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when moving .
relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored .
keep the current piece visible when changing the piece , so that the play@@ lists window will roll / off to keep the current piece always in the visible window area .
when changing to the context browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
in the App@@ ear@@ ance section you can customize the look and feel of Amar@@ ok . the section is divided into three parts .
in the font section you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set . by selecting own writings the otherwise grey displayed section is enabled . you can select typ@@ ef@@ aces for the following area : playlist window , player window and context browser . click Select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog .
with selecting Custom color scheme , you yourself have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . to do so , use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color .
continue playback when starting , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , continue playback automatically with the piece on the spot with which it has been stopped at the last stop .
the On @-@ Screen Display sub@@ window allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is attached , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly .
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select the desired font for the O@@ SD from the dialog . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
your own colors will give you the option to customize the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if your own colors are not activated , the default colors will be used .
the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering plac@@ eholders the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below is a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean .
the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment should be the O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate even more settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection , including the folder and type of the database for the collection .
here you can select the folder , the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . this section also includes check boxes for setting up as with the selected folders .
Browse sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the selected as well as their sub@@ folders are searched for music .
monitor changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; add all the found play@@ lists to your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
the component collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , further setup is necessary in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under calcul@@ ator : will enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established .
use user name : and password : to enter the data needed to connect to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card card provides support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece if required .
here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website .
send dra@@ ined pieces and update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
retrieve similar interpre@@ ts : after activating this setting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; takes some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
some functions such as the O@@ SD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .org . Gn@@ ome will work , for example , but flu@@ x@@ box will work hard . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment .
probably one of your files will cause an error in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library for days . you can locate the file by looking at ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
it is mostly because Tag@@ li@@ b cras@@ hes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature .
make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ x was compiled , then this leads to cras@@ hes when editing the met@@ a information .
if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then de@@ activate automatically . switch off if in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second .
you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail will open automatically in case of a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be corrected .
this is because many programs write data as U@@ TF @-@ 8 into the met@@ a @-@ Infos , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script resol@@ ves the problem .
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; does not exist &quot; unless -@@ f $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; Error by writing the tags from $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; unless $ mp@@ 3 &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; U@@ TF@@ 8 ) ;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes the symbol effects are easily forgotten . in some cases , you have to click on a symbol for up to three times until this setting shows its effect .
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : amar@@ o@@ app : un@@ defined symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map , then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
to fix this error , you may need to remove any conflic@@ ting Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first .
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily solved by using an expert for your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help from other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ o@@ de@@ .net in channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please insert only one error if you have something to fix an error in Amar@@ ok yourself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only an empty playlist appears . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files into the right part of the playlist .
to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub @-@ window was converted to the Statistics window . you can find it under Extras statistics .
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for rating by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
to evaluate pieces , the review column must be displayed in the playlist . click anywhere in the new review column to specify the rating for one piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background .
select the files you want to remove and then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select From playlist Remove From the drop @-@ down menu .
drag a playlist file with your mouse into the playlist and drop it down there just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - )
in the toolbar of the playlist , right next to the Add button , the playlist will be saved . click on it .
probably missing the program x@@ mm@@ s @-@ config . install the x@@ mm@@ s @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . also look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
no . yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , therefore the actual question must be What media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and PNG !
it may ! maybe use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 deco@@ ders are included in the default ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 , Enter key
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s : - )
if you are using the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously generate audio . this can be achieved by using a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( Software mixer ) .
the output of this command should help you in finding the cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ se@@ sink ) .
you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just listen to a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS .
also X@@ M@@ MS deco@@ ders the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine .
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer Driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ ori@@ ety ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper SU@@ ID is set :
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multi @-@ co@@ de@@ cs which can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . the magni@@ fication of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
either you don &apos;t use the Arts Driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) .
probably use the Arts Driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been heavily optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dre@@ gs respond to the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; why ?
after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . run @-@ register to register all the G@@ Stre@@ amer components .
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer .
try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder from G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with the recently @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run the recently @-@ register . now start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
please report them under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of suggestions / wishes , please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I really like it and find that the name sounds good . in addition , the name contains the magic K ... : )
thanks to D@@ CO@@ P this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play
this command lets you start playing Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will wake up from the soft tones of music that you have stopped prior to bed .
how to get the current title in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you are on another computer ?
if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying
replace IP address with your IP and username with your username . this assumes that your identification is in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ r@@ sa file .
the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; window . to do so , press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size .
the combination of C@@ trl + right mouse button creates a piece in the queu@@ e sequence . by pressing the Enter key after a search in the playlist , the first search result will be played and the search returned .
OK , the player window and playlist have tri@@ cky functions , but how does the icon in the system section of the Control Panel look like ?
click the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browsers to display .
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console appear many error messages . what now ?
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive , or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
insert the CD , then click Play Audio CD in the menu . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . to the normal read , switch to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic coding , instead take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g .
Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escaped string ( ur@@ l ) ) ;
basically this adjust@@ s the previous assessment with a decreasing value based on how often the piece has been played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result .
you can enter the evaluation for a piece yourself by right @-@ clicking on a column header in the playlist window . then you can change the evaluation of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select evaluation or press F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the Metad@@ ata dialog .
the developers do not want you to tell you when you want to release a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the scheduled plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok , which some users can also find annoying . disable the option icon when playing animated in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the toolbar . select Settings Tool@@ bars Set up ... and take the desired changes there .
download a design , or create your own . install it then under Amar@@ ok ... App@@ ear@@ ance Con@@ text Browser Design , click New Design to install ....
the symbol was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) . to avoid difficulties , it was removed .
Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation range allows you to monitor and control Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to display the navigation area . then click the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop down menu .
the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and password . audio osc@@ ale is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok .
if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of cras@@ hes and a lot of error reports .
probably , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine did not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; newly installed , but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
you will need to install the package G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install Amar@@ ok ; again , you have to install and install Amar@@ ok .
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How do I fix it ?
your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you have to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without p@@ rel@@ inking . a tip from mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when comp@@ iling Amar@@ ok .
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 , although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
in order to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad .
you get the error there is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok .
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use Amar@@ ok to use the second sound card ?
set up under settings Amar@@ ok ... Audio output will give you the device . typically , e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here you can see an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
pc@@ m.@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } pc@@ m.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } c@@ tl@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
in the setup dialog of x@@ ine , enter us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on ) .
if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , de@@ activate the tick on sound card supports m@@ map .
we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts will not continue to be looked after . of course you are allowed to take this problem by hand ! if you would like , you can get the new so much @-@ needed supervis@@ or for Arts : )
listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup assistant , which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to update your collection later , or just do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes .
creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser into the playlist . if you are satisfied with the playlist , the tree view will only store the remaining matching entries . if you are satisfied with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist . you will find this button in the toolbar of the playlist window .
if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in your collection , and you have enabled the playlist to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . with a right click on a playlist , you will find various ways to load the playlist .
to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play button .
the Audio CD function uses the audio cd protocol : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Burn menu . you have here different ways to burn a CD .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed which make the work done with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more enjoyable .
if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages !
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a multi @-@ sided multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . as any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to all others .
in this chapter , it explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist .
the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Control Center . at the top of the window is a scroll display showing the current piece or current stream . just below it is the range , the game time , bit rate and sample rate of the current piece . one click on this area changes the display of the already expi@@ red season to the remaining game time of the piece .
in addition , the player window includes a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the scroll display . you can change through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area .
the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , exten@@ sible window .
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also included under the balance sheet . the PL button activates or de@@ activates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to set equ@@ ali@@ zers .
the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the play position sli@@ der . use the sli@@ ders to set the piece position or volume . with the playback buttons , you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece .
the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own preferences .
to view the E@@ quali@@ zer , use Extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the check box E@@ quali@@ zer , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
the Play@@ list of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist for all &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that there is no other player . but don &apos;t let the abundance of functions deter you , they are all easy to use .
the play@@ lists window can be divided into two main areas , on the left hand side of the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist , such as the context browser . on the right is the playlist itself . the playlist is easy to use and even for advanced users powerful enough .
the context @-@ browser shows different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted using context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub @-@ windows : music , text and interpreter . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail .
if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you might notice that the sub @-@ window has dropped off . the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok . in addition , the information can be viewed in the statistics window ( Extras statistics ) .
the music sub @-@ window displays information about the currently running track , as well as the interpreter and the album .
the first section in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title there is the name of the piece , artist and the album . below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to check the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database .
you can find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
to view cover pictures in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . the file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
the next section , Recommen@@ ded Pi@@ ec@@ es , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will play immediately .
among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter . this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . to do so , right click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
the last section , albums of the interpreter , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album .
you can click all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately . you can also right @-@ click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
in the sub@@ window , the downloaded text is displayed for the current piece . this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self @-@ written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the internet . if no text script is running , you can choose which to start .
the Edit button allows you to edit the song text . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
group Interpre@@ t - group@@ ed only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter . albums or genres are ignored .
group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further division will be made according to the respective album . if you want to see combinations or sound@@ track albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Differ@@ ent Artists .
group Artist / Year - Album - Sor@@ ted by Interpre@@ t and then after the year of the album in descending order ( latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related .
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabe@@ tically by each other . the interpreter is ignored .
group@@ ing genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by interpreter .
group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter .
with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will .
with the last button you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders . if you own many pieces , this could take a while .
a search filter is located directly under the toolbar . it beha@@ ves in the list view as well as in the tree view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual .
below the search filter is a selection box with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection . you can select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . in addition , you can also select your total collection , making the filter practically shut off .
by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following possibilities .
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces to the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect .
set pieces in queu@@ e - This function adds the selected pieces to the queu@@ e . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved .
transfer the pieces to the Media Player - Add the pieces to the Media Player . see the Media @-@ Player Browser section for more details .
burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and burned either as a data or an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed .
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Open the dialog for item information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
( s ) Move files to the garbage bin ... - Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer .
select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under different interpre@@ ters .
set up a compilation selection - Modi@@ fies an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album . afterwards , the album is no longer displayed under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpreter .
the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to deal with many play@@ lists . among other things , it also includes intelligent play@@ lists .
the bottom part of the play@@ lists browser contains the smart play@@ lists . they use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists for runtime . the smart play@@ lists are composed of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played .
even created smart play@@ lists are possible . click on Add Intelligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist .
the Media Player sub @-@ window is used for connection of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser .
to transfer songs to your iPod , drag the required titles from the playlist and drop them to the list Interpre@@ t . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod . if the transfer is finished , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and lo@@ osen the drive engagement for your iPod .
the toolbar contains a search area with which you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files that do not match your search criteria .
in the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can fet@@ ch music from a entered URL . if you enter tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press Enter , you can access music in the musi@@ c@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z file . now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist .
if the playlist is longer than in the window , the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping . in that case , holding down the Shift key can be helpful . by doing so , dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position .
the playlist contains all pieces attached to play . you can change the order by simply drag the entries into the desired location by using the mouse . once you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button for a long time until the text field is empty again .
if you enter search terms separated by spaces , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries that contain all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two , the search will find all entries that contain one , two , and three .
if you enter OR between the search terms OR , search for entries that contain either one or the other search term . for example , one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) .
if you want to search for entries that contain spaces , then en@@ close the search term with ge@@ ese feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that Mike Old@@ field contain , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field .
if you specify a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : evaluation : &gt; 50 . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 .
if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything .
you can combine these syntax variations with each other at will . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this is looking for all pieces that have either Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
you can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the C@@ trl key , and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries . entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played .
the toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist . on the left hand side , you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . to the right of the playlist you will find a playlist , empty playlist and random mixing .
next , the buttons will follow back and restore . this allows you to rever@@ t or restore changes to the playlist .
in the middle of the toolbar is a unique , magni@@ fying analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer .
the last button in the toolbar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button . over this menu you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
there are many more available buttons for the toolbar , for example , playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on menu and setting up toolbar ... Select .
the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it shows the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking twice in the appropriate display area with the mouse .
you can also hide the status bar . to do so , disable the status bar option in the General Settings .
the context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist . through this menu you can reach the settings of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
a click on this entry opens the visualization plug @-@ in window . there you can select the visu@@ alis@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover management is a useful tool to manage your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in your collection browser .
the cover management contains list view of all the albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an interpreter in your collection by selecting the artist on the left .
with the View menu , you can choose what should be displayed in the cover management . select from :
the queu@@ e administration received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you set a piece into the queu@@ e , the playlist will display a number next to the title . this number represents the order , in der &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 will play first , 2 as second , and so on .
the queu@@ e management can be used to open the queu@@ e . if you want to add a piece to the queu@@ e , select the item in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces to the playlist or use the context menu in the playlist . the order of the pieces can then be changed in the queu@@ e administration .
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these later ) .
fills your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and adds further random pieces while playing .
add pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio osc@@ ale ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a load .@@ f@@ m profile to make this dynamic playlist work .
double click the playlist you want , drag it to the playlist window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Load . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new playlist .
the two pre @-@ set Mo@@ di Rand@@ om Mix and Play@@ lists mix immediately fill your playlist and you can start playback directly . the Play@@ list Recommen@@ ded pieces start with an empty playlist and you have to add at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will be filled only at the end of the first piece .
if you want to keep the current playlist , enable the last possible dynamic mode : dynamic Mode settings . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated using the same menu entry .
the Neu button cle@@ ars the current playlist and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . editing the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings .
right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist gives you the option to click Edit . then the dialog opens to edit the playlist settings .
enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique in order to avoid confusion .
if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and you will not hear a piece twice in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the already played pieces will be removed with attention to the setting songs .
played pieces - this is the number of played pieces to be kept at the beginning of the playlist . this allows you to easily see which pieces have been played recently .
this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist by each piece of play . if you set more than 1 , the playlist will continue to grow , because only one piece can be played and removed .
the settings on the right are already described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select from already existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you tick several play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the selected play@@ lists .
some scripts make your own settings possible . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then clicking on .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . after you have installed the script , a new entry will appear in the list . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also use the More Scrip@@ ts button .
if you do not want to use a script any longer , you can delete it . then select the script to be deleted then click Un@@ install .
if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please refer to the section Write the Scrip@@ ts section .
the dialog window visu@@ alisation plug@@ ins is used to activate available visu@@ alis@@ ations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plug@@ ins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name .
this Quick Start will show you how to create an audio CD with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; in four steps you need to create an audio CD . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files .
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
if you want to burn an audio CD from MP3 s or other loss@@ less compressed formats then remember that when you re @-@ encoding to MP3 , you will get a better quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD has been created by a loss@@ less format .
in this dialog you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has completed the burning process .
this Quick Start will show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ ROM drive .
to copy a data CD , please select Extras , Copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning .
after you have made all the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , please press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this :
in this dialog box you can follow the progress of the copy process . once you have finished reading the original into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Burn the image file . you now have to wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet , such programs are commonly referred to as ri@@ pper .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology and for dealing with audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis profits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis Decoder and Enco@@ der modules .
M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module .
l@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by MP3 encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for loss@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio encoder module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : other libraries for processing different audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG , it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them to an audio CD . de@@ co
SO@@ X : an auxiliary program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio Enco@@ der module .
Trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video processing . you will need it when you want to read a DVD .
V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs .
norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently lou@@ dly .
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project .
save the current project . if the project has been saved already , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name .
save the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save is displayed with which you can choose folders and file name for the project file .
stores all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving .
closes the current project . if a project has been modified and not yet saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what has to happen . you can then choose to disc@@ ard between saving and changes . you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open .
closes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any un@@ saved project what to do with it , just as if you would have called for each project file .
closes all opened projects and ends &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each not saved project will be asked what to do with it , as if you would have called file closing .
when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project using the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as if you view the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD .
open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button Burn , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data .
opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described by the What is the ? -@@ help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful if you do not use files for a multi @-@ session CD . the data of the previous session are always included , even if this function is not used . it is intended for you rather than help , so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , it only bl@@ ends the previously imported files .
this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also create a copy of a CD which you can burn later . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs .
this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a DVD , which you can burn later on . also , there is also the possibility of cl@@ oning instead of normal copying . therefore , the target medium must be large enough to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form .
opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD @-@ RW .
opens the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , allowing the content to be completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes and incre@@ mental .
the dialog will prompt you for a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . )
burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog will ask you for a * .@@ is@@ o file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button .
a previously loaded DVD video can be converted . this dialog box will typically help you to read a DVD in the table view , but can also be used alone . it contains information about the selected video , encoding settings , and even ways to change the size and cut off black edges .
displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium such as size and title length of the CD or DVD .
displays a list of toolbar of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is selected , the toolbar is currently visible in the main window .
if this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is hidden .
the folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents will be shown in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locks and unlock the drive or ej@@ ecting the media .
the Content View allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the table of contents is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view .
the head bar is a narrow area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head bar has no real function , it only looks nice and separates the project view from the rest of the views .
this opens a dialog box for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can customize the key assignment below .
this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; Setup Wizard . thus , the correct permissions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs . for this , system administrator rights are required , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard .
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and fine adjustment of the program .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled , for example , by a shell script .
to use the d@@ CO@@ P &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the range of functions , so your taste and type of task is crucial , which of the enclosed programs you give preference .
in this chapter we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console :
in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that have common all &amp; k@@ de ; program commonly supported , &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below .
the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format DVD and other functions for creating new projects .
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Video@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) void dup@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) void bur@@ n@@ C@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( ) void Bur@@ n@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project using the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then receive a reference to the project via # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project .
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface , which is only applicable to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ string parent ) void add@@ Ur@@ ls ( Q@@ string path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ Item ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id )
thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then add files to the new folder :
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data@@ CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der
&amp; k@@ audio Creator ; is an audio CD ; sel@@ ector for &amp; k@@ de ; with it you can easily record audio CD ; s out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible depending on encoder installed on the computer .
&amp; k@@ audio Creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and by many coding files that enco@@ ded these WAV files . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs and FLA@@ C ( loss@@ less compression ) are currently supported . more enco@@ ders may be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
first the titles of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( loss@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
in a second step these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as loss@@ less FLA@@ C .
for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , it is used by &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this has to be done now .
for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ able ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distri@@ butions , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself . however , if not used , for example , FLA@@ C is not required .
which encoding / file format is to be used ? chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer is a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors .
a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audio creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device circum@@ vents the protection , it is not possible to read the mechanisms of copy protection . just avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s !
while setting up only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; explained on the hard disk . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the slim approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning .
convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; )
can &amp; CD ; fet@@ ch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is recorded manually .
this is just a short list of the commands of the main window . on the page step by step example , you will find more information about how this program is used and screen shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for configuration of the program .
starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this may be local or online , in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established . )
starts reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so the selection with a different encoder can be read as the standard . it should be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog .
opens the File Manager , allowing an already selected file to be selected instead of a full &amp; CD ; read and encoding .
opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , sp@@ ades ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ating ) .
opens the main setup dialog of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; with different card cards ( such as encoder , for setting the encoder ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used !
this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding .
if no audio information is to be lost , a loss@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files .
the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acousti@@ cal model are MP3 and O@@ GG . O@@ GG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but the differences are less important because both enco@@ ders generate very good audio quality .
O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless supplied with most distri@@ butions for free , but there are open license questions
+ high to very high sound quality ( with high bit rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly lower quality with deeper bit rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few O@@ GG back@@ ups is present .
MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stereo systems . today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format .
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . requires always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality .
&apos;@@ -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR Joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good enough for music of you@@ ths , portable devices and aut@@ oster@@ e@@ o@@ anlagen . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting .
the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or retri@@ eved by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / used with &amp; k@@ audio creator ; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the coding explain the switches for these programs .
for example to add the CD ; add title to the keywords ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t must be added by l@@ ame and the title Paramet@@ ers of &amp; k@@ audio Creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
this is what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs , which can download information instead of entering the computer . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , Artist , N@@ ames of the pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself .
yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) I am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; there is no more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt . all information can be obtained anyway at a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual .
in &amp; k@@ audio creator ; is active to select a check box ( sending an address ) . for the use of fre@@ ed@@ b can be used with another ( fake ) address as the one in the system . in this type of configuration , it seems that the email address is not used by the server ( This may only know the programmer who checked the code . )
there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audio creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , ge@@ ographi@@ cally the closest mirr@@ ored server should be used . this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts .
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information while reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively , the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only updates of the database .
which reading program is used to save pieces from the CD ; to save in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who you want to know more accurately , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see Note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed , if this has not happened yet .
to save the read files read , the enco@@ ders and thus the desired file format can be selected . the first opening contains pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss@@ less compression for audio data ) on the encoding tab . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab .
the encoder package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined codes . more information about enco@@ ders can be found in the section Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
after installing a encoder , further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder .
this can have many causes . check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD disk , the writing and reading rights on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed .
check if you do not want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
there is one chapter with one step by step example . even if you are using other settings , you can give tips on how to proceed .
have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want .
in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V1 head@@ words ( tags ) .
you need to have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine as it is considered not entirely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do .
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to copy it ( eg by trying to copy something inside it ) .
the first section covers the basic setting up of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; something that will probably only be done once and
the second section describes how to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD .
here we determine the code used to compression music ( l@@ ame ) and audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy , we share the program to use the fre@@ ed@@ b to download data from the internet .
although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it at any read @-@ out of a &amp; CD ; change once the appropriate settings are found .
the device name will be handed over to the reading program to read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD @-@ ROM and / or DVD drives helps .
the tab General Settings . here is not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
only select queries in case of incomplete information so that you will be informed when information on the creation of keywords ( tags ) is missing .
simply select both entries . we are comfortable and allow the &amp; CD ; data can be automatically downloaded via the internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the &amp; CD , so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
the second drop @-@ down box is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry found starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; this is associated with low risk if you are later un@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filen@@ ame resulting from it , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; tag@@ ger .
apart from this example , keep in mind : if you want to manually enter everything manually , de@@ activate the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , if you download the database beforehand . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first one .
CD@@ DB is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the section on fre@@ ed@@ b .
mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server .
CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to the fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org site and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt .
both work equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls bo@@ unce the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet .
in this example we do not want any &amp; CD ; send data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . disable the first check box .
just take the settings from the screen shot . ( make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer )
number of simultaneously dischar@@ ging pieces : sorry , there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know , therefore simply try himself .
CD ; disc@@ ard after reading the last piece : check this for the &amp; CD ; disc@@ ard it at the end of the process .
user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the WAV files .
enter everything as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be fl@@ atten@@ ed to the right to see everything .
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good HiFi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is about 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption .
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside this example :
number of simultaneously enco@@ ded WAV files : with a Du@@ al@@ core or Quad Core or even a multi@@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time .
that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again .
in this section it describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music on the hard disk is organized , was described in the previous section . first , a connection to the Internet is built , since we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b .
since we use a CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data obtained for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually enter data instead of extrac@@ ting it from the Internet . comments will point to the differences .
do not try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
if this has not happened yet , then the &amp; CD must now be pushed into the drive defined in the main window .
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this is only when the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; can be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
if this does not happen , then search in the Questions and Ans@@ wers section after the Help or go back to the previous section on basic settings .
attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album is displayed .
in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; there is a window displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; matches .
if you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for the settings ) , you can also trigger it manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but fet@@ ch the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet .
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece
enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first row of the text &apos; current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; .
the artist no longer needs to be entered in the &quot; current title &quot; input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for individual comments of the individual comments per piece , the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD .
attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments .
note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audio creator ; this option is set on the encoding settings tab .
you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags .
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders and file formats . see Help for the encoder to get more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the download@@ able CD ; in this example , this is not important because we do not transmit the CD ; for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or R@@ ap for example are found under Rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
the window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the toolbar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list .
note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles that are so marked are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece , or press the All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once .
was started by clicking on the selection process read out the read process , then this window will appear for confirmation . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens .
click on the tab assignments to switch to the job window . it is in the left upper half of the window , right under the buttons of the toolbar .
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is read just on the hard drive . the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status line .
you will see this error message if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully deco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - )
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
the assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and encoding in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved .
the author of the program has not found a configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding . in case of weak machines , the result is uncle@@ ar . the computer with an AM@@ D@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpretation and encoding ( from however two different pieces ) .
now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queu@@ e of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window .
for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audio creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the encoder of your choice .
if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions , however , already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audio creator ; a part of an important bundle . if you read this , you probably already did ...
this section is directed to persons compiled from source files and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution .
if you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is right for you :
a program that calls many different programs has many different settings . it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example .
hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first time of the program , without any clu@@ e how to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ?
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audio creator ; may it do . at least after contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agre@@ eing to this suggestion .
strange when you &apos;ve managed to get the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need these information , but ...
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MI@@ DI@@ - and Kar@@ aoke player of &amp; k@@ de ; in addition to others , it also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke live up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment of texts that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ul@@ tras@@ ound project driver , which is needed for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer .
&amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece .
graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows can drag to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards in order to save text into MIDI files ( real estate events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the method used .
session support . when you finish &amp; k@@ de while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time .
supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) .
first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid ; Window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
to play a piece of music , open it and press the button playback in the toolbar , select the entry Cancel from the menu item or press the space bar .
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece will automatically start as soon as you move it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller .
if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed . in order to get the original tempo , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD .
the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or the selection of the menu entry pause in the menu piece , thus interrup@@ ts playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback .
lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics , and others both . some pieces don &apos;t have any lyrics at all : - )
in &amp; k@@ mid , you can set what events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event will be automatically determined , which a song uses , so that you do not need to manually adjust it . so if you activate the Auto Text option in the Settings menu , the kar@@ aoke text will be automatically selected .
if you want to set an event type , select the entries in the Settings menu from the Settings menu . the same function has the keys 1 and 2 .
a collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played back in series . in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently .
to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize .... click New and enter the name for the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original collection .
if you have more than one collection , you can set the respective prizes in the collection manager .
the temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
when leaving the application , this collection will not be saved . remember that if you add a lot of pieces .
to add songs to a collection , it has to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add a song . it again appears the file dialog with which you can select the song you want .
a second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Ad@@ dition to the collection .
when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Drag &amp; Drop ) .
if automatic add to the collection is not checked , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the pieces opened .
to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove .
you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu of the menu item , the songs will play in the order as they were added to the collection .
if you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined .
to play a song , select it from the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text .
to skip a song , select the Next Song button , the post next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right .
to jump vice versa a song , select the Pre@@ ferences button , previous item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left .
to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button .
the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ;
this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers who are not General MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands .
for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano into events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and lets you sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play .
if you have just one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US charts , FM devices and so on ) .
unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from your hand ( using your favorite editor ) .
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary translations for playing a piece .
each section may appear only once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) .
def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Ano@@ ther Key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine Key@@ map ... EN@@ D OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ... EN@@ D
you see that Def@@ ine is needed to indicate that a section will start ( except for OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as an e @-@ mail , so that I can offer support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general usage is as follows :
please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments .
the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is used to set all sounds that this instrument requires to play on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) which sounds similar to a gun .
so if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( gun shot ) , it takes Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file .
please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument ( drums , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) .
the key@@ map section is used to specify how tones are shown on a particular channel or instrument .
as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries .
you can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key maps are used above all to map tones to the percussion channel . take a look at the included key@@ maps .
this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to swa@@ p the first and second channel , just do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section .
however , these settings are more useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) .
MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern :
n is the channel , which is displayed on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the Key@@ map is used with the name Name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored which will try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is always used .
the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel .
the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ nam@@ ing event with the value n , it is converted to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used to prevent dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as in the map file .
this setting is needed because GM pre@@ tends that a keyboard , which is supposed to play a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 , is supposed to play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you must try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid ; try it .
to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find this in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings .
the channel view is a window with a full range of key@@ boards ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are currently being played .
you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used .
the channel view ( until now ) has two different views to display the played notes . in the Settings menu , select Settings from the point channel view : settings
the speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed .
so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows left and right from the LCD .
a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; thus , the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices , just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways .
good , I can &apos;t force anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; to use . but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , the speed and etc ; you have control over everything .
this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page )
I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I have no desire to add all files separately .
agree to support &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all the files and drag them to &amp; k@@ mid ; Window .
in advance , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection .
you can press the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down playback . to restore the default speed , you can double @-@ click on the LCD .
I have a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or attached ( if I play a kar@@ aoke file ) . in this way , if the collection is played at the end or I want to play a file , just switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
if you want to listen to a file just once , without adding it to a collection , turn off the Automati@@ cally Add to the collection , and the new ; file is added to the temporary collection . opening files
let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . First you just want to play the first file . so adjust the setting Automati@@ cally add to the collection and open A.@@ Schmidt . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file .
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I am in the third year , so I do not have much leisure time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time . as a hob@@ bies I have program , collect MIDI files , make music and pro@@ positions .
if you would like to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es
if you send me a postcard or a mi@@ di / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file I will record among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; but before you send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might already have the file .
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; completely written in my spare time and by no one gets money for it . I would like to emphasize that I only continue to program@@ mati@@ cally because / when I receive feedback from users ( post@@ cards or e @-@ mails ) .
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AW@@ E cards was too high .
my thanks also apply to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the G@@ US support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ thei@@ der , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error message or just a supporting email .
and of course , my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MI@@ DI@@ - and kar@@ aoke files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , search for information and view pictures . you will also find links to sites with other kar@@ aoke songs , etc ;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card . it is not the same if you use an FM radio or an AW@@ E card .
if you do not have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL , it will then run as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear music of course .
if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me .
&amp; S@@ ME ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files of formats supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on , and to play DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera .

the application window is made of so @-@ called do@@ cking windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned .
it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ mark menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Perman@@ ent playlist .
of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level . if you have an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry .
the categories &apos; current pieces &apos; , TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files . of course you can only do that if &amp; S@@ ME ; not running . just click on a name of a category cli@@ cken , select from the View menu and next edit mode . by clicking a sub@@ group only the XML content of this part is displayed .
after changing XML files , you need to select the playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category .
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist .
as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; S@@ ME , some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files .
the animation when starting and moving can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; S@@ ME ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ ME / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / S@@ ME / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
the animation during startup does not need to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , the user can therefore quit the application a second time .
a simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; mim@@ ic ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ;
there is a tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; here you can set the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the toolbar of S@@ ME . here is the output of m@@ player .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c like setting up the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example of how a &apos; flash &apos; is played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played inside &amp; S@@ ME ; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
in order for the S@@ MB player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; S@@ ME needs to be specified as a service provider for the M@@ ime @-@ type application / x @-@ shock@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file mapping of K@@ DE .
the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; S@@ ME ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end output is within &amp; S@@ ME . ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) .
to ensure that a pre @-@ existing back@@ end is always taken for a specific M@@ ime type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , it must be done by manual modification of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , it should play all og@@ g files :
&amp; S@@ ME ; can be played by TV cards , either by means of a M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be seen , the device to use and the TV channels must be configured . to do so , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually .
to configure the V@@ DR ( Video data recorder ) settings in the S@@ MB player , the dialog in Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be used . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably contains a dv@@ b in it .
since V@@ DR support from S@@ ME@@ s can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video for@@ lin@@ ux extension for the X server must be functional . for this reason , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig )
this documentation uses dv@@ d@@ na@@ v@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , source , intro@@ source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . when activated , they start playing the playlist .
are there any references to how I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command is run as root after mounting the device . it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom displays on the CD@@ ROM drive .
x@@ ine starts only slowly , why must my CPU be tested for performance every time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hau@@ led . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player will automatically need the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU .

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; K@@ ile .
latex ; : a professional typ@@ ef@@ ace application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be applied to the package &amp; tex@@ tual ; and / tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components may be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for the installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; K@@ ile ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; K@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . they allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included in the tile ; web page .
this manual is for everyone - independent of experiences with &amp; latex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; K@@ ile ; or &amp; Linux ; .
advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact over the tile should be made .
if you have any questions about the compilation of &amp; K@@ ile , or if extensions are requested , this should be addressed to the mailing list K@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&amp; K@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; latex ; environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; K@@ ile ; provides the ability to use all &amp; latex ; functions in a graphical interface and within it provides easy , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; latex .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its possibilities to learn should be used the manual for K@@ ate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly by reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
for &amp; latex ; is the correct language : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . while the original language is difficult to use , a lay@@ man ( lay ) &amp; latex can also be used ; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it deri@@ ves from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port@@ .
while here only a good natural view to &amp; latex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to be used . for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; latex should be used ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 .
the introduction contains at least the command \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ end { document } .
the Quick entry Wizard of &amp; K@@ ile ; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document . you can also make some settings related to the document .
document classes : this introduces the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , cover &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , book ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user defined .
encoding : with this the character encoding of the system is set . modern systems increasingly use the U@@ TF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best U@@ TF @-@ 8@@ X should be chosen ( for correct processing of the &amp; latex ; documents ) .
this list contains the most frequently used add @-@ on packages for &amp; latex ; for inclusion , they only need to be selected in the check box .
article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always find use when creating German texts .
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it &apos;s just a short description of the functions and further information on this is given in the section .
&amp; K@@ ile ; offers - as well as other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen , it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed . however , it is due to the modest appearance of the output file .
with the automatic completion of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically creates a blank line ( for entering the text ) and the corresponding line for closing the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) .
all documents are normally divided into some elements . &amp; latex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document to be divided into the following elements ( part is the most basic and subtle the bottom element ) :
in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse .
when creating your own &amp; latex ; files can be very helpful when creating your own file . once a DVI file has been created ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ bsp file ) &#93; , jumps &amp; K@@ ile ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; latex ; source text .
a DVI ; file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; There are many tools to view , convert and to print DVI ; files for various systems and devices .
when using the text search , the elements of the DVI @-@ file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked into the DVI ; source code is the exact opposite of it . once cli@@ cked on a section in &amp; latex ; source text is cli@@ cked to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer .
master document : this function is used when working with multiple files . with a master document the work with other involved .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted to project project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; latex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI file is read on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are unused &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and there is no call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , after quick mounting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when viewing the Edit toolbar , the three large selection boxes should be noticed . the selection fields were developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first drop @-@ down box is for the quick structure of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ...
the selection field Fur@@ ther is for inser@@ ting items such as keywords , notes notes or references . the available options are :
name : with this command , a term for a section , a picture or other element is created .
reference : is used for reference to a specified term ( choose a selection box possible ) .
when using quote , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . for editing &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are required editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; K@@ ile ; by hand .
the last drop @-@ down box with the name Gr@@ Ã ¶ is used for setting the font size . you can set the font sizes for the main text , the fox notes , etc . there are the following fonts available :
when calling &amp; K@@ ile , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . 2 . the document may be written from scratch .
the brackets after the command \ \ &apos; docum@@ ent@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; specifies the font size . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text .
once the above source code example has been entered , the source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or button quick construction .
the source code must be saved before comp@@ iling . &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
if the compilation of the document fails , it should be searched for errors during logging . if it is not the case , the logging should also be followed automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed .
an environment ( environment ) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font size . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } allows the change of font sizes within the environment .
the changes are only supervised within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for changes within an environment .
there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold print , ital@@ ics , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment .
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is valid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or any other environment . a single word in a set can be ital@@ ici@@ ously represented with \ \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { rate } .
after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; latex ; drawing language is presented , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; K@@ ile ; .
once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . at least , a quote , some places in the fat and ital@@ ics and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands .
once the document has been viewed , Editor View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in case of an external viewer , the window has to be closed .
once the DVI file has been created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . just try it out and have fun .
DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ bsp ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; latex ; for read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converter or computer screens .
for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , then the document can be printed using File Print ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) .
the toolbar permits the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . as soon as the DVI ; file is created from the &amp; latex ; source text can begin the conversion into fake other formats by using the buttons in the toolbar .
the default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; latex ; files . to do this , simply set up Modern at Settings K@@ ile ... tools Build are selected .
in order to select the default search , the mouse cursor must be cli@@ cked on a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on . the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI ; the viewer is then performed .
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; latex ; document by &amp; K@@ ile ; open and skip to the corresponding line . to do this , &amp; K@@ ile ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set up as text editor ... Editor )
if there is no error when using the &amp; DVI , the viewer can have an error . if there is an error , it is displayed in the logging file or in the message window .
the logging file cl@@ auses the source of error in the source code . in the editor you can click the Check La@@ Te@@ X error and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X error for jumps between the errors . the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears . in order to view the incorrect line , the error must be cli@@ cked in the logging and &amp; K@@ ile ; jumps to the incorrect line .
once cli@@ cked on the corresponding button in the toolbar , a window will appear to select the template to use for the document . the pre @-@ set options are :
when selecting empty documents , a document may either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard will be used to create a new document . for more information , see the section .
temporary users of &amp; latex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document .
to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / latex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; K@@ ile ; can create a new template using an existing document and a selection of file template from document ...
when creating a new document from a template using File New , some strings will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings ... settings General .
when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables :
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically , it is used as follows : \ \ docum@@ ent@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ O@@ NS $ $ &#93; { item } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be taken :
when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one .
a template can be created from any &amp; latex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below .
&amp; K@@ ile ; uses &amp; k@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; k@@ ate ; is a text editor for program@@ mers with the possibility of reading and high@@ lighting many different types of text files ( including &amp; latex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
to learn more about &amp; k@@ ate ; and its options should be used the manual for K@@ ate . users of &amp; K@@ ile ; can start there directly by reading the chapter works with the editor of &amp; k@@ ate ; begin .
&amp; K@@ ile ; provides a very practical &amp; latex ; command reference , which can be called via La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a detailed description of nearly all the commands in &amp; latex ; use can be found as well as their syntax .
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to choose the &amp; tex ; word meaning that in this way the \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par \ \ par is selected .
when dra@@ gging the text with left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board .
when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window .
&amp; K@@ ile ; has the possibility to browse the different types of source code and emphasize these . for example , the different types differ ; orders from normal text and also mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color .
many assist@@ ants can add additional diving marks . this is a separate type of book@@ mark within the text . the menu items Edit bo@@ unc@@ ing marks or the appropriate keyboard allow the jump to the next or last jump mark . this is also highlighted by the jump mark so that it is automatically deleted when entering a drawing .
editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like &amp; K@@ ile ; although &amp; k@@ ate ; already offers excellent possibilities , have been added to &amp; K@@ ile ; important functions for writing a &amp; latex ; source code always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; K@@ ile ; special commands for their selection .
choose a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides ) . this extended meaning closes tables , &amp; latex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this is the only wor@@ rying thing in &amp; K@@ ile ; this means that the sections are separated by two empty lines .
choose the word under the current cursor position . this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains &amp; latex ; commands with a return line ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) end up .
to delete a part of the document , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; k@@ ate ; offers the key word C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . under Edit removal , the following commands are included in the text of the text :
remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; K@@ ile ; is included in the description to edit paragra@@ phs .
it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; latex ; therefore , &amp; K@@ ile ; for further commands in Edit surroundings for a more simple work with &amp; latex ; .
this command will jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
with this command , jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment .
if the cursor is present before or within the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the over@@ look can be lost quickly . this command closes the last desired environment , so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed .
&amp; K@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; latex ; groups that are determined by brackets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are some important commands that match those from editing environment .
with this command , jump to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the cur@@ ly opening bracket .
with this command , jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the cur@@ ly closing bracket .
if the cursor is before or behind the welded bracket of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # , jump to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
when entering many ne@@ sted groups par@@ enth@@ eses can quickly get lost over time . this command closes the last formed group so that the ne@@ sted structure of the par@@ enth@@ eses will not be destroyed .
in &amp; latex ; two simple applications are used as a substitute . for the purpose @-@ bringing implementation , the sign is used in &amp; K@@ ile ; the sign &quot; for two simple instructions is used . also for the end of the execution the sign &quot; is used . &quot; and K@@ ile ; knows this case and includes two closing quotes for &amp; latex ; one .
this automatic filing of double quotes can be set up under Pre@@ ferences ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
it can also be used to set specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and thus German or French quotes . there are also many other languages available .
when pressing Shift ; Enter key &amp; K@@ ile ; an intelligent line breaks . if the current position is within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; K@@ ile ; not just a line breaks but at the same time the command \ \ item .
close &amp; K@@ ile within a tables environment ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line breaks off .
even better - &amp; K@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; latex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under Settings ... La@@ Te@@ X .
some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) to each other . when pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; K@@ ile ; after the next tab in the above line . even though this tab is not the same , add &amp; K@@ ile ; add some gaps for the columns position of the current tab .
although &amp; k@@ ate ; already a good source code completion offers , this has been expanded in &amp; K@@ ile ; for specific commands ( mostly for &amp; latex ; ) are built @-@ in . three of them work according to requirements and the other two are for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different working modes under Pre@@ ferences ... Complete .
when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } &amp; K@@ ile ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for text ) .
when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input is removed and gener@@ ously gra@@ bs the completion list . on the other hand , the list can also shrink by entering another letter .
all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be inserted , so that an easy jump to these positions by editing jumps is possible and the desired parameters can then be mes@@ hed .
settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; All settings can be made to these lists . you can select different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; orders as well as users of the general language use .
the command mode is not useful for the completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin typ@@ ed and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of ambient conditions . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; K@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of environments .
when invo@@ king the execution mode via the menu Edit Full environment or the key Alt + Shift key , the command is automatically inserted to open the environment and it appears \ \ begin . afterwards , the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key will be termin@@ ated .
once this is done , the environment will automatically be closed again . once &amp; while , realize that it is a list environment , it will even be a first \ \ item command .
under Settings K@@ ile ; set up ... K@@ ile ; All settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the drop list of the Comp@@ ensation mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; latex ; commands .
the lists can be set up under Settings K@@ ile . as an example of a drop @-@ down list , the ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l file is used , for example , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which for example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included .
for example , if the letter L is entered and the word will be applied to the word processing mode over the menu editing or keyboard C@@ trl + Alt empty space , the letter L will be replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X .
large windows are not helpful for automatic processing . however , it has been found that many people in a document are written more than once . there@@ with , &amp; K@@ ile ; the completion for all already written wishes .
this mode can be set up in the menu settings K@@ ile ... K@@ ile can be switched off . here , the threshold value can also be set for the display of the complete damage .
the completion files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ ile / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder . mode stands for Ab@@ brevi@@ ation , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex .
the graphic design allows you to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of graphics formats , the sections should be followed .
PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is notified , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf .
in order to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are group@@ ed in groups in the creation comp@@ iling , creating conversion and creating views .
for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece , or the other conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt ; 3 , by Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file converted into a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
when using the Schnell@@ bahn command , normally a viewer is inv@@ oked after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer should be used , a new window will open every time .
a new project will be asked about the project New Project .... Hier@@ bei will ask the following information for the project :
when selecting the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file .
the Script function of &amp; K@@ ile ; allows the execution of EC@@ MA@@ Script code . scripts can be administered via scripts in the vertical led@@ ger .
the API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of &amp; K@@ ile .
first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; K@@ ile ; a system @-@ wide object ( = tile ) has the following methods :
&amp; latex ; is a quite sophisticated system in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers a lot of different help to support users .
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and / tex@@ tra@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . this includes a documentation for the packages and a further and latex . reference .
this is not only a description of all programs ( but some important packages are described ) but rather is a complete operating instructions for the &amp; latex . it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into &amp; K@@ ile ; into three important book@@ marks .
due to the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; provided , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ tur@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents to &amp; K@@ ile ; provided documents and there@@ for a graphic surface area .
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; K@@ ile ; then only the results are displayed .
double @-@ click with the mouse or pressing the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&amp; tile ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; latex ; - / tex ; source text editor , which can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; working area environment . &amp; K@@ ile ; is also part of the Fink project , which makes &amp; K@@ ile ; also on &amp; Mac ; with OS X installed .
many thanks to those who strive for the continued existence of the &amp; K@@ ile ; project and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools we all use with regard to the &amp; GNU ; license . up @-@ to @-@ date information on the contribut@@ ors is available in Men@@ orca Help &amp; C@@ ile ; .

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; with the command @-@ line interface you create random signatures or day signatures from a list . this command @-@ line interface provides the signatures for external email programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; .
for random signatures , any signature from the signature file is read from &amp; k@@ sig ; read out . through many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique .
for day signatures , the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day . for each day you can use different signatures , as with random signatures , create unique emails .
to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . in this way , you will receive an empty signature ; in the Sig@@ natures section . click on &amp; lt ; empty Sig@@ natures ; and paste in the lower section your new signature . signature @-@ example Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org When you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click the Save icon .
you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures .
to delete a signature , select it first and then in the File menu Remove or click on the icon with the red cross in the toolbar .
to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the user defined button at the bottom right and enter the new short@@ cut by pressing the button or key combination .
to use &amp; k@@ not ; to attach signatures to your e @-@ mails , you need a program like &amp; k@@ mail ; or another program that can insert the signature text from the output of a command .

the version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; all of these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as a surface and lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools .
anyone who worked with the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows me and how outstanding it is . let &apos;s take a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer rely on a terminal ; simply click on the symbol for the XML processor and done !
this application expects an index@@ .@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is located in the desired working folder , then let the current working folder be checked . if not , then remove the current working folder and enter the desired folder in the field of other folders .
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time it is started .
as already mentioned , everyone who has already worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for it .
if the opened file is index@@ .@@ doc@@ book then simply let the current working folder be selected . if not , then select the current working folder and enter the folder where index@@ .@@ doc@@ book is to be found .
when it comes to an output on the screen , their file is faulty . please check the reported errors and try again .
if the file to be checked is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply tap . if not , delete the check in current file and select the file to be checked by using other file - file cho@@ oser .
if you just want to know if the well @-@ formed file is well @-@ formed , click the well @-@ formed review selection .
to use a &amp; D@@ TD ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file , select &amp; D@@ TD ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; D@@ TD ; by definition @-@ UR@@ I ; file selection . both for the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection required .
yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ; processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library .
if the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is already selected , then the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed by using the other file cho@@ oser .
enter the name of the file as the result is named , and the file is normally stored in your home folder .
the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; laugh@@ ed , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even possibly little to do . thus , the plugin system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and don &apos;t have to wait until someone builds the gun in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . the plug @-@ ins can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements .
to install a plugin or a part , we start with the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog :
this dialog allows you to manage all of the included plug@@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in .
often several people work in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and is used for unique identification .
one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the attitude of one &apos;s own identity are important in terms of news and comments . see for further information on comments .
in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by cap@@ turing members of the team : an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something is happening . see for further information .
event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project . one example would be to record the opening and closing of the project , so that later on how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ;
event Configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties dialog can create , edit and delete events .
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . the add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub @-@ project leader .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
enter comments is simple . you can either select the note entry from the Editor context menu or input the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword in a comment section followed by comment text .
notes can be sent to a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( R@@ ole ) , where the nick@@ name of the nick@@ name of the team member is , R@@ ole a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project Manager After the area and sub @-@ project leaders should be given the appropriate range or sub @-@ project names , as in the following examples below .
nick@@ names and role names are independent of upper or lower case , but spaces around brackets and : make the note invalid .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages , which is D@@ TD @-@ agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here only above &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found in .
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta Settings ... This dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated consec@@ u@@ tively .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tag@@ x@@ ml files .
large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means the attributes are inserted in such a way as described in the tag@@ x@@ ml files .
automatically close optional tags : if checked , tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after &amp; gt ; inserted .
automatically close optional tags : as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
update start and end tag automatically : if enabled , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa .
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters to the corresponding encoding during typ@@ ing .
MI@@ ME types : facial expressions for the recognition of different types of files . the default settings can be restored using the Standard button .
standard drawing encoding : the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be passed ) . however , this setting here is ej@@ ected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
standard D@@ TD : the selected D@@ TD will be used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ TD has not been recognized . however , this setting here is exp@@ elled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash when starting the program the document can be restored from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . also for un@@ saved documents , a backup is created regularly , according to the set time .
the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time .
set the window settings to the default back at the next start is useful when the user interface is confused by changing the M@@ DI modes and / or app@@ ending views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ype command line parameter .
the warning sign area is used to control the display of warnings by hooks from non @-@ demand requests .
the place to change the behavior of V@@ PL ; to change the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as synchron@@ izing behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source text view in shared mode . see the different modes see .
here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the figure of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be set into details .
in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons .
in the structure tree settings , the visibility of nodes in the tree , the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically . empty nodes are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document .
abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means that there can be a valid group for PHP in which the if@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript .
here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part applications from the third side , which can be re@@ used by any part @-@ capable application , at the most known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified :
address : the path to the plugin when it is not located on a standard as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
input : this information is passed to the plugin when you start , so it can open the current file , the associated folder ( path of current file ) or the project folder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; component in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Read @-@ Only &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only read @-@ only parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
check the plugin : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; whether the entered information is right . pick the entry then even if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later .
for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , debu@@ gging has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no more necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) debu@@ gger was adjusted , as well as the support for the DB@@ G debu@@ gger . instead , a debu@@ gger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implem@@ entations via plug@@ ins .
currently , only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts .
using the debu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button next to the Deb@@ ug@@ ger plugin , the specific settings can be changed .
if a debu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface :
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left D@@ ock .
a view where all stops , with time numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower D@@ ock .
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the debu@@ gger is shown . appears normally in the lower D@@ ock .
depending on the supported functions of the debu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available .
with this action , the link to debu@@ gger , if necessary , is made , or it tells the plugin to listen to debu@@ gging requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debu@@ gger , so that normally you don &apos;t have to pay attention to it .
the counter@@ part to Deb@@ ug@@ ger session starts the session . closes the connection to the debu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to request a de@@ bug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the Deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a debu@@ gging request has been started , the script starts with the request .
instruc@@ ts the debu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without sending information to over@@ loaded variables and the current row number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it is given before a debu@@ gging request is given , the execution will start as soon as a request is made .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
the Deb@@ ug@@ ger performs the next instruction in the script , where possible in functions and include .
instruc@@ t the debu@@ gger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there were no current .
opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered , which should be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable .

this chapter describes how to tailor &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to your needs and how to help you to get better .
document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to give support for Mark@@ up and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility make of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages or &amp; CSS ; s &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folders are handy , symbolic buttons of fra@@ me@@ works ( above the editing window ) , insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever .
&amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ TD . see for details of conversion .
this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool lists . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
tag XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a writing error .
tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag XML files . tag folder bears the name of the description language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict )
the table below lists the elements of tag XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them .
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but only element type above itself .
the type of tag is a script function . when used , att@@ r &gt; is an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type method . indicates the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 )
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a only element type element .
specifies an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it specifies the name and type of the attribute . in addition , it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a only element type element .
returns the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the data source .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % day name % , which means the name of the current tags .
a container tag which group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this item is empty .
specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined . this element is an only element type .
specifies a list of elements that end a tag . this element is an only element type .
all Tag@@ ged XML files must start with an XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = U@@ TF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ at@@ ly ch@@ ained and closed .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause leg break@@ age , but some pieces of work would disappear .
to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is displayed at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . a further dialog will appear , whose simple instructions are to follow .
this feature is currently not available yet . currently , the check is only done when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 tagged XML file . this file describes &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the filen@@ ame for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
in the following an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; Excel function is described . the filen@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; U@@ TF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; class _ name &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via D@@ TD Edit D@@ TD settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries :
&#91; general &#93; Version = User 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ TD . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) No . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) .
an action can be set with Settings actions ... to create . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
the key short@@ cut assigned to this action . clicking the User Language button can be used to assign a short@@ cut ; with K@@ 1 the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed .
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the Det@@ ai@@ ated Settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that can change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even the quick start dialog or the various see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps .
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line , such as sh % script / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts local script folder : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name is removed .
% p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text unique is added to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; by the external script .
the parameters for this event , usually the filen@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file .
in addition to the methods listed above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in the input field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
according to the input , the output of the exported application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : regular output , written to the standard output ; error messages indicating the standard error output . it can be specified what to do with the text written on the standard output by setting the value of the output box output :
if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group . in the given case , it is not too many , so you can create a toolbar with the name of the tag .
once a tool bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings to set actions .
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode .
complete all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar .
complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it , enable &quot; Edit Day &quot; dialog when available so that input when using the action is possible .
ignore ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics more programs ( or where else it is located in your distribution ) .
&amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; uses 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel by default , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size .
please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; .
with regard to the fact that the day starts , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green will mostly be interpreted as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled to insert this symbol ; start ; tag in the current document .
after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this is done via the menu with Settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and select the desired action . next to the text box is a button , press it .
select the folder where the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK .
press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK to complete .
suppose you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions to the toolbar , or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separ@@ ators . open the tool bar to set a dialog using Settings Tool@@ bars . make sure the desired toolbar is selected .
I want to select the separ@@ ator ( at the top left ) for my toolbar . after selecting the item to be added to the toolbar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the toolbar .
for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the toolbar .
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all the symbols to ensure that everything works .
if New@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your toolbar ( s ) should be saved in the correct folder . please adjust your file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; so that your toolbar ( s ) will be loaded ( ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type .
perhaps the most notable extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like best . this is why this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use .
before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; - Rep@@ osit@@ ory check if someone has done that for you .
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the doc@@ r@@ c file . we leave the first part to you , the second we will handle here .
# K@@ DE Configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = Path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the Main Index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 Docum@@ entation Section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3@@ html
the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation now ; documentation like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Cont@@ ents , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = index@@ .@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ taxes ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the box depth ( except through reason ) m@@ das@@ h ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently at the top of the tree view &amp; m@@ das@@ h ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing , but watch &amp; &amp; &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resource files .
the content section is the area of the doc@@ r@@ c file used to design context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing one &amp; PHP ; scripts to display the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fet@@ ch _ array function . by selecting the function name and pressing C@@ trl ; H for context help , the documentation would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file link lines .
a simple list of text @-@ separated context elements to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can save your doc@@ r@@ c file to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as specified in your doc@@ r@@ c file ) in the same folder as doc@@ r@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
if you are certain that this is good and it is worth to be shared , send your doc@@ r@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform .
with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failed resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this :
the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an Email @-@ mail menu entry , such as D@@ TD D@@ TD pack@@ et ( D@@ TE@@ P ) with email , tool bar tool@@ bars with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree .
the resources can be uploaded to our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . to make a useful contribution , we recommend signing the resources for which it needs a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for later users .
when up@@ loading , you will be asked for their pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private g@@ pg key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be saved ) , or in the event that you have multiple keys , you can choose one . in the New resource dialog , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading .
up@@ loading can be uploaded from the D@@ TD D@@ TD package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , up@@ loading toolbar toolbar and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree .
after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems it warns and it can then be abor@@ ted . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource .
it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day XML format . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ TD to a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically .
the conversion can be started from the D@@ TD Load and Con@@ vert menu of a D@@ TD . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ TD Description that should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears :
target directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! doc@@ type definition line : the string that is in ! doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / D@@ TD HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand these and full benefits from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze oneself with these fundamental concepts . this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
global elements are available for each , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it stores everything that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool lists , actions and patterns in the global tree , which is then available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment .
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be all of &amp; CSS ; pattern up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply put , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , resulting in the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project .
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the card readers with information and the tool@@ bars . please suggest in , and for more information on these areas .
you can click on the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as closing , del@@ eting , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document .
right @-@ click in the editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste / paste ) , editing the tags under the mouse cursor , help to the word under the mouse cursor or open the file , if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor .
at the top of the editor window are the editor &apos;s toolbar . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as the default for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs .
the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the icon that represents the tag . now you can enter the data for this straight inserted day . if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields .
the tree views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open them and ro@@ ve them . in the presentation with card readers are available for files , project , templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation tree views .
project Management is a powerful tool , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mouse click . actions such as Add , Remove , Upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed .
another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . all possibilities are open to you .
templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects can only be used in the project .
here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration into Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script . by clicking with the right mouse button further functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or email it .
this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . by clicking on an element , a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it , it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; Docum@@ entation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added , edited and viewed .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; two tab tra@@ ckers at the bottom of the window can be accessed using the useful information : the message window and the problem window .
this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used D@@ TD of the current document and all changes to D@@ TD will be displayed .
this tab displays all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window .
the toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command . the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a toolbar with E@@ Mail . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the toolbar as compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a toolbar in an email , they can backup and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
it is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should make sure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H is located in front of your bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
while the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with a obvious idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up languages editor ? well , this would make him the most amazing web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done .
no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the suitable &amp; IDE ; be .
well , to the above claim must be stated that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; developer community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ old is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to expand as they need for their needs .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by using self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly converted to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more in the detailed documentation is with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; currently developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located where the oldest record is taken out .
this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . if you want to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported .
converts special characters to &amp; HTML from the clip@@ board , so that they are displayed correctly and not be mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction .
converts text from clip@@ board to &amp; URL ; Description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s is . primarily to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor day .
switches the block selection to or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a row number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP script releases error messages !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debu@@ gger .
switching and switching the problem repor@@ ter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem repor@@ ter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the toolbar left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
when there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document .
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu group@@ ed according to the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
searches the project directory for new files that could be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project .
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , manage the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find the details .
loads a project toolbar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to store your tool bar . allows you to select the type of toolbar : locally or project .
opens a dialog to add a new toolbar . this creates only the name . actions must be added to the toolbar by Settings ... . toolbar buttons are stored via toolbar toolbar or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar .
removes a toolbar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the toolbar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do that .
this allows you to send your own toolbar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team for the toolbar to be present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as app@@ endi@@ x .
enables up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where every other can access it . see in .
load a &amp; D@@ TD ; you or anyone else made and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
load / refresh the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TD ; should be refres@@ hed without the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global K@@ DE folder , the load fails .
this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar . if the default ( HTML ; ) toolbar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar .
allows access to the current tag setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; D@@ TD ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus .
activates or de@@ activates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by tool bar is denied if this tag contradic@@ ts the rules at this place .
in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in to disable it .
select the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the current version .
sel@@ ects the type of line identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh .
checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; D@@ TD ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
immediate switching between different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes require time or un@@ sigh@@ tly graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub @-@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier .
in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . selecting an insert will activate the corresponding sub @-@ window .
enables the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window at or off .
the changes in this dialog will affect any application using the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser .
set the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; k@@ ate ; you can find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones you can add and change the sequences .
this should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter but is not implemented yet .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , they find the way here .
the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled with the best from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Properties Project Properties .
here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering Name , file will be filled automatically .
this is the name of the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in lower@@ case letters and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( eg foo@@ .@@ web@@ bo@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , unless you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment could be necessary .
this is the folder where the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this is the folder where the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and tool@@ bars by default . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard .
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . with server @-@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently .
tap if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be integrated . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook up .
with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to your discretion .
this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or by removing the check@@ box , clips from the project .
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Profile or with Shift + F@@ 7 keyboard short@@ cut .
some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of filen@@ ames ( plac@@ eholders possible ) that are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
additional option to the top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ or , are excluded from the project .
the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views .
this allows you to select the debu@@ gger you want . currently , only gu@@ bed is supported . more information about gu@@ bed can be found in . debu@@ gger plugin can be configured with the Options button . troubleshooting is described .
in the Profile tab , Upload Pro@@ files ( see in ) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by adjusting its own tree view for each profile .
in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details .
in the event configuration sub@@ window , you can turn event actions and add , change or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs , such as securing a file . see the details .
by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . you can &apos;t influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project , select Open Project ... from the Project menu or the Project icon open from the toolbar . the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . the same happens when you load a new project .
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
folders behave as well , but the entries are missing and open with ... with the right mouse button context menu :
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
allows you to remove the current profile . if only one profile is available , the button will be bl@@ ended to prevent removing .
the password will be kept in the kernel memory and forgotten when logging in . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather un@@ safe password will not be saved on the disk -@@ option .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many flood profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed :
this is the name of the server to which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs .
the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port .
depending on your anxiety threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text .
a project view is just one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and tool@@ bars .
views can be opened , opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar , accessible via the toolbar Project toolbar .
this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this not only helps increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus to its own working method .
as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are designed for the best way using the toolbar . use and addition differ . the addition of tool@@ bars is discussed below in the Adding of Tool@@ bars .
the toolbar and the symbols on it can be set using context menu ( right @-@ click on the toolbar ) , in which with New Action , a New toolbar can be created , other actions such as toolbar can be executed , toolbar names or tool@@ bars can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar are to be visible .
by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a toolbar , the entries will be removed and actions edited , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory .
the toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Tool@@ bars ... and set Settings actions ..
templates are in essence document skel@@ et@@ ons , code sni@@ pp@@ ets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , move , or link any existing directory into the template tree . templates are in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you set for the file system .
some templates provided with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
binary templates are usually included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . more information about the template tree is available .
documents can be from any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specific documents are created in appropriate sub@@ folders . it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information on the template tree .
this kind of templates is useful if you do not want to insert a new document based on a template but the same text area again and again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final grade to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl . see for more information on the template tree .
as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently , there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; ) and choose File As Tem@@ plate Save As Local Tem@@ plate ...
once this is done , note that ( even if it has been saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree among project templates .
select text in your document and click File As Tem@@ plate Save choice as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be simply dra@@ gged and put on the tree view templates .
the creation of binary templates is simple : copy the file into a template folder . all file management functions can be used for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or inser@@ ting over the Kon@@ quer@@ or file tree .
you can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files to select a folder on the right and secure site template . by default , the project folder will be backed up , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template .
project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ tend he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; designing , inser@@ ting files or linking them with them . in addition , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects .
the template structure in the Tem@@ plate Tem@@ plate is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above .
to specify the behavior of a folder in the template list , right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu . the following dialog appears :
a drop @-@ down box with the three types previously described ; files , text or templates . this selection is da@@ zz@@ led as soon as parent attributes are en@@ forced .
this is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is configured to be configured , it would basically de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the bla@@ h would appear with something like text @-@ tree . if nothing appears , you &apos;ll probably find yourself in a root folder .
allows previous or updated text for templates in this folder . this might be general he@@ aders or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying content templates to a folder with special header lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation with the matching he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to right mouse button ) via a full command file for adding folders or copying and inser@@ ting templates from one place to another .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provides two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor , which can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source text editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t if necessary to the source code editor in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; editor are visible in the source code .
when working with the V@@ PL ; editor at a document that &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol shows the V@@ oh@@ and@@ rite of &amp; PHP ; source code . it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor . there are no plans to change this behavior .
the second mode works just like the first one , except that simultaneously the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor , and the cursor in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is activated , this mode is already active , the key pressure is activated from a window to the other , where the position is maintained in the document .
the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source text editor is configurable via settings Qu@@ anta . by choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically . in general , the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time span . basically , the recommendation is : a small span for fast calcul@@ ator and a large span for slow .
assuming you want to change the title of the web page , the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; editor .
met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click on the list allows to change the content , e.g. keywords on the name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way to create pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is possible exactly as with the Met@@ a elements . editing of CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file .
the use of the cursor is possible , as in a word processor , by moving the arrows . under rare circumstances , the cursor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the mark works as usual . text can be inserted by typ@@ ing and deleted by means of a button or remo@@ ver button .
inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way using the toolbar editor , as in the source code editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , each other surrounding anchor day must be removed .
some tool lists such as the tables assistant or the list assistant are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , tables or lists need to be used tool@@ bars .
&amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . in contrast to other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be followed .
to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , need the libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are already available at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available .
new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db @-@ compatible mode , or@@ phan@@ ed support points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled .
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the complete path from a filen@@ ame without a path . filen@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ loaded still file name with relative path to the working folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is , for example , a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l , the following input is possible :
this command checks for a partial or entire agreement with a su@@ age called QNA@@ P@@ ME or a specified mode name . &amp; eg ; template matches with any QNAP ME file containing the template template .
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; will be extended according to the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 will be added to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1
a requested stopping point must be resolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this will be performed automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I have written .
the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file .
the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where only the ind@@ entation had changed . mer@@ ging these changes was a small night@@ mare .
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions have been added .
for example , if you want to quickly compare text , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison window .
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function transformed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps resol@@ ving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . in this editor you can even edit the result directly .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge entire folders . this screen shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in folder merge :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today color monitors . if you often have to check codes , you will like this function .
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are displayed visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . )
if a file is equal , and the other one differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different .
if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can ease the typ@@ ing by typ@@ ing only the file name of the first file . example :
C@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 k@@ diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
opening dialog allows you to manually typ@@ ing file names , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the opening dialog re@@ members your selection and displays them again next time . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C empty , the analysis of differences with two files is performed .
using the Fol@@ der ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or mer@@ ging of folders is initiated . if a file is selected for A , but for B and C but a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the filen@@ ame from A in the two other folders .
when mer@@ ging is enabled , the input field is active for target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving .
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with Settings . here you can set options before you start comparing / merge .
sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to draw text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button .
you can also drag and drop : simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
what is the idea behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar to these functions , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two appropriate files , load them in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , and then compare them . now you can easily copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections .
note : at the moment you can extract nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported .
warning : some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste ( instead of copy and paste ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost .
the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the filen@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse take a while above the line . then a small auxiliary window will display the full name . )
the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed via the settings menu . )
when a difference is detected , one sees the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( mer@@ ging ) good to see .
if differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few rare individual cases . )
the vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks is enabled , the line will be dotted with dotted lines .
the result window ( among the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription output : , the filen@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ alters &#93; if you have edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts .
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to move to the next resolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually .
by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . this group will then highlight the current group . it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears .
sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic mer@@ ging or manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps select another source again . this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere .
the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board , if you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function .
note : if the sources are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources , changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters .
navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , page on , page starting , beginning , end , C@@ trl @-@ Start and C@@ trl @-@ End , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs .
in the output window you can also use the other buttons for editing . by inser@@ ting the button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is insert mode . )
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture up / C@@ trl @-@ picture down ) or to the next / previous un@@ resolved conflict .
to copy the mark to the clip@@ board , you need to press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clip@@ board and eliminating manual copying . however , be careful with this option because you could acci@@ dentally over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board .
new@@ lines are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use a carriage return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , so you should not use bin@@ aries .
the options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically during loading and restored at the next start . ( set up menu Set@@ ting &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... )
choose a font with a fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . )
when you activate this option , differences are displayed in ital@@ ics . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens at all .
on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be rendered ast@@ ert . on these systems , the Pre@@ ferences button automatically adjust@@ s an odd color .
when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted .
when you press input or return , the setting of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line .
if this option is checked , each selection will be automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copy to the clip@@ board is om@@ itted then .
you can select which type of line you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
when comparing files &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , find all fully identical lines in the source files . only during this first step white signs can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . even when mer@@ ging white signs are not ignored .
some editors ( on some systems ) save a carriage return character &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only store a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . usually ignored &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the carriage return character will be made visible , however , as a white character will be treated . during mer@@ ging this option must be disabled . in default this option is disabled .
this option is disabled by default . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters .
by default this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters .
inten@@ sely looking for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slow with very large files .
in automatic jumping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue .
automatically dis@@ solves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use better the functions Cho@@ ose A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments .
these options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and conducting a merge . look for details on the directory comparison and merge .
if a file is stored and an older version already exists , then the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup .
adjust the language of the user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally over the control centre . )
the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you enable this option , the upper setting will be used for all entries .
the selection fields for the encoding appears a short note on what the local encoding is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character . )
adjust the file encoding for source files . this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged .
if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving .
if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files could be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option one can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands .
switch this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in the text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments . )
this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color co@@ ded over@@ sight column . however , sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selecting A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ c ; C is displayed next to the normal one second over@@ sight column with the required information .
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines . just send out the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
sometimes you see the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files . a simple click starts mer@@ ging and uses the file name of the last source file as pre @-@ set name for output file . ( if this function is used to restart mer@@ ging , then the name of the last file used will be maintained . )
when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . you can use this function e.g. to cut off dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or to correct the ind@@ entation .
when reading a file , it will first be passed to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command . you can write your own pre@@ processor which corresponds exactly to your requirements . each entry line must have a corresponding output line .
the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program that themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l is completely sufficient .
use this pre@@ processing command for line spac@@ ing to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; The \ \ 1 in the sub@@ stitution string refers to the found text in the first string pair . the \ \ U converts the found text into capital letters .
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ keyword : \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ log \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ \ \ _ BA@@ R _ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
the ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line spac@@ ers . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , i.e. almost extingu@@ ished .
sometimes you might want to perform several replac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the replac@@ ements . example :
instead of sed you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / re@@ ge@@ x@@ p / replace / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos;@@ Aller@@ hol@@ dings are different in per@@ l some details . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the preceding &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for display and mer@@ ging . the other operations only change the data that the new@@ line algorithm sees .
note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor will see the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input .
the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences , you may acci@@ dentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data .
often program@@ mers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively .
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can customize the proposal before the start ,
... can simulate mer@@ ging and displays the simul@@ ated changes without actually performing it ,
... execute selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) ,
this is very similar to comparing and mer@@ ging individual files . you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
when three folders merge , folder 1 is used as the base . if no target folder is specified , used &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder .
note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically , not the merge . to start the merge , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details . )
while reading the folder , you will be informed about the current progress . if you cancel the scan of the folder , only the files that have been compared will be listed .
when scanning the folder is complete , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list box with the results on the left side , ...
each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on the + / - click on the object or by double clicking the arrow keys for left / right . the folder menu includes two functions All sub @-@ directories and open all sub @-@ directories with which you can open or fold up all folders .
when you double @-@ click a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears .
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
if the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be automatically selected . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type .
as shown in the above picture , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C .
in identical entries the color is identical , even if the age of the entries is different .
folders are considered to be identical if their entire contents are identical . then folders also have the same color . with folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , becomes red .
... A and C are identical but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... B and C are identical but not A : copy from A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists )
... A , B and C do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
... A and B do not have the same type of file ( e.g. if a folder and B is a file ) : error : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such er@@ ron@@ eous objects exist , the merge cannot be started .
the mode to synchron@@ ize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option of synchron@@ izing directories is active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ...
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as the visible file name for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
when two folders merge and select the New File instead of merge ( unsure ) , then examine &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical . files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started .
during merge , one file will be processed after the other . you status column shows Fer@@ tig when mer@@ ging was successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if mer@@ ging is completed , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right .
if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ resolved , resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged . )
you can either merge the currently selected item ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the merge actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start the merge .
please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then in the Three folder merge mode C will be used as a target . B and / or B will be used as a target in synchron@@ izing A and / or B .
if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises :
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the folder menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) to merge only the current record : select Action from the current element or press F@@ 6 .
if there are still invalid mer@@ ging actions by conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears indicating the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them .
when you merge all entries , a dialog box with the Options dialog appears , simul@@ ating and Cancel .
select Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then execute certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a merge window opens ( note the screen shot ) .
when you are finished with a file , select / res@@ ume directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , a corresponding dialog appears . then leads &amp; k@@ h@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry .
at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with mer@@ ging .
if some entries have been merged individually , remember &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) do not merge them again . even if the merge has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered as done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again .
the menu Set@@ ting menu of &amp; k@@ Diff@@ 3 ; ( Set up menu Set@@ ting - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) has now a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o .
ignor@@ ing files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be configured with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
in some file systems , files have a hiding attribute . in other file systems , a previous score marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default .
links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is disabled by default .
when the option is switched off , the symbolic links will be compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated like normal folders and scann@@ ed recur@@ sively . ( note that if the option is turned on , the links will result in a loop and &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cras@@ hes . ) This option is switched off in default .
performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statisti@@ c columns . ( the number of solved , un@@ resolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . )
if you compare large folders to a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
similar to the date of change . there is no real comparison . the files are considered identical if they are equal . for example , this can be useful if the modification date has been lost when copying . please use caution . this option is switched off in default .
enables synchron@@ izing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging are selected so that both folders are identical . also the results of mer@@ ging files are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in default .
if there are differences , the copying of the newer file will be suggested as action instead of mer@@ ging . ( this will be considered in@@ secure because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been changed . ) This option is switched off in default .
if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version is renamed and ob@@ tains the extension .@@ original If an old backup file with the .@@ ori@@ g extension already exists , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merge of single files , not just the merge of entire folders . this option is enabled in default .
normally , the folder merge view is visible during mer@@ ging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want it , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between directory and text windows between the two views .
you probably prefer to simply compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the folder menu . you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge . once you save the result , the status will be cleared and the file will not be merged once you run the folder merge .
however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : new to read
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things should be noted :
a path can be relative and@@ . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute .
special characters have to be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , empty character &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 .
sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes by the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations :
or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then a file will always be accepted as a link destination . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) .
there is no way to edit permissions or change dates . therefore , the permissions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( please refer to the option Trust the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files . )
the main purpose of use is now as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to launch K@@ Diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select Add to K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu .
normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . however , if it is used as a k@@ not , it assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . then the patch program to recover the missing file .
in the context menu , you can click a patch file and select Pre@@ view in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created .
if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as a part executed , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small toolbar and menu . mer@@ ging or comparing folders is not supported in K@@ Part mode .
tools named K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now called pare ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the diff tool collection .
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and learned a lot by pe@@ aking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all program@@ mers who have gone this way or are going to go this way .
you compiled the program from the sources and probably didn &apos;t tell the configure script to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic .
if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines of next to each other , this is the dence but this is often the case .
the editor will remember every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information .
the effort was too large so far . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text , another editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ ens ; appeared and the text can &apos;t be deleted . what does that mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses already many colors to highlight differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or newer .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of the last changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
to compile and install &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution :
K@@ DE @-@ dir returns the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file .
since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake are used , you should have no problems while comp@@ iling . if difficulties arise , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Ma@@ iling lists thereof .
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Remove ) copies to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift @-@ In@@ sert ) inserts the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position resp@@ . replaces the current marker .
only show differences : files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder .
( in the current version of the program , you will need to re @-@ read the Update folder after changes to these options . )
there are only entries that show differences . this also leads to the fact that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when mer@@ ging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after mer@@ ging . ( the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version . ) This option is switched off in default .
note the buttons to select the source with the label A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already available ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed when you click on the button .
this option is disabled by default . different characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , finish them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and at several .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other work@@ tops .
the context menu hing@@ es on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only displays the two entries P@@ ager . if cli@@ cked , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ize , on desktop and finish .
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
if this check box is selected , windows can be moved within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ tops .
if this field is crossed , the name of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops will be displayed in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
tick this field leaves the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; view the numbers of the virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . if it is selected along with name , the names are provided with ord@@ inal numbers , &amp; eg ; 1st desktop .
if this box is crossed , the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager .
when this field is crossed , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only empty work@@ spaces are displayed to allow them to be selected .
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map displays a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as made from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizontal shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in horizontal and vertical in a vertical row , which is very well suited for viewing on the side of the desktop .
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents .

you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the small print or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for use of &amp; K@@ mag .
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded with new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance computers .
when you &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as shown above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window .. The image shown in the magni@@ fying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window below .
in default setting &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fying glass . alternatively , you can represent a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection window mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) .
if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter to hide . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; poin@@ ter .
in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways :
move the cursor in the magni@@ fication window and hold the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fication window . this also works with the arrow keys .
if you additionally press the Shift key or press the &amp; M@@ MB ; you can move the selection window .
this combination allows you to change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the bottom right corner is to be moved .
&amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , store it in a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more .
starts or stops the updating of the ad . stopping the update causes the required CPU time to go around 0 .
select the refresh rate ( Very low , Low , Medium , High , Very high ) . the higher the refresh rate , the more CPU time is needed .
in this mode , a selection window is displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window .
&amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to save files , open a new window , print , rel@@ o@@ ad ( with the button document again in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Re@@ duc@@ ers &amp; etc ; .
K@@ mag also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use a screen magni@@ fier , so as if you use a magni@@ fying glass to view the small print in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired .

&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cursor continues to wait for a while on the same spot . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Rep@@ eti@@ tive Stra@@ in @-@ In@@ jury Syndrome ) and those of the mouse click pain .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click once the mouse cursor continues for a while at the same point . it is meant to help people who suffer from the rep@@ eti@@ tive stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . however , it can em@@ ulate the pulling with the mouse . however , this requires a little practice .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also seek pain caused by the use of your computer . suffer from pain that is related to the use of your computer , if this has not happened yet .
to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result can be different for everyone .
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly .
is the intelligent move activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a pause after it emul@@ ates pressing the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button . in this way , you can drag the drag at pressed mouse button . the intelligent move requires a little practice , but you get used to it quickly .
this dwell time must end after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; execute a mouse click .
if Intelligent Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is activated . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button wait , before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports clicking through mouse shift . if this function activates a slow moving to the left and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ k@@ es.@@ txt , but can be changed later .
if the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . to do this , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the General tab . there is a sli@@ der sound buffer that you set at a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times .
when this setting is selected , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will start ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; started . this function is currently only available at &amp; k@@ de ; available . at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically .
reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened . if you have already pressed the App@@ ly button , the settings will be reset to the state after the last press of App@@ ly .
best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the intelligent move should be turned off first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later push the intelligent move .
if you use the audi@@ ble click it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; for sounds .
first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again .
if your mouse is bu@@ cking , you should clean your mouse . that &apos;s usually quite simple . the trick here is that you don &apos;t just clean the mouse ball but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball .
first you have to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . but it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse .
if you have removed the ball , you &apos;d have to see the rolls . they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and dirt can easily scra@@ pe with a flat blade or finger nail .
in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the intelligent move in this case , that means &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can stop by releasing the mouse button .
this happens when you &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use under another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click . this will reset the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue working as usual .
problem : if you enter text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place .
solution : use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it . but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . this way , accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows .
I try to work with intelligent push , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text .
the intelligent move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to select text to copy and paste it into the clip@@ board , or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . here are some advice on this :
do not use the intelligent move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select text instead : run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again .
use the audi@@ ble mouse @-@ click . thus , each time &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is played , the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when the sliding time starts when the intelligent move is moved . later you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . but it needs some practice .
to be able to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed , which should be the case in most systems .
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor moves briefly . this program has been developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome and which prepares the an@@ a@@ thetic of the mouse buttons .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be done with the mouse .

&amp; mouth ; is a program with which silent users can let their computers speak for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; mu@@ te users can let the computer speak for itself . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sets that are to be spoken once more .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen shot ) enter the command that will later be used for the speech output of text . further details can be found in the description of the setup dialog .
on the second page you can choose the standard text@@ book . from the text@@ books you can choose often used text passages without having to type them . of course , the text passages can be processed .
on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for word completion . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so only correctly spell words are included in the word completion .
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains basically an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen shot ) and a default memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen shot ) .
if you have access to mouth , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sets which are to be spoken once again .
with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; This dialog contains two file cards , voice output and settings , page editing and the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service .
in the Box Office input field , type the command to call the language generator . in the selection box below the input field , specify the encoding that will be passed on to the voice generator .
&amp; mouth ; know two ways to pass the text on . select the check box if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the voice generator .
if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
of course , the command to the voice output depends on your voice generator . you will find this command in the documentation of your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x .
with possible t@@ d as voice service will use &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the further settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ales language service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed .
with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text@@ book or in the paste for text passages .
with the selection of Instant Mess@@ ages the chosen text passage is directly spoken and additionally inserted in the default memory . with the selection of in the input field , the chosen text passage is entered only into the input field .
with the second selection field closing the editing window for Text@@ pass@@ buch , you can specify whether the text pas@@ sage@@ way should be saved automatically when closing the editing window .
with the selection of text pas@@ sage@@ ways , the book is saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard changes , the text pas@@ sage@@ way will not be saved . select Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pas@@ sage@@ way is to be saved .
the Wor@@ ding Menu page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word completion . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a drop @-@ down box when this list contains more than one dictionary . with this drop @-@ down box , you can select the dictionary you are using .
with the buttons on the right of the page you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and select the language for the dictionary .
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; mouth ; then read the language and k@@ not ; the number of each word is simply determined by counting the text . in addition , you can compare the wor@@ d@@ list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary .
with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they should be weigh@@ ted .
with this option , you create a new , empty dictionary without any entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically insert into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time .
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are represented as tree structure .
in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text pas@@ sage@@ way , you can only change its name .
add actions like new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either by selecting in the menu bar , toolbar or through a drop @-@ down menu .
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; key .
the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory .
the currently active sentence is spoken . if text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sets of the default memory .
when this menu item is selected , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool bar is positioned above the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the trimm@@ ed left side and drag the toolbar can be moved to another place .
if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow bar in the lower part of the main window is displayed with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not checked , this status bar is hidden .
if this menu item is selected , a sliding bar for text passages with entries is displayed . by default , the bar is positioned above the editing pane directly under the toolbar . by clicking on the hat@@ ched left side and dra@@ gging the toolbar can be moved to another place .
probably you have not entered the command for voice output properly or not completely . open Settings k@@ mouth ; setup ... , open the General Settings page and enter the command for voice output on the tab language edition . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for more details . )
Festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows the festival to be used free of charge without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival .
Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows you to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge without any restrictions .
to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the three following commands :
for the third example , the option must be turned on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . )
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a voice generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications .
in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA .
unfortunately H@@ adi@@ fax like to swal@@ low the last character of the text , so that an additional character must be added . therefore , the full command is more complex than in the other examples :
( CAT - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / hadi@@ fax / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / d@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option data must be turned on as default input .
the voice output dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a language service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use frac@@ t@@ d as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set .
to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed .
to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully using a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ not ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the voice generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration .
&amp; mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , can let text output by the computer . it is a list of already spoken pro@@ positions that the user can always spend again and again .
note that there is no speech synthes@@ izer . on the computer a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter or run k@@ hel@@ p@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice output system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service allowing each application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program@@ mers ready to be equipped with their applications with T@@ TS capabilities .
read texts ( or parts thereof ) in the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; even if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other &amp; k@@ ate ; applications .
voice output is performed using the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher , which uses various background programs such as es@@ peak , festival , etc .
allows creation of language editions in command line ( or shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; utility program .
in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for speech mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) .
the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows , the T@@ TS services over &amp; d@@ bus ; offers .
an application with &amp; GUI ; for configuration and setup of kt@@ ales over kt@@ ales m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for the web browser &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a web page or parts thereof .
a module for the text editor &amp; k@@ ate ; with which a text file can be read completely or in part .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you can find the list via ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de @-@ goo@@ d. the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , channel # k@@ de ) .
before you can use it , you need to install program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher and set it properly .
at the first start of t@@ m@@ gr or as long as no actors are set up , the card card spokes@@ man will be displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card General will appear .
most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . you should set up at least one speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; using since the program speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker .
different speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer lengths for the same printer .
if you click on the tab leader in kt@@ ales m@@ gr , the tab card will be displayed . this will also appear automatically when you start t@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up .
all speakers are listed in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not give a speaker .
select a speaker from the list with one click and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below .
with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to push the speaker in the list one line further down . the order of the speakers in the list also determines their priority .
click one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
choose a type of voice here , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a boy and girl &apos;s voice to choose from .
if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab speaker . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit .
now you can almost use it . go back to the General tab and check that voice output is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is enabled so that the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read text orders .
if you have set up at least one speaker , you can start &amp; k@@ de the voice output system . click the General tab to open this card . here you can set up some general options .
check this check box to activate the &amp; kt@@ ts ; system . this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start succe@@ eds , the card card orders will be displayed and you can create text orders and read . see . remove the mark , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and the T@@ TS system from &amp; k@@ de ; de@@ activated .
if kt@@ es@@ m@@ gr is termin@@ ated , runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
if this check box is selected and kt@@ mu@@ g appears while reading automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the read is finished .
with buttons in this series , you can start , stop , pause , pause and res@@ ume text orders .
with the buttons in this series you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be taken over all pages .
the card order will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been started . to launch K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the General tab and enable voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; then select the text that is to be read and select the main menu Tools Text . after a short time the voice output should start .
it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a web page . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; he@@ aders and other invisible brands are also read .
in &amp; k@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . first check if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that is to be read , and select Edit Text in the Main Menu . then the voice output should start .
this also works if &amp; k@@ ate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ not@@ tify is the news system of &amp; k@@ de ; which informs you about events specified by you . you can read the text of these messages from &amp; kt@@ ts ; read it .
in &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , set up a message when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the I@@ RC message text .
supports one &amp; k@@ de ; program K@@ not@@ tify , appears a menu entry No@@ tification in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ tify vary depending on the application .
filter for string replacement provides a good possibility in &amp; kt@@ ts ; wron@@ g@@ ly stressed or flaw@@ ed messages to correct . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from messages sent by mail , and additionally the expression / local / in@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as provided .
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
in filters , text is edited before it is sent to the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving pron@@ unciation in order to replace mis@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a suitable language and speaker or to circum@@ vent certain short@@ com@@ ings of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices .
to understand how filters work , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes between four types of texts .
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and will hold these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the stopped jobs will be res@@ um@@ ed .
al@@ erts have the next priority . this stage is important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and plain text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
messages are the next highest priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you &amp; eg ; you can read a long text on a web page , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; messages are also messages .
the rest are simple text orders . each order that you send from the card card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of an application that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special ur@@ gency .
all four types of orders are processed in queu@@ es except the output of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such read , this issue will stop and termin@@ ate .
first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . they are applied to normal warnings , messages , and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages .
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future , there may still be other types of filters .
text boxes replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable form .
&amp; XML ; reform@@ ers use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are some X@@ SL@@ T files for translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; included in SS@@ ML .
with speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the voice card spokes@@ man , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it .
each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter .
when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom .
this shows the list of normal filters that are set up . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom .
click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter and the following setup di@@ alogs will be displayed .
you will need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative patterns for the setup of string reduction filters . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text .
enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters .
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Er@@ posit column . the list is processed in the order displayed from top to bottom .
click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list .
with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list .
if a language is entered here , the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you press the C@@ trl key while clicking the C@@ trl key .
if a value is entered here , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ as . example : conversation , k@@ mail
the application ID of running programs is provided with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 shows , you may only enter copies .
the string replace filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if identical . if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts .
when comparing words , the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . words must therefore be limited to both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) .
in this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions . but if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can enter it in the di@@ alogs add or edit as help to assemble these expressions .
XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the utility x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient .
the speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the voice card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . for example , you can specify that text from k@@ mail should be read by a female voice .
before &amp; kt@@ ts ; if a text is handed over to the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker features that the program provides , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker is selected with the speaker selection filter .
if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is on your system the &amp; k@@ de ; Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering .
to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; .
specify the characteristics of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements . click the button on the right to see the dialog box selection .
use these buttons to store or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
the speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Di@@ esen filter apply if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; d@@ bus ; .
the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the voice synthes@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use .
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API by &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both APIs will be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility web page ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications call for voice output editing via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
text of text to read and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give
open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ windows . start t@@ t@@ d in one window , then t@@ m@@ gr in the other .
none of the so @-@ called speech synthes@@ izer supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Re@@ form@@ er@@ filter , but when using the module for festival , web pages are not read .
due to an error in festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able works at all . you also need to do this if you do not use this voice for reading websites . also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H .
certain characters or punc@@ tu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors during the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only cow@@ ard@@ worm is spent . what can I do about it ?
first of all , make sure that the option character encoding is set to the right value for the respective language . if there are problems with specific characters or words , these may be fixed by a string replace filter .

the voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license .
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download the package c@@ em@@ ming with &amp; kt@@ ts ; from it download . &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can find the source code from k@@ de@@ bau@@ d ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / .
contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / espe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html .
American English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza .
K@@ T@@ TS works with any voice synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a console .
the list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or ob@@ sol@@ ete . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . also look at the website of kt@@ ts ; , according to information which are not yet contained in this manual .
the program &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an adap@@ table module architecture for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , contact the developer team .
the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c User Language program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML conversion filter , but it is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command .
to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) , including the k@@ deli@@ bs packages and the development files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
if you have the source code of &amp; kt@@ ts ; refer to the source tree archive for link or download the tar@@ ball currently created every night , and install the program with the following commands :
before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first of all , check that your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . you can use the sp@@ d @-@ conf shell script to do this .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that uses the program speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is possible directly and the script sp@@ d @-@ conf is no longer needed .
a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can return set or paragraph style , repeat , pause or cancel the output .
if you give an application text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female , it is used , otherwise the best fitting speaker will be chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; select a speaker , see in .
when you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit to add a speaker to the list , or click Edit , the tab speaker device will be displayed . as an example , the module for Festival Interactive is shown below . for details on the modules , see below .
enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you just have to enter the festival .
select the encoding for text passed to the festival . if voices , the &amp; kt@@ ts are known , this setting will be performed automatically . generally , Western languages are used ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
with these sli@@ ders you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some controls and display this gray , the voice chosen by you does not allow you to adjust these settings .
some voices like multi @-@ sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that ( with greater memory consumption ) the first set is synthes@@ ized faster .
if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly to App@@ ly ) . see .
if this check box is selected , the program window is displayed at the start of the kt@@ ales m@@ gr . otherwise after the start only the symbol kt@@ ales m@@ gr appears in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window .
if this check box is selected and t@@ m@@ gr runs not yet , it appears in the system area as soon as the K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading .
here are all orders listed in the queu@@ e , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the file card spokes@@ man .
with the buttons in this series , you can proceed in the list below or back in the list below . ( but not every order consists of several sentences ) .
with a click on the OK button all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and t@@ m@@ gr will be res@@ ized to the icon in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window .
if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card . see also .
here only text orders are listed and managed . outputs of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in .
select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries .
if G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de is to be used for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here .
set the speech speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about the double normal speaking speed . in order for these settings to be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to apply the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA equipment includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt , select Standard .
you can set up special actions on this map , which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language jobs :
the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the output of the screen readers has been read , the stopped jobs will be res@@ um@@ ed .
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is reserved to important messages such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and plain text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
messages are the next priority . a message breaks normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that pron@@ o@@ unces news . if you &amp; eg ; just read a long text on a website , you can go with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless , someone who just enters the room .
if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the queu@@ e .
this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound and introduc@@ tory messages are active , the introduc@@ tory sound will be played before the introduc@@ tory message .
the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the output of screen readers , there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority .
to leave &amp; kt@@ ts ; read K@@ not@@ tify messages , run kt@@ m@@ gr and click No@@ ti@@ fications . the tab card noti@@ fications appears .
check this check box to turn on &amp; k@@ de ; alert noti@@ fications . if this setting is not selected , the remaining settings are disabled and &amp; kt@@ ts ; do not read al@@ erts .
when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played is from &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read .
use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list .
this event reads the message , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone mentioned your nick@@ name in an I@@ RC message .
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list will be ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .
use this drop @-@ down box to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; to do when an event occurs . you have the following choices :
if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders :
you can enter here the characteristics of the desired speaker . standard sel@@ ects the speaker , which is displayed in the list on the tab speaker as the top entry . see also .
note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a particular event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application .
the event All No@@ ti@@ fications for the Application Standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this purpose , you can specify the default al@@ erts as follows :
use the Save button to save the settings for the notification in a file . use the Save button to load stored settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except all noti@@ fications are deleted .
the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output . this standard contains brands for controlling voice , speaking speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . also brands for controlling the pron@@ unciation of for example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard .
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British Male ) as this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the output of SS@@ ML .
if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ously .

there are two types of filters - normal filters and syntax detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . thus , &amp; kt@@ ts sub@@ divide text into individual sentences . thus , only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , not the entire text order . thus , you can also skip or stop or stop orders on the card card orders , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not directly support this .
here you can see the set limit identi@@ fiers . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; a set limit identi@@ fier is set up automatically as a default . you can change its settings or add another set limit identi@@ fier , but it is recommended to beginners .
the easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out . switch off the choice of speakers and select text to read . switch on the list of speakers again , change some features and check how the speaker &apos;s choice is changed . of course , you need to have more than one speaker set up , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective .
&amp; kt@@ ts ; then proceed faster with reading , since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long ,
you can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the voice synthes@@ izer does not support this function .
for these reasons , the normal set limit identi@@ fier is automatically set up when you start t@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . change nothing to this filter unless you know what you are doing .
set limits Rec@@ og@@ nition filters compare text with a regular expression for typ@@ ing and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) . note that the default pro@@ posi@@ tional filter retains the character set .
S@@ BD filters will never be applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ notify ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers .
if you have removed the normal set limit identi@@ fier , you can insert it again by inviting the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c contained in &amp; kt@@ ts .
on the menu card reader selection , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application . the card card is displayed when
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card holder ) . in other words : no speaker features are defined .
use the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set features .
select the method to enter the desired language characteristics by clicking on one of the buttons .
select the characteristics of the desired speaker here . if this property does not matter , do not enter anything .
select this check box if the property has priority over other properties . you can also set multiple marks here .
since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before , if you know that a particular application will send text in a different language than the one in the working environment .
to use all the features in the area speaker , which is most likely to delete the following , click the default speaker select and then use the speaker that is most likely to meet the following .
in this case , 0 stands for the last text order in the queu@@ e . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the input 0 is required ) .
kt@@ ales m@@ gr immediately cras@@ hes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get track@@ ability .
G@@ Stre@@ amer is crash and crashed . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer yet . if the problem is not resolved by this , a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably installed . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer .
the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; ein . on the console ; appears a message stating : un@@ able to open PC@@ M .
there is a problem on your system that conflicts occur at AL@@ SA , which prevent simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . you can find hints for possible solutions on the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org .
I have uploaded an additional voice for festival from the internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ es@@ m@@ gr does not show this voice .
add the new voice in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / t@@ t@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / vocals . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers .
on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and can be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some synthesis modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card card for speaker devices . depending on the selected voice this is active or in@@ active .
the subscri@@ ber speed settings are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; - after @-@ SS@@ ML res@@ hap@@ ing filter , and set up the speaking speed .
I don &apos;t manage to read websites with a female voice . I &apos;ve set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
at festival 1.@@ 95 beta the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival doesn &apos;t produce any errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER @-@ tags to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber @-@ tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags .
I have added a separate string replace filter and now I can go to &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more on the top or back . on the tab assignments is displayed , the order only consists of one sentence . what do I do wrong ?
punc@@ tu@@ ation marks ( point , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be filtered . instead , use a filter for set limit recognition for these characters .

before using &amp; kt@@ ts ; first check if your voice synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer .
Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . for many voices you can adjust volume , speech speed and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts .
you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone .
for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . German voices are subject to restrictions on sharing .
this voice pres@@ umes Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / vocals / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voices MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ril@@ lic ( 8 bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . therefore , find the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech language , the option encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 .
if you want to use the Russian voice , the option encoding must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic like ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R .
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then Festival takes over lex@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; produces the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
please note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no full voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival generates these Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be created from German text di@@ phone .
in this process additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the Festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices to voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed at the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . instructions can be found under

this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; which allows managing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings .
the &amp; contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a unified , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center .
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf - package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the users :
after installation a new module network settings are displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network Network Set@@ ting in &amp; K@@ Menu ;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the device actually displays and allows setting of network properties .
in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version :
the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index is selected . when the module is started , it attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system .
if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and relay status . by selecting the setting non @-@ re @-@ en@@ qu@@ ire the definition can be made permanently . at the next start of the network settings , this selection will be set automatically .
changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . in the system management mode , you get by clicking the button system management mode at the bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password .
the entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode . it is divided into three tab@@ s :
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... in the Device Dialog .
by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to view the dialog with further options .
the automatic mode sel@@ ects the TCP / IP settings from a DH@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the DH@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information for each system start , so no further adjustment is required . in the selective list , either DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system .
the Man@@ ually option can be used without DH@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP the TCP / IP configuration . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the net@@ mask input field , the sub@@ net mask must be specified .
if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface on bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled .
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the Con@@ sole , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked .
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or turned off . switch on an out@@ dated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ...
depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or turned off . disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and de@@ activating Interface ....
specifies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which conve@@ ys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ nets .
if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located .
a host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org requests , DNS releases this name in an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 .
the name resolution calcul@@ ator part of the tag name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be ordered by selecting an entry or down@@ gra@@ ding in the list with the Hin@@ ds or Her@@ under buttons .
by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to the name resolution a DNS server can be added . it will be added to the New Name Server dialog .
first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list .
from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... It will display the Edit dialog .
the list of names in particular describes the host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily for bo@@ oting if there are no DNS servers available . in small closed networks , it can replace DNS servers .
usually , the list of names in particular contains some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv@@ 6 addresses . this still in the test version of IP will replace version 4 in future .
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... The New Ali@@ as dialog will be displayed .
enter the name of the well @-@ known computer and click Add the Add button . if the known computer has several alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names .
select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Un@@ known Calcul@@ ator is displayed .
it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts .
the settings made in the Network settings module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes must be done in a Con@@ sole ; the following command must be set .
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed .
the installation of the ready @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a Con@@ sole ; with rpm as follows :
alternatively , a tool with graphical interface such as k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used .
in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; in addition , the development packages are needed with libraries and others .
this is recommended to experienced users only . however , it is not difficult to compile and k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf ; the following commands should do this .
in the first section of this chapter you will find important information about basic network technology , in the second section all of the configuration files will be discussed by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf .
this section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small ( home ) network .
IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 ( IPv@@ 4 ) . IPv@@ 6 has never found widespread distribution . IPv@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this is why this description concentr@@ ates on the widespread IPv@@ 4 .
one of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point , which provides a valid IP address or , if available , can be used DH@@ CP . in any case , the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitr@@ arily !
when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore their arbitrary use is possible .
of course , access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway .
for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines .
in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 so that all machines are in the same sub@@ net .
some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first one is the so @-@ called default route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own calcul@@ ator ) . the default route is needed for IP forwarding .
the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address is assigned 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 to an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
in this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
this file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if in the event of active DSL connections , another content can be found than specified there .

recognizes &amp; k@@ dat , the pr@@ elo@@ ad , searches for the appropriate index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the tape index should be recre@@ ated .
if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape .
before throwing the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this :
&amp; dat ; by changing the symbol for the tape you see that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be disc@@ arded without danger .
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat .
a band type must be format@@ ted before you can use to save data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat . if your tape drive needs to be format@@ ted before using it , this must happen before you can format the tape from &amp; date . floppy @-@ tape drives usually require format@@ ting the tape , DA@@ T drives do not .
after entering the band name and the capacity , &amp; date , continue with the format of the tape . all data on the tape is lost ! after completing the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use .
before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can happen in three ways :
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are backed up .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save ...
once the backup has been initiated , the dialog opens settings for backup . in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup .
if you have confirmed the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time .
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Veri@@ fier ....
once the test procedure has been started , the dialog will appear for verification . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification .
if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
before you can re@@ establish the restore , the files that should be restored must be marked . this can be done in two ways :
select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the entry for the tape drive . it will only be restored to the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a check . only the files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
once the restore process has been started , the dialog will appear for restoration . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery .
if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will appear again . this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time .
sometimes it proves to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file on the basis of the contents of the tape . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this tape . you can create the index on two types of the volume :
this creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current working folder where the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder .
for all folders listed under backup files , only the files on the same file system are backed up like the folder . folders that are located on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent of the others .
perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since then .
the name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and created a new snapshot file for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
the settings can be set up using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must point to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape device .
if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat , before the tape is incorporated , the command mt load to the drive . for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed .
if the option is enabled , &amp; k@@ dat tries to lock the ej@@ ector at the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives .
if the option is enabled , it will be automatically dis@@ connected when releasing the &amp; k@@ dat file . do not use this option in floppy disks .
if the option is enabled , tries &amp; k@@ dat to change the hardware block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you have to communicate the block size for your tape drive .
if &amp; dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows :
( n Byte ) The format of this string is the host@@ name : seconds , where the host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds since the time the tape was format@@ ted .
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; Viewer for system logs . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ Log enables experienced users to access information about problems that occur on their server .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files .
in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ Log enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated .
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ esystem log ; functions are available with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual .
after launching , the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open . it will not be displayed to you , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you do not have to boot with system administrator rights . the log files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually do not have permission to read .
you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or by entered string . the list of the log lines is now automatically modified so that only log lines are displayed that match the selected filter . in the default setting , the selection box next to the filter will display the entry Show All . then a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included .
you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column . for example , in the protocol file system log , select the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all log @-@ lines that were sent or created by this process .
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important minutes lines . level errors are shown with a more eye @-@ catching color as minutes lines of the stage hint . the colored display of minutes lines can be switched off setup dialog .
if you only want to show a certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use the filter bar .
in addition , you can activate the Add to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added minutes lines .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows you to view multiple log files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub @-@ window , select a protocol to display .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. you will find more information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the directory of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ esystem log ; im &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Archive
welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v .
the system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of the program starts when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . that &apos;s why , because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it .
I will not go further into historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
the In@@ it binary is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone could try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and reform@@ at@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was one .
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following other folders :
in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically , you need a script for every system service that you want to start when running the system or switching to another run level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local .
r@@ c.@@ local should be on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run something with the serial port .
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one it finds .
the default run level is entered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can change / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you have mess@@ ed up , then you come back by re@@ bo@@ oting the system and exec@@ uting the following :
but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following :
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simply : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be inv@@ oked with the argument . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the argument start .
some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server run level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user run@@ level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , Network &amp; etc .
here you will learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter device is simple to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six run@@ levels to start it at this level ( or stop it ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else . the entry will be removed from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) . this will only happen if they remove an entry from the area of available system services .
note : entries are moved when you drag them into a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you have to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the contex@@ tual menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action .
the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be comp@@ uted . in such a case , you will need to edit the sort numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service .
note : currently there is no way to restore records that have been thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
you can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one .
to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cutting into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it into the desired Run@@ level with insert ( using C@@ trl ; V ) .
to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes .
because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed .
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise , they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
I have experim@@ ented with standard Run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly new . what can I do ?
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the Enter key to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be ok ) .
I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed .
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( DL@@ D ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution manual .
the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions simplifies the configuration of the proprietary setup programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach .
if you are using a different distribution , please check that all configuration files are available , which are needed by the respective system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg , Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) just end without message if their configuration files are not available or wrong .
the importance of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the runtime so that they can be added to this manual .
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read .
after you have made changes , you will need to save it . either you can use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save In the File menu .
the main window consists of two cards , the user group and the user@@ group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties .
some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space limitations ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created where you can set individual settings . other cards may appear , if shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed in BSD Uni@@ xes .
the tab card password management appears , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD UNIX .
this map only appears if for at least one fil@@ esystem space constra@@ int ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a user / quot@@ a group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here , parameters can be changed for each user , whereby the space limitations are given in KB :
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected by means of the field fil@@ esystem with limited space limitation .
the groups of cards are informed about the group affili@@ ations of the selected user . the standard group to which the user belongs , you will find in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can be a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the Properties dialog contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list .
to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work analog .
with this module , you can install the LI@@ LO boot@@ manager , add , remove and change the boot password , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , modify , and more .
