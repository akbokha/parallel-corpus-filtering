<seg id="1">The module website can be found in & konqueror; menu under Extras Website. select the source and target language of the translation from the drop-down list.</seg>
<seg id="2">If a part of the text is selected, only this part is translated to the location of the entire & URL.</seg>
<seg id="3">Machine translation is very rudimentary. babelfish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense. therefore, no important decisions are made dependent on the translations, without checking the translation beforehand.</seg>
<seg id="4">Only web pages on the Internet can be translated. other texts should be translated to the Babelfish page itself, where you can insert the texts you want to translate.</seg>
<seg id="5">The package & package; contains various modules for & konqueror; despite its small size, they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of & konqueror; by making them easier available.</seg>
<seg id="6">Further information on the use of & konqueror; and the built-in functions can be found in the manual & konqueror;</seg>
<seg id="7">To load these modules in & konqueror, select Settings extensions.... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want.</seg>
<seg id="8">This is a list of standard installation modules from the box kde; addons. please note that any more modules on your system are installed, if you have additional software installed.</seg>
<seg id="9">You should install the kdebase package, the & konqueror; contains before you compile this package.</seg>
<seg id="10">To use the crash module, click in & konqueror; on Tools crashes. then you can view the page, the & konqueror; to crash, or the list of crashes, if available, delete.</seg>
<seg id="11">The module View Filters (also called Folder Filters) can be found in the & konqueror menu. the module allows you to filter & konqueror; 's current working directory in different ways.</seg>
<seg id="12">To view the DOM tree view in & konqueror, select Tools DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the page displayed. as default, the display begins with the root node of the document, for example: documenta element, all other nodes are sub-elements of this root node.</seg>
<seg id="13">The module & FSView; for & konqueror; provides another view for objects with the MIME-Type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The peculiarity of & FSView; consists of nesting nested order hierarchies with the help of a so-called tree map. tree-Maps indicate the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle, whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">With & FSView, the size is the size of a file or folder, with the size of a folder as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be recognized even if it is located far below in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you will be considered.</seg>
<seg id="16">In & FSView, an entry in the Treemap display is a rectangle representing a file or folder in your filesystem. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings.</seg>
<seg id="17">The color of a rectangle that is switched over view color mode can be either depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the picture of another file property, such as name, owner, group or MIME type.</seg>
<seg id="18">A rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the respective file or folder. for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space for representation (and therefore display errors may occur due to restrictions in the sign of the Treemap). moreover, you can set the relative position of the label in the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="19">For Treemap's presentation algorithms, the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. in the Treemap in & FSView, this target is not always complied with. it is drawn boxes to indicate the nesting of entries, and this frame will need space, which is then lost to the subordinate entries.</seg>
<seg id="20">As splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left, the implementation is left up. here it is necessary to divide the areas so that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recursive branches.</seg>
<seg id="21">You can set the minimum displayed area for an entry on the menu item View Pertaining on Area. instead, a space pattern is drawn into the area of the parent input to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry.</seg>
<seg id="22">Originally & FSView; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget designed for the application KCachegrind.</seg>
<seg id="23">The module image gallery can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras Image Gallery... or by Ctrl; I.</seg>
<seg id="24">When you visit the Image Gallery module, a dialog opens, allowing you to set the image of the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="25">The title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field.</seg>
<seg id="26">The option images per line has a slider and a turn panel to set the number of thumbnails in each line in the gallery.</seg>

<seg id="32">With the check box subfolder, you can set a slide bar or a set of rotation to which level the subfolders will be included.</seg>
<seg id="33">Copy original images with the check boxes, determine if the original images are to be copied to the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="34">Using the comment file's check box, you can specify a comment file for captioning images in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="35">In the check box Custom color depth, you can set a different color depth for the thumbnails than in the original pictures.</seg>
<seg id="36">The Module & HTML; Settings provides easy access to the general & HTML; settings for & konqueror;.</seg>
<seg id="37">The Module & HTML; Settings can be found in the & konqueror; menu under Extras HTML Settings. the following behavior of the web browser can be specified here:</seg>

<seg id="39">To play, click the & konqueror navigation pane; and drag the music files you want to hear in the media playback.</seg>
<seg id="40">Change browser recognition inserts a menu entry in & konqueror; in addition to which you can change browser and OS detection for individual domains. this is useful for web pages that allow access only with certain browsers.</seg>
<seg id="41">The default browser detection of the & konqueror; is Mozilla / 5.0 (compatible; Konqueror / 3.3; Linux) (KHTML, like Gecko). if you come to a web page that refuses to access this browser, change the browser detection in one of the following options.</seg>
<seg id="42">Changes the identifier in MSIE for pages that deny access to browsers on the basis of Mozilla. for example, you need the MSIE browser recognition to call with & konqueror; Hotmail.</seg>
<seg id="43">Pages that do not correspond to the W3C standard or the own & HTML; elements and attributes are displayed correctly with the identification of this deprecated browser.</seg>

<seg id="55">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digities.more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, every medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="56">& digitized; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools. you can use them to view, comment, evaluate and correct your photos. the editing capabilities can be easily expanded using KDE Image Plugins Interface (manual) modules.</seg>
<seg id="57">Although & digitized; easy to use, it provides dozens of professional skills. it works fully in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the raw conversion using libraw, DNG export and ICC colour management workflow.</seg>
<seg id="58">Improved database with much more metadata, such as & eg; via the camera or lens that can be searched.</seg>
<seg id="59">Like all & kde; programs are also & digitized; an open source project. that means it depends on the support of the end users. therefore, you should report problems and improvements.</seg>
<seg id="60">This opens a dialog with an underlined shortcut. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. if you use these links, your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system. all the information you need is already registered here. just follow the instructions to send your report.</seg>
<seg id="61">& digikam; is a project supported by a community. that means the user and developer can help each other. if you are a regular user of & digikam; then we would like to ask you questions about other users of & digikam; however, in this mailing list, English is spoken, you should therefore be powerful in this language.</seg>
<seg id="62">You can also visit the digicam; homepage visit to learn more about released versions and other information about & digiplug; to learn.</seg>
<seg id="63">The best start to participate in & digitized; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list. instructions to login in the developer mailing list of & digikam;.</seg>
<seg id="64">When you start & edit; for the first time, you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database. you can specify a local, remote or remote folder here. simply enter the path name or click the Folder icon icon to select a folder.</seg>
<seg id="65">In the second field, you will need to specify a local folder on your computer. here, the data storage is saved. this path remains the same for all image folders.</seg>
<seg id="66">Later you can add as many folders as you want. & digiplug; you will additionally use as an Albenbibliothek. settings digiKam setting up collections</seg>
<seg id="67">If you already have a picture collection on your hard drive, you can specify the top folder that contains images as base folder. & digicame; regards each subfolder as an album. no image will be changed. while searching the folders, you will see a progress indicator like this:</seg>
<seg id="68">& digitized; secures recursively the library path in its full depth. you cannot exclude sub-folders unless it is iste in hidden folders. this can be done by inserting one point in front of the name of the subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="69">If you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder, you will notice that the albums in My Albenliste do not have photos as symbols. you can change them by taking any photo from the album and placing it on the folder icon.</seg>
<seg id="70">Once you have configured the base folder, you can get in & digiplug; set up your digital camera. then you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums.</seg>
<seg id="71">If you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported shell cameras in the Help RohkameraBackup.</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh-Decoder Options and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">An easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digities.more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, every medium and card reader that is supported by your operating system will work with & digiplug; work together.</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transmission to the computer, the camera is often used as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives.</seg>
<seg id="75">Digiplug; uses the program gPhoto2 for communication with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, redistributable software collection for digital cameras, which supports a steadily increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need of additional drivers.</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos are generally large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow, this connection is now obsolete. & digikam; supports these cameras and performs the transmission of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">Libgphoto2 has to be created with libexif support so that the thumbnails of digiKam can be read reliably. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things about & digitized; is how easy it can expand its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE Image Plugins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digitized;, Photoalbum, Shovimg and Gwenview. the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs.</seg>
<seg id="80">Modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as it can also be a user. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digitized; by writing a small module to add a function as the changes were made in & digiplug; even perform.</seg>
<seg id="81">To simplify the window, you can either remove the sidebars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F.</seg>
<seg id="82">Drag and drop images works everywhere: you can put a picture in another part of the Albenbauma, above the horizontal divider line or in another application window. the only restriction is that an image cannot be stored in keywords, dates list or search.</seg>
<seg id="83">- a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. thus filtering on the file name only works if this ind is displayed in the symbol view. which fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the Alb settings.</seg>
<seg id="85">The View & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view of your photo albums. all photos stored by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which they were stored on the hard disk, after the name of their collection in the legacy properties or after the date on which the album was first created.</seg>
<seg id="86">If you have set up a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. select Import Photos to scan. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album. select Import screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="87">To copy or move a picture from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse onto the target album and drop it. in the pop-up menu you need to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album.</seg>
<seg id="88">An album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to click with the right mouse button on the album and edit the album properties in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="89">Album- Collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection used by you will be used to sort your photos by selecting from the toolbar or view albums sorted by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do so in the collections options.</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">The eldest, average, new: these set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the passage of the album. this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, instead, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder.</seg>
<seg id="92">When you first get an album in & digiplug; open, the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="93">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click the image with the right mouse button and select in the context menu & quot; As an album preview. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can always be included only in one collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digitized; supports the input of keywords for individual photos in the section My keyword list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. the collection always includes all photos of the album. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">The image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all images in this album are displayed in the picture window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview using the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="97">When you open an album for the first time, you have to wait for a while while the thumbnails are generated. this allows you to avoid using the Tools Show all thumbnails in the Tools menu.</seg>
<seg id="98">Information on each picture is displayed below the associated preview. which information is, you can change about settings digitized; change the albums page here and adjust the area thumbnails to your wishes.</seg>
<seg id="99">The thumbnails have help windows that appear. the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a picture. the screen shot at the top of the section Introduction to the main window shows such an auxiliary window.</seg>
<seg id="100">Photos are everything about & digitized; go. albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you. image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this. you can choose any of the features that come with & digiplug; you can choose between viewing the images, a slide show or editing the images.</seg>
<seg id="101">You can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F4 Image Edit... or the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit... Select a guide on how to edit your photos. with image editing, you can view your photos and change them.</seg>
<seg id="102">It can happen that & digikam; the functionality you need is not available. you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type submenu. the applications listed there will be checked by the & kde; file assignments for the file type.</seg>
<seg id="103">You should note that after processing other image processing programs, it is possible to avoid problems with the metadata that is included in the image. some programs do not store this data when you save the modified image. thus, this information is lost from the EXIF and IPTC data such as orientation, aperture etc.</seg>
<seg id="104">& digiplug; provides two possibilities for rotation. the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview pane to select and rotate. in the submenu you can specify the degree of rotation.</seg>
<seg id="105">To change the file name of a photo, right-click on the preview and select F2 Rename from the context menu. note that you keep the extension (.jpg, .tif, & etc;).</seg>
<seg id="106">If you delete a photo from & drop, it will be moved to the garbage bin of & kde; moved. F8 Picture Delete or Del if you prefer to really delete, you can use this by using Shift; Del.</seg>
<seg id="107">The View & quot; My Datumlimit & quot; organizes your photos using the data. & digitised; uses either the EXIF date or if it is not available, the date of last modification of the file.</seg>
<seg id="108">If you select a month from the list, all photos of this month will be shown in the image view. you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view so that only the photos of the selected days will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="109">Photos with keywords provided provides a flexible and powerful way to organize and catalog your photos. tags are stickers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups. once a keyword has been assigned to a photo, the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search again.</seg>
<seg id="110">When a keyword is selected, all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="111">Keywords can be sorted in a hierarchical tree. this allows you to organize your keywords logically. you can also easily find parts of the tree & quot; My keyword stays & quot; so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for.</seg>
<seg id="112">The keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IPTC data fields of the image, at least for JPEG. so you can also use your keywords in other programs. in addition, the keywords will be re-imported when & digitized; the pictures notice.</seg>
<seg id="113">You can add new keywords by clicking on & quot; My keyword; or click on an existing keyword and then select New keyword. if you have clicked a new keyword, after clicking on an existing keyword, this keyword will be the keyword of this keyword.</seg>
<seg id="114">You can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and select Delete. if you delete a keyword, the photo itself will not be deleted. only the keyword is removed from this photo.</seg>
<seg id="115">You can change the position of a keyword by dragging it to the desired position in the tree and put it down there. then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to move the keyword. a keyword can be at a time only once in a tree.</seg>
<seg id="116">You can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and edit the keyword in the context menu. you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree & quot; My keyword;</seg>
<seg id="117">To select another photo as an album icon, you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and select As Album Show in the context menu. in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="118">To be able to use keywords, you must first provide your photos with keywords. this can happen in two ways: once you have selected the photos you are looking for with a keyword, you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree & quot; My keyword. alternatively, you can also click with the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keyword to assign to the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="119">You can add a photo with any number of keywords. the photo will be displayed once you select one of the keywords assigned to it. in this way you can give a keyword for each person on a photo, one for the place where the photo was made, one for the event where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="120">Once you have provided a photo with keywords, this will be shown in the main window under the thumbnail.</seg>
<seg id="121">You can remove a keyword with the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select Remove from the Tags menu. the menu only shows you the keywords assigned to the photo.</seg>
<seg id="122">The time beam view shows a time-dependent adjustment of the number of images per time unit. a selection frame can be moved over this histogram. to select a time frame you just have to click on the bottom rectangle of the selection box that displays the time unit.</seg>
<seg id="123">In the field below, you can enter a title and save your selection. it then appears in the list below.</seg>
<seg id="124">Includes all elements of the database: names, reviews, keywords, keywords, albums, collections, date stamps, and in the future even more.</seg>
<seg id="125">Next to the search box is a small light that will find the green when the search finds hits. if you click here, the filtering will be deleted and all the pictures will be displayed again. if the search has not found anything, then the lamp will be red.</seg>
<seg id="126">The more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left sidebar with binoculars. if you open this you get a simple search box like the one described above. you can save this search here but as a live search, which always filters what you have entered as search criterion. after you have saved it appears the filter in the list.</seg>
<seg id="127">If you are satisfied with your selection, press the head OK and the search will be performed. the results will be displayed in my search list in the main window. if you want to change your search again, you just need to select the corresponding entry from my search list and select an option in its context menu.</seg>
<seg id="128">If you select to edit search, the search will appear again with the search information you entered. if you select an advanced search, the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search. more information can be found in the Advanced Search section.</seg>
<seg id="129">If you want to delete an existing search from the list, select Delete in the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="130">The Advanced search will provide you with an extended search form with many search parameters that you can search in certain fields of & digitised; s database.</seg>
<seg id="131">The list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Albian database. each option can be added or deleted by operators. each option can be added to this list by means of logical operations All..., One..., No... or At least... You can create searches of type & quot; AND NICHTquot;.</seg>
<seg id="132">& digitized; characterizes each image by a long number with a special technique, the hair algorithm. this makes it possible to compare images by comparing these signatures. the less the difference between two image signatures, the more they correspond. this technique is applied in three areas.</seg>
<seg id="133">Similar entries: this is an area in which you can drop each picture to find a similar. by means of a Schwellert, the selection of results can be enlarged or reduced. if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the unused search in the left sidebar, then it will open and you can drop it there.</seg>
<seg id="134">Sketch: hands-free colour sketches: draw a quick sketch and digiplug; find the right pictures. also here, a threshold value can be set.</seg>
<seg id="135">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it down and move it. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="136">In the field below, you can specify a name for your geo filter. this will then be added for later use of the list below. it works like a live geo folder.</seg>
<seg id="137">& digitized; provides an illuminated table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images. it works with all supported image file formats, also raw files, together.</seg>
<seg id="138">Select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use Ctrl; L To add the luminaire from the contextual menu. the selection will be added to the illuminated table and its window opened. if you are back in & digiplug; main window, you can quickly open the illuminated table with L Extras illuminated table.</seg>
<seg id="139">From the preview bar, you can drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window. if you select a preview of the toolbar and carry out zoo or move operations on one of the pictures, then you can also compare them with the other image. you can therefore compare the same area of the two pictures.</seg>
<seg id="140">Another mode is better suited to quickly fade out of a series of images. if you navigate in pairs from the toolbar, then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for comparisons. use the left mouse button on any thumbnail to display it on the left side. this makes it easier to work through a series of similar images.</seg>
<seg id="141">Of course, the normal delete actions also work directly from the lighting table, such as F4 file editing....</seg>
<seg id="142">All image information from the right side of the main window is available for both thumbnails in the illuminated table. this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data.</seg>
<seg id="143">At the bottom of each section you will find a built-in swivel function that you can recognize on the crossed arrows. to pivoting the visible area of the image, you need to click them and hold the & LMB; then both images will show the same image area.</seg>
<seg id="144">The zoom works just like in other views. simply use the zoom knob under the pictures or Ctrl; mouse wheel to zoom in and out. this happens in both images when previewing in the preview mode.</seg>
<seg id="145">What is a digital stock management - away from the fashion word? digital inventory management considers every part of the process after the image has been taken until the final issue and permanent storage. each of the photos absorbs, scans or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management. most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way.</seg>
<seg id="146">We give you a tool, a plan and practical tips how to back up your pictures, find, protect and use photos again. we focus on downloading, renaming, removing, converting, grouping, securing, evaluating, supporting, archiving, optimizing, waiting and exporting image files.</seg>
<seg id="147">& quot; Digitale Stock Manager accepts, indexed, categorizes, secures, searches, transforms, assemble and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value.</seg>
<seg id="148">Metadata is defined as data about data. metadata is in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or documentation of other data managed by an application or environment.</seg>
<seg id="149">I venture to claim if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer, then you do not even need to find a certain photo without stock management. if you do not even know how many photos you have, then you certainly do not use & digiplug;. the approach to store metadata in both a database and image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving on which you can freely access with other programs, platforms and formats.</seg>
<seg id="150">The first thing you need to do and know before you install anything into your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you have to decide if other access to your photos is to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive & etc.</seg>
<seg id="151">You may be happy with this structure. holiday rentals can be found quickly over your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, then you will be subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images that you print or publish on a website.</seg>
<seg id="152">Professional photographers have different requirements, e.g. versioning of photos, archiving, workflows, constant supply of images on different topics and a large number of everything. within 10 years 95% Archives and 5% working files will have and you will then not want to reorganize your structure for this content.</seg>
<seg id="153">What kinds of files fit together? separation of file types makes batch processing easier. separate new from old files.</seg>
<seg id="154">The separation of original and working files simplifies a backup strategy and migration. you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image.</seg>
<seg id="155">We also recommend that EXIF and IPTC data are entered into the file in the Settings page. this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written to the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate point in the Album menu.</seg>
<seg id="156">Now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones? to do so, you have to add a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes. these are of course the most important ones.</seg>
<seg id="157">Now the real work starts, because you should now assign keywords, captions and an evaluation to any photo. of course, you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos during the further work.</seg>
<seg id="158">Let us now use keywords, keywords, as you often want to use in other programs, or categories. all three are synonyms for the same thing.</seg>
<seg id="159">If you import catalogued images from another source with embedded keywords, then you will automatically create the tree for you or insert the images to the right place. sorting the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dragging a subtree to another. the changed keywords are edited by & digitised; updated as it tracks the subtrees.</seg>
<seg id="160">The graph shows how different metadata is overlapping. this is a very coarse representation as each block of metadata is in truth from many sections. filenames and calendar data are properties of all images.</seg>
<seg id="161">Enough of the keywords - the next section refers to lettering or comments, the third important tool to catalog your metadata.</seg>
<seg id="162">You don't want anyone to see your photos just, you want to share them with your friends, your family, other photographers and agencies. you're sure to be interested in your photos.</seg>
<seg id="163">Look at this panorama. from the distance is not even a nice beach panorama. if you look at it closer, you start to see some details, people, the place.</seg>
<seg id="164">And now I tell you that this is the landing field of the Allies & quot; Omaha Beachquot; in the French Normandy 60 years after landing. wow! you start dreaming to have associations, memories, the historical period is present again, you may even hear the silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">For others who consider your photos the title may be more important than the picture itself to create an interest. if you show pictures you should tell a story. remember, the key is to transfer the meaning to the viewer to help Him understand what you understand.</seg>
<seg id="166">It is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength to work only with a lettering for itself alone.</seg>
<seg id="167">With & digiplug; you can save as much text, in an internationalized alphabet (UTF-8), as a caption. if you export your images in web galleries, then these labels will be exported to your preferences in the lettering and / or the title of the web gallery system.</seg>
<seg id="168">Remember the times before GPS? when you had to find a different city without navigation system? was it not a boring planet in front of GoogleEarth? well, because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now travels with speed of light.</seg>
<seg id="169">The possibilities of using geolocation are already countless and will become even deeper in the future. I am sure that one day, in the near future, you can virtually repeat your trips by using pictures with Geographical Information. you can also export kml files that you can open with GoogleEarth. you can also export the pictures to Gallery2, Picasaweb, Flickr & etc; with the GoogleMaps viewer.</seg>
<seg id="170">& quot; Copyleft is a word game with copyright and denotes the practice of using copyrights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies. the same freedoms are also valid in all changed versions, so also for the work of others.</seg>
<seg id="171">The following description tells you which information in the setup page of & digikam; as information should be stored:</seg>
<seg id="172">Author (synonym for creator and author): this field should contain your name, or the name of the person who created the photo. if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer, e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer, then the name of a company or organization can be used. this field does not support commas or semicolons as separator.</seg>
<seg id="173">Author title (synonym for author's line): associated with the author. this field contains the job title of the photographer. examples of this can be titles such as: employee photographer, freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer. since this is a comment on the author's field, this must be filled out as well.</seg>
<seg id="174">Publisher (synonym for suppliers): use the provider field to identify who offers the photo. this does not necessarily have to be the author. if the photographer works for a news agency such as Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations can be listed here that you provide the picture to others.</seg>
<seg id="175">It is very important to fill the author and copyright sections, even though they have no protection against abuse. anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or modify them in the image. for private individuals this is very important for the majority of your photos. for professionals and semi-professionals, this protection is very important.</seg>
<seg id="176">The digital watermark is unique per image. & digitized; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="177">Topics: disk failure, disk failure, power surgeons, ECC, transmission errors, aging of the storage media, restoration, redundancy, disaster prevention, life time, temperature, data size, widened superstitions</seg>
<seg id="178">Of course we don't talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or on a fire. these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or negatives. in this section you will find problems with the so-called New Media.</seg>
<seg id="179">Kroll onTRACK, the world's largest data recovery company, has some interesting statistics which causes data loss.</seg>
<seg id="180">To combat the problem with CDs / DVDs these must be treated prudently and you may not be trusted for longer than a couple of years. of course, you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer, harder to get and much more expensive. there are offers about gold coated DVDs, & dollar; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years.</seg>
<seg id="181">CD / DVD discs can be unreadable, but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way. the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write a lot more reliable.</seg>
<seg id="182">CDs and DVDs are very susceptible to errors, even if they have just been written. that's why they use a control sum mechanism to protect themselves. 75% of the data are only effective data, the rest we need for formatting and checksums. despite this massive protection, they age through chemical aging, ultraviolet light, scratches, dust & etc;</seg>
<seg id="183">For defective CDs and DVDs, there is a good program called IsoBuster which apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs. it runs under Windows and & Linux; but is not yet available for Macs. there are also similar applications to read damaged disks from damaged disks, hard disks, flash media, USB drives, etc.</seg>
<seg id="184">Optical media: Blu-ray disks appear to win the format war against the HD DVD. a dual layer Blu-ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB. all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for Blu-ray disc.</seg>
<seg id="185">Burn slowly with a good recording device on high quality media in a non-propriated format. then read the media with a description, date & author and then store it in a clean, dark dry and protected spot. do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before reading the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media.</seg>
<seg id="186">Discards retain your statistics for themselves. their manufacturer's products include a new disk, but not the data. Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this subject: disk failure study</seg>
<seg id="187">The most common cause of error, SMART, is the most common cause of error. electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of error, SMART cannot determine this error. some of SMART's errors are the most common cause of failure.</seg>
<seg id="188">This is only the complete loss due to overvoltage. of course, you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have saved the files, but these losses can normally be restored without major problems.</seg>
<seg id="189">While most electric devices don't matter much, this is different for devices with computer chips and high speed processors. these can cause serious damage. on your computer, these anomalies can cause serious keyboards, complete data loss, hardware aging, destroyed motherboards and other defects. so protect yourself from the unavoidable that leads to a loss of time and money.</seg>
<seg id="190">The most common protection against current peaks is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy heat and grooves the rest. it is usually available in the form of a plug connector. however, remember that not every connector bar also contains overvoltage protection.</seg>
<seg id="191">If you are looking for an overvoltage protection, you should make sure that it meets the UL 1449 standard, which guarantees a certain minimum of protection. you should also take care that it provides protection against lightning strikes and thus protects the properly connected devices.</seg>
<seg id="192">Since an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected. this also applies to telephone lines and cable modems as well. some manufacturers provide overvoltage protection, which also includes a phone connection for your modem. others offer connection options for the coaxial cable of the cable modems and the television card.</seg>
<seg id="193">If you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially developed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem.</seg>
<seg id="194">While an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterrupted power supply.</seg>
<seg id="195">In addition to protecting from overvoltages, these devices can automatically provide battery energy when a power outage occurs. this gives you the possibility to store your data and run the system in order. if you buy a UPS, you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. in addition, the lifetime of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting.</seg>
<seg id="196">Consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare your safety in case of power failure with the cost of avoiding these. a high-quality overvoltage protection can get you up to & euro; 20. this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected with it. finally, you should always remember all the cables before going to the holiday.</seg>
<seg id="197">The Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service. with the right configuration you can mount it as a drive under & Linux;, Mac, and Windows. this allows you to use it as backup destination for your software. Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data.</seg>
<seg id="198">You are however very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB costs & dollars; 75 per year and 400 GB costs & dollars; 500. in addition, you need to send the data on the comparatively slow internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important images. it is not a bad solution, but it is not a general backup solution.</seg>
<seg id="200">Picasaweb (Google), Flickr (Yahoo) and the photo community 23hq.com provide online storage services that are fed to photos. your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online. for $25 per year you get unlimited storage, which should only be checked in reality.</seg>
<seg id="201">From the point of view of data backup, the web solutions are very safe. transmission errors are automatically cleaned thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed memory.</seg>
<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transfers are vulnerable to transfer errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between the operating system and the hard disk.</seg>
<seg id="203">The worst thing about this is that no one tells you when a transfer error occurred, not when this occurred in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undetected until you have been destroyed one day. it is quite disturbing that there is no protection in your computer. no one ever seems to have thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer.</seg>
<seg id="204">Unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interest within the data streams. in normal file systems, these errors remain unnoticed.</seg>
<seg id="205">Even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems, you should look into the future. already in 2010, you will see thousands of errors a year.</seg>
<seg id="206">ZFS from Sun Microsystems seems to be one of two candidates who can deal with disk failures on a low level and are highly scalable. it is open source, with many patents and is available under a GPL incompatible license for Solaris and Leopard. we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux and Windows.</seg>
<seg id="207">Oracle has started its own initiative with its btrfs filesystem. this is still in alpha-status. it uses the same protective mechanisms using ZFS and is also available for & Linux; however, it is not yet part of the kernel.</seg>
<seg id="208">Do not underestimate this! these two factors are responsible for 86% of data losses in the notebook and 46% at the workstation systems. in notebooks, the proportion of theft is 50%.</seg>
<seg id="209">Data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think. it leads to lower damage such as theft or new installations. and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems; Apple users only know very few viruses and under & Linux; no longer has been sighted for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="210">Open source file systems are less susceptible to data loss as proprietary systems: wrong, NTFS is minimal better than ext3, ReiserFS, JFs and XFS to name the most common filesystems.</seg>
<seg id="211">Journaling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss: untrue, only the speed of the investigation process at a sudden interruption during an operation is higher and an undefined status is avoided. however, if a file has not been completely stored before the problem occurred, it is lost.</seg>
<seg id="212">Viruses are the greatest threat to digital data: wrong, theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss.</seg>
<seg id="213">Sensors from digital cameras are 1-2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits. this means that while the technology continues to develop there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>
<seg id="214">Today's cameras go towards 10 megapixel sensors. even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more likely to deteriorate. even DSLR cameras have your border at 10-12 megapixels. even DSLR cameras have your border at 10-12 megapixels. for higher resolutions you need a full-format sensor (24x36mm) or larger formats.</seg>
<seg id="215">You get a 750GB hard drive today for 100 & euro; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss. so you often backup your data according to a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous as the reinstallation of your operating system, the exchange of disks or the size change of hard drives.</seg>
<seg id="216">Suppose you make your backups on an external SATA drive every day. if, then one day, a flash will hit you if the drive wasn't connected right now.</seg>
<seg id="217">A disaster hits local and destroys a lot. forget aircraft fragments: fire, water, electricity, children and theft are dangerous enough for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house.</seg>
<seg id="218">Therefore, desaster prevention always means a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs into the neighbour house, into your office or similar.</seg>
<seg id="219">There is another advantage of physical separation: as stated above is a common reason for data loss despite backing up the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day.</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differentiation: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. creates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete backup and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. create multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time at which such a backup is made. this backup comes with a versioning system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not running.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts, rsync only copies the difference of the files that have really been changed. this happens compacted and if you want to increase security via ssh.</seg>
<seg id="224">Save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer on a DVD or other optical medium.</seg>
<seg id="225">This approach lets you get enough time to detect and restore losses. at the same time you come for backup but with & lt; 130% of the size of the working files. in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7-14 days, a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month.</seg>
<seg id="226">Topics: metadata stored in the image file stored IPTC information, associated XMP files, original retain, memory, scalability, media, reinventing images and metadata, copying images to the next generation of media, applications, operating systems, virtualization, visual equipment,..., use of the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="227">So that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth, there are two strategies that should be considered:</seg>
<seg id="228">As the future is unpredictable because of your nature, you have to consider all that is being said today with caution and re-evaluate during the time. unfortunately, there is no other way to foretell certain vigilance. every 5-8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backward compatible. the less variants you used in the past, the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future.</seg>
<seg id="229">This question should be answered by means of explanations in this document. use or change to open standards supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is now available for everyone. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures, keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">On the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, storage and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and convert if necessary to a newer standard. stay with open standards.</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have planned scalability and have placed the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. with * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and relocate it to a new disk:</seg>
<seg id="234">Check with the command dmesg if your new record has been detected by the system, but don't hang it.</seg>
<seg id="235">/ dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdb [#] of = / dev / sdc # source is / dev / sdc & dollars; parted resize / dev / sdc1 0 & lt; size of disk in MBs; # works with ext2.3, FAT16, 32 and reiserfs & dollars; resize2fs / dev / sdc1 # change the size of the drive if needed</seg>
<seg id="236">Open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification. even if one day no more software can read it, then you can create it yourself. this task will be easier from year to year.</seg>
<seg id="237">GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="238">PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace the GIF. it can save much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16 bits per color channel and full transparency. the disadvantage is that there is relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF requires and a slow compression.</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely distributed as image format. TIFF may be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality, but requires very large files. a problem is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The Digitale Negative File Format is a royalty-free and open-format image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG has been developed based on the need to unify the camera's formats. it is now available on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to using metadata.</seg>
<seg id="241">This may be one of the reasons why to replace Adobe its XML based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot; technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. it is a label technology that allows users to embed their data into a file itself.</seg>
<seg id="242">Many photographers prefer to archive an original of your recording, mostly in the raw format. XMP works as it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can lead to problems when linking between the metadata file and the image file, and as mentioned above, the raw format is switched off. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put it together.</seg>
<seg id="243">The Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization supporting fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI's activities include work on architecture and modelling, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and the DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices.</seg>
<seg id="244">Import images from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera edium, you can use it as temporary fuse.</seg>
<seg id="245">Convert raw files to DNG and save them to your raw archive. this function is not yet implemented.</seg>
<seg id="246">You can use external programs for a fine-layered processing. if you edit the images again with & digiplug; edit, then you should add the metadata again. these have been cut off by the other programs.</seg>
<seg id="247">Protect the processed images for copyright with a digital watermark. first export them to web galleries, code in MPEG, use in contact sheets, print & etc;</seg>
<seg id="248">The camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in & digiplug; to get. in the Adding a Photo to an Album, you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive. however, the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for importing images to your legacy database.</seg>
<seg id="249">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, connect it to the computer, turn the camera to the display mode and turn it on. a further description can be found in the manual of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="250">When you start the camera interface, it tries to connect to your camera. if the connection is made, a hey indicator appears at the bottom and the thumbnails of all photos on the camera are displayed. if this is the case, the file names and a symbol are displayed for each file, photos, movies, music, etc. on the camera.</seg>
<seg id="251">Before you download the photos on your computer, you may need the camera information for each entry. with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata.</seg>
<seg id="252">This dialog displays file properties and photo information stored internally by the camera. a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer. note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available.</seg>
<seg id="253">The Metadata tab displays the internal metadata such as Exif, manufacturer notice, GPS, etc. this information is the same as in the metadata sidebar from the main window of & digikam; or image processing. note that these metadata is not available for some digital cameras.</seg>
<seg id="254">The easiest way to download photos on your computer is by clicking on the Download button and then downloading the All. this loads all photos from your camera into a single album in & digikam;. when downloading, the photos are not deleted and we advise you to check if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera.</seg>
<seg id="255">If you do not want to download all of the photos, you can only select the chosen ones with the default selection methods from & kde; as soon as you have selected the photos, use the download button and download the chosen ones. download the selected button as long as you have selected some photos.</seg>
<seg id="256">If your camera supports this, an option New downloadable is available. these pictures have not yet been edited by & digiplug; downloaded. in this case, the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window. if you select this option, only the new pictures are downloaded.</seg>
<seg id="257">When you download the buttons All download or download Selected, a dialog appears where you can select the target album in which the photos are stored. the list of existing albums is displayed in the My Albums section. then select the target album from the list and click OK.</seg>
<seg id="258">After selecting the target album, press OK, and & digiplug; download the photos from the camera to the album.</seg>
<seg id="259">Once you have downloaded the photos you have downloaded, you can delete them from the camera. you can delete them all at once by deleting the Delete button. if you just want to delete some, you have to select them first and then delete the chosen ones.</seg>
<seg id="260">Please note that there is no way to restore the photos you have deleted from the camera. so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded in a & digiplug; you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted; if you want to completely delete the camera finder, you should do so via the camera menu, as this is much faster.</seg>
<seg id="261">Cameras often do not use meaningful names for the photos. the filenames are normally recycled after the photos have been deleted from the camera. this can lead to double file names if you upload photos from different cradles to the same album. therefore, it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been taken into the file name.</seg>
<seg id="262">In the next section you will find options for rotating and mirroring the image and for file-based ombs. if you use this latter option, a folder will be created automatically per day.</seg>
<seg id="263">The options During the transfer will open three more options that will be performed before the photos are stored on the disk. the first two will concern the data about the author in the Standard AutoriIdentity section. if you select this, the corresponding entries are copied from the Exif information into the IPTC fields. with the last option you can correct date & time for all downloaded images.</seg>
<seg id="264">If you wish another date format than the standard format, you can, for example, use the prefix photo- to y-% m-% d% H:% M:% S. to do so, turn the option Date & Time. for further adjustments, you should read the help of the strftime command.</seg>
<seg id="265">If you are using the option camera file name, you have the option to change the file names in lowercase letters. or in capital letters if you prefer.</seg>
<seg id="266">The new file name, which & digitised; used for a photo, is displayed below the name that the camera provides in preview. your settings for renaming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time.</seg>
<seg id="267">& digiplug; can use all the information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform automatic rotation during shutdown. not all cameras provide this information. in the Metadata section, you can read more details about the information your camera has embedded in the photo.</seg>
<seg id="268">The automatic rotation is usually turned on, and if your camera doesn't supply this information, you can get digitised; the photo in the original orientation. if you want to turn off the automatic turn, use the Advanced button and select the automatic spin in the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="269">If your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available, & digicame; this is used to automatically download sub-albums in the target album by downloading. all images with the same date are loaded into the same subalbum. not all cameras provide this information. in the Meta data section you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos.</seg>
<seg id="270">This option is usually disabled, and in this case, & digiplug; the photos directly in the target album. if you want to change this, you have to turn on this option. use the Advanced button and select the date-based subtitle at the bottom of the window.</seg>
<seg id="271">The easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the Download button. then select Upload. the file selection dialog & kde; appears where you can select the files that should be uploaded. you can also select more than one file with the default & kde; methods.</seg>
<seg id="272">After the image selection is done, ask & digiplug; you where the images are to be uploaded. a folder selection dialog for the camera appears. select here the desired folder and press OK to start the upload. the images will not be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="273">GPS (Global Positioning System) is used as a general term in this document. this refers to a position indicated in length and width and which can be displayed on a map. the determination of the data can be performed by the American GPS, the Russian GLONAS, the European GALILEO or any other system.</seg>
<seg id="274">Not only for professional photographers, it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location. not everyone uses a plane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data. environmental planners, military, police, architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability.</seg>
<seg id="275">If you later forgot where exactly the photo was made, you can open a browser that displays the area. if you want to send a postcard to another & digiplug; users want to send users who want to locate the location of the photo, or just want to document this aspect, it is good to save the position data of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="276">The question is, how do the GPS data come into the picture? first, you should know that exiv2 supports many GPS data fields, such as direction, saddle and map references. there are at least three ways to achieve this. directly with the correct hardware, by post-processing of the GPS data and image files with the KIPI module for geographical mapping (manual) and finally via manual input of known places.</seg>
<seg id="277">As far as we know there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit. but there are a few working with GPS receivers. either as a map module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth.</seg>
<seg id="278">Cameras with GPS interface: CoyoteEye iPAQ Ike Kodak DCS Pro Nikon DSLR rioh Pro G3 Sony</seg>
<seg id="279">Downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with gpsman or gpsbabel. however, you must save these data in gpx format because this is the only format supported by the module for geographical mapping.</seg>
<seg id="280">There are different programs for & Windows; and Mac OS that can extract and correlate the data of images and GPS. on the following page you can do the same under & Linux; gpsCorr or gpsPhoto</seg>
<seg id="281">If you want to know the long- and latitude or other data, then you can use this script using the ExifTool by Phil Harvey. it uses the predefined coordinates created by maps.google for example.</seg>
<seg id="282">Maps.google.com does not show any European street maps. here are some European sites, at least in French, German and Spanish, which show all navigation details for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="283">& digitized; tries to give you so much control over its operations as possible. there are many settings that change the behavior of & digities.To access these settings, you need to select in the menu Setting. select the settings dialog is divided into eight pages. you can switch between these settings by clicking on the icons of the left side.</seg>
<seg id="284">Select action can be set to preview or start screen editing. you place the default behavior of & digitised; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view.</seg>
<seg id="285">This page contains, as shown below, the identity and copyright data. these data are automatically written into the appropriate IPTC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface. also in case of a database synchronization, these data are written in IPTC fields.</seg>
<seg id="286">Author's title is a synonym for the author of the author: this field should include the photographer's job title. these can be designations such as a photographer, freelance photographer or independent, commercial photographer. since this is a detailed description of the field of authority, this must also be filled.</seg>
<seg id="287">Publisher is a synonym for providers: use this field to indicate the name that the photo offers. this does not have to be the author, if this is for a news agency like Reuters or Associated Press, then these organizations should be listed here. if the picture is a bearing photo, then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here.</seg>
<seg id="288">The IPTC actions store the data in the appropriate IPTC fields. by doing so, the metadata is permanently included in the image and not only in the database of & digikam; this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported in & digitized; imported without being lost.</seg>
<seg id="289">Save image captions as embedded labeling (JFIF) in JPEG images: this synchronizes the comments you add to your photos using the labels embedded in the images. attention: with images that already contain labels, these are overwritten by & digitized.</seg>
<seg id="290">The Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the cursor is in the main window over a file. depending on the chosen option, this information is displayed or not.</seg>
<seg id="291">& # 160; digitised; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats. to specify which file types & digikam; to specify which file types & digikam; to indicate, you can add and remove the file extensions of this list. any file in a digiplug; album folder that has none of these extensions is ignored by & digiplug; ignored.</seg>
<seg id="292">The default settings can be reset again by pressing the Update button on the right of each category.</seg>
<seg id="293">The settings of the luminaire from & digiplug; on this page you can set the default values. each time you open the luminaire these settings are switched on. however, some pictures have different sizes and the synchronous mode is then not available. if you have one, you can only get better results.</seg>
<seg id="294">By default, image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos. if you prefer a different color, you can select them here. you can turn off the toolbar if you use the image processing in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="295">Over- and underexposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture. these colors are defined here. in image processing, this view mode can be switched on and off with F10 and F11.</seg>
<seg id="296">With Chroma subsampling it is meant that the images are encoded in a higher resolution of the luminance than in the color information. please read this article in Wikipedia zur nearer explanation.</seg>
<seg id="297">With the PNG compression setting, you can reduce the size of PNG files. this operation does not reduce image quality, because PNG uses a lossless algorithm. if you have a fast calculator, you can set this value to high compression. this means 1: a low and 9 high compression.</seg>
<seg id="298">The TIFF-files option can be used to compress the default compression algorithm for TIFF images. this reduces the size of the TIFF images. it does not affect the image quality since the default algorithm is lossless.</seg>
<seg id="299">With the loss-free JPEG 2000 files, you can save loss-free. even if you select the loss-prone setting, the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than with normal JPEG. when this paragraph is written, metadata has not yet been supported but was in planning.</seg>
<seg id="300">In previous versions of & digiplug; image processing was only a picture viewer for photos. at the moment it is very fast becoming a tool for manipulation of your photos. with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="301">The default value is that all green pixels are the same. if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels at odd lines, this difference generates a grid pattern in the output. this option draws the image a little soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or the AHD quality method.</seg>
<seg id="302">If this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic color balance is used.</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is only supported for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images get more details in four steps. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">The default is the pointed light, i.e. the parts of your images that are burned-in due to the inability of your camera to look at the pointed-up white. use the setting piercing white in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results since it displays the pointed-lights in various pink tones. last but not least you can try to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not satisfy as fast as green and red. and drapw therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions from the not saturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">When you select the Reconstruction option, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can therefore be adapted individually for each image.</seg>
<seg id="308">Set the luminance value according to your taste. you probably have to set it a bit higher than the default 1. however, this can also be done later in the image options of the & digiplug; image processing. in order to keep the time for dehydration small, you should proceed conservatively.</seg>
<seg id="309">A Demosaicing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the particle data that many cameras have and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels. this algorithm is also known as CFA interpolation or color design.</seg>
<seg id="310">& Dcraw provide you three alternatives: bilinear, VNG interpolation and AHD interpolation. after some tests it looks as if AHD interpolation (for Adaptive Homogenated Directed) was the first algorithm used by Dcraw. however, it creates color artefacts at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="311">If you know the color deviation of your lenses you can set the red and blue correction values here. this is certainly the best method for a color grading correction, as it is done during the raw conversion.</seg>
<seg id="312">A profile translates the color information and gives instructions how to return it. there are also LCMS and & digikam; information how to translate the color information from one color space to the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible.</seg>
<seg id="313">Behavior Questions when a picture is opened in image processing / Color management module with raw files start.</seg>
<seg id="314">Color Profile folder Select here the folder, such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .color / ICC where you can save all your profiles.</seg>
<seg id="315">Settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility & quot; standard squot; for your profiles to deposit. everything can be changed when opening the raw file later.</seg>
<seg id="316">The color management view is an alternative to Xcalib or Argyll. here, only your pictures are color-managed, not the entire screen.</seg>
<seg id="317">The input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model that you are using. not all profiles are created in the same way. there are some, such as Canon, which does not contain color tonmapping or gamma correction. currently, dcraw gamma does not correct conversions at 16 bit depth. this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">There are other options like the Soft-Proof profile that you can emulate how your picture would be returned from a device. this is very useful before you print picture because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors are therefore very saturated. you could manually correct this rather than relying on the blind algorithm of your printer.</seg>
<seg id="319">For most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for. unfortunately not with Canon models. therefore, here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together. this answer is, of course, unofficial:</seg>
<seg id="320">The Canon profile extension provides the style for the target: F for an accurate style, L for landscapes, N for Neutral, P for portrait and S for standard style.</seg>
<seg id="321">KIPI is the & kde; Image plugin interface. it is an interface supported by a number of & kde; image viewer and image processing. by deploying this interface, & digikam; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the KIPI interface.</seg>
<seg id="322">If your distribution has the KIPI modules installed, you will see a list of available modules. select the modules you want to use and these are then downloaded from & digiplug; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition, you will also find some in the context menu of the preview.</seg>
<seg id="323">Short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings shortcuts.</seg>
<seg id="324">Further information (in English) about KIPI modules can be obtained via the KIPI project under http: / / www.kipi-plugins.org or in the manuals of the KIPI modules.</seg>
<seg id="325">The settings of the slide show should be easy to understand. the upper knob adjusts the time between the image transitions, usually 4-5 seconds. the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off which are displayed at the bottom of the images during the display.</seg>
<seg id="326">The camera features show on the left a list of all the cameras supported at the time. on the right-hand side there is a button Automatic detection, which attempts to identify a camera connected to the computer. if you want to use this, make sure that the camera is properly connected, switched on and in image display mode.</seg>
<seg id="327">At the bottom you can set the path for USB- and FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) mass storage cameras. this field is only active if you have selected a USB or FireWire mass storage camera from the camera list. you need to specify the path, / mnt / camera or / mnt / user, where you can mount your camera.</seg>
<seg id="328">To use your digital camera with & digiplug; to use, you need to connect the camera to your computer, bring it to the display mode and turn on.</seg>
<seg id="329">Check out if you have digitised; the camera automatically detects. if not, you can set camera models and port manually. after you have set up your camera, your camera will appear in the camera menu.</seg>
<seg id="330">You can select any name for your camera. this is displayed in the main window of the main window. if you have more than one camera, you can insert them here.</seg>
<seg id="331">With the option confirmation dialog for moving images in the Mülleimer you can indicate the conversation of & digikam; when deleting a photo in an album. in the sections delete a photos and delete an album you will find more details.</seg>
<seg id="332">The editorial changes through the right side bar can be silently supported by & digitised; if you use the option to apply changes in the right sidebar without prompting. otherwise, you will need to save the changes using the button changes.</seg>
<seg id="333">You can also display the display of the welcome screen of & digikam; under certain circumstances this speeds up the start process of & digitized;.</seg>
<seg id="334">The setting When starting new photos is forcing & digitized; searching the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos. this extends the start time of & digitized; if something has been deleted from the base folder, & digicame; you know if it is to delete them from the database.</seg>
<seg id="335">Different color schemes can be used in & digitised; used to customize the main window to your taste. these settings can be selected from Settings Design from the toolbar. a preview of the available designs is listed below:</seg>
<seg id="336">These designs have been defined in simple text files. if you are interested in creating a new design for & digiplug; to create, you will find more information on this in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="337">& digitized; contains a fast image processing with some basic tools. you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve. image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview and selection of the item Display / Edit.</seg>
<seg id="338">The image processing includes a number of tools to improve your images. some of them are available as modules in & digitized; so you may not be part of your distribution. you can find more information about the KIPI modules in the Image Processing section.</seg>
<seg id="339">A status line at the bottom of the window, the filename, current file number, magnification factor and the current image size indicate.</seg>
<seg id="340">A menu bar at the top and below the toolbar for quick access to the most frequently required functions.</seg>
<seg id="341">The editing functions of the image processing will change your photos. however, none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or Save button Save from the toolbar. note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image.</seg>
<seg id="342">So you might want to make a copy of your image before you change it. this can be done with File Save as.</seg>
<seg id="343">As long as you have not saved the photo, you can restore the original image by restoring from the File menu or using the button The Recover of Recover the Image Processing in the toolbar. you then lose any change you have done on the photo since the last saving.</seg>
<seg id="344">Virtually any action of image processing can be reversed or restored. the last action can be reversed by selecting Edit Return and Restore by selecting Edit Restore from the menu.</seg>
<seg id="345">If you use this frequently, you should make the keyboard shortcut, Ctrl; -Z to undo and Ctrl; -Shift-Z to restore.</seg>
<seg id="346">If you press the & LMB; press the back or restore button at the toolbar for a moment, you will receive a context menu. if you select one of the menu items, all actions in between will also be reversed or restored.</seg>
<seg id="347">Once you have started editing, you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword, using the navigation buttons in the toolbar, image high, image down or the entries in the File menu. if you have made changes to the current photo, you will be asked if you want to save it.</seg>
<seg id="348">You can zoom in and zoom into the photo in which you use Ctrl; mouse wheel or the symbols in the toolbar or the entries in the View menu.</seg>
<seg id="349">To customize a photo to the window size, you can use this button in the toolbar: automatically select magnification factor</seg>
<seg id="350">View Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode. you come to the normal view in which you are using the Esc key. usually, you can change this in the Settings dialog by & digiplug; you can view it from the digiplug; main window. see the section to set up image editing.</seg>
<seg id="351">If you want to print the current image, you can print in the File menu and get the default & kde; print dialog. you can customize the settings here before you print your photo.</seg>
<seg id="352">From the main menu you can print individual images or whole sets. all image preview pages can be printed from your selection. you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select Export Wizard from the Export menu. if you follow the wizard, you just need to make your choice.</seg>
<seg id="353">The & digiplug; main window has a sidebar at the right, providing important information and actions for the selected images. the same sidebar is available without the navigation arrow, also in image editing. it is displayed when one of the five riders is clicked:</seg>
<seg id="354">Multiple Click on the same tab lets the sidebar appear or disappear into the margin.</seg>
<seg id="355">In the label view you can enter or insert captions with unlimited size. note the note below. the text is UTF-8 compatible. this means that all special characters are allowed. the captions are copied to EXIF- and IPTC fields so you can be used by other programs.</seg>
<seg id="356">The IPTC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2,000 characters. all comments will be truncated after 2000 characters and special characters are reformed. if you want to use the IPTC labelling field in other applications, you should consider these restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="357">After you have commented, use either the button user or simply switch to the next image, the captions will then be saved.</seg>
<seg id="358">Next to the user button, there is a button More. with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database. however, you can also write the metadata into the files. however, this will always be done if you have chosen a metadata setting that is always written into the images.</seg>
<seg id="359">The review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in searches and sortations. it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the sidebar or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + 0... 5. to evaluate multiple images at the same time, select it and use the contextual menu.</seg>
<seg id="360">The evaluation is written in the IPTC field of Urgency. the coding follows the scheme in the following table:</seg>
<seg id="361">The keyword display shows a search box to filter the keywords, the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this & digipresets session.</seg>
<seg id="362">The keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the given keyword. you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword. this ability is especially useful when you have many keywords.</seg>
<seg id="363">The input field at the bottom is a further simplification when entering keywords in a picture series. if you have entered different keywords, they are saved for quick access.</seg>
<seg id="364">Keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree. all keywords of an image are stored in the IPTC field keyword.</seg>
<seg id="365">If multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree, this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection, if you want to provide a selection with a keyword, please read the section keyword filter.</seg>
<seg id="366">The Keyline keyword filter is used to change the selection of the pictures displayed in the main window. normally, the left sidebar is used with their album, - date, keyword and searches. if in addition one or more keyword filters are used from the right side, only the intersection of these two is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="367">You can also drag and drop tags. suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords. if the keyword already exists, you can simply drag it from the right sidebar and put it on the selection. then a dialog appears asking you if you want to put the keyword.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the upper example, the main window displays the pictures on a calendar tag. the keyword filter is based on no words, which reduces the amount to three images. they were selected using Ctrl + a, and then a keyword was drawn from the right key tree to the selection and stored there. a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set.</seg>
<seg id="369">This search for changes takes place at each start of the program. it can also be switched off under Settings Different.</seg>
<seg id="370">If you have a rule with and have created and realize that it should be one or its, you can easily change it with a double click on the text and in the control area.</seg>
<seg id="371">(1): the entry that is searched in the database. this can be an album, name, keyword, image, keyword, etc.</seg>
<seg id="372">(3): the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database.</seg>
<seg id="373">You can, for example, set an Advanced search across all elements of the database using the following options:</seg>
<seg id="374">If you want to group options, you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button grouping. the options then look like this:</seg>
<seg id="375">Why were Picasaweb and Flickr not listed? free space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to save the images in full resolution.</seg>
<seg id="376">This article / tutorial was written mainly by Elle Stone. special thanks to Elle for this work. I have mainly adjusted it to & digikam; s concrete implementation adapted.</seg>
<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable variance from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor resemble those of your camera or scanner and that will publish the colors that you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">If the theme comes to color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with links with deeper information to make your own informed decisions so that you get the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="379">If your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below, you don't have to worry about color management.</seg>
<seg id="380">You work on a monitor that is calibrated on the sRGB color space. (see below for more information)</seg>
<seg id="381">Their only other image outputs are via email or web, where sRGB is the de facto standard.</seg>
<seg id="382">So if sRGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone, why should one then use a different colour space and have to think about color drops?</seg>
<seg id="383">A visual example of the limitation of sRGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below. it shows a 2-dimensional representation of all colors that we can see, the horseshoe-shaped region, and the colors in the sRGB color space, the triangular region.</seg>
<seg id="384">If you want to compare the 2-dimensional representation of sRGB with some larger color spaces, visit Bruce Lindbloom's excellent site and then click Info and then on Information About RGB Working Spaces.</seg>
<seg id="385">Do I need to sound my monitor when I chose to work only in the sRGB color space?</seg>
<seg id="386">Yes! whether you are working in the sRGB colour space or not, you have to calibrate your monitor, since sRGB assumes that your; onitor works on sRGB. if you are working as a colour space of sRGB then you must either sound your monitor on sRGB standard, use a suitable monitor profile or both.</seg>

<seg id="388">This tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before you attempt to continue manual editing.</seg>
<seg id="389">The functions Normalize, Compare, Automatic Balance and Contrast extend from the Correct automatic correction automatically try to make the most of your colors. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo.</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the denial values across the entire image, leaving the darkest point black and the brightest point as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or well-washed.</seg>
<seg id="391">Balance: this method adjusts the intensity of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. it sometimes achieves very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracles in a picture or destroys it.</seg>
<seg id="392">Automatic adjustment: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channels. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the entire histogram range.</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the widest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible with well-balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">The white balance correction is slightly restricted because of a colour space with 8 bits per color. if you are too far from the original image, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in the raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your possibilities for correction will be better.</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">The preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left you can see both the original image and the preview of the target image. the preview will be dynamically adapted to the tool's preferences. if you want to see the original image again, click on the subwindow.</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">Right above is a histogram showing dynamically changed once you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values. with a button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="400">The contrast of your result depends on shade, saturation and gamma. the shade adjustment lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or even dim down.</seg>
<seg id="401">To play anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. in this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="402">In addition, you can set the white balance with the list of preferences. the following settings are available:</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed. you will get the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. each setting of the white balance you set allows you to save it to a text file and load it later.</seg>
<seg id="405">The Preferences button resets all filter values back to their default values and neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in another photo as your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed.</seg>
<seg id="406">You can set the encoding depth per color channel of the edited image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for formats PNG, PNM, TIFF, and DNG.</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of raw images. it uses the modification and assignment of color profiles. color tonmapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness. a detailed manual for using color profiles lets you consult the chapter colour management.</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under color correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for several photos. this is helpful when your camera or scanner always make the same mistake and therefore always need the same correction.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">The & digiplug; tool colour effects will provide you with four color effects, a solar panel effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canister filter.</seg>
<seg id="411">In times of chemical processing, Solarisation, also known as sabatier, was an effect that was created when a partially developed pressure replaced a short flash and afterwards the development of the image complained. this had the effect that the brighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. this tool allows you to fine-adjust this interesting effect.</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase eventually creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar panel effect. the original image is the (1) and that processes the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it beautifies many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverse colour film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias strongly saturated colours are too much for some photographs, especially those of barely landscapes.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light to the contrast edges. the level parameter controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the thickness of the neon light. in large pictures the filter can relieve the whole CPU for a moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can also experiment the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be viewed in preview. once you are satisfied with the result, use the Ok button and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo in poor lighting conditions, you can get the reverse problem: a too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">Between the complex tools Gradation and the simple Leuchthickness / Contrast / Gamma, the tool is set to improve the exposure time. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the scope of the slide. concrete the three sliders below the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="420">The window contains a graph of the intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas.</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to shift the controller and make sure the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">On the right, the original and the preview of the image can be viewed. the preview will be updated dynamically, using the settings of the image. on the left hand side, the following options are available.</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box shows whether the histogram is represented with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera, the linear histogram is most useful. in this case, the linear histogram is dominated by a single column. in this case, the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">Three knobs: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called Gammavalues.</seg>
<seg id="425">The three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of the shadows, medium and bright tones. in addition, there is a button for fully automatic adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="426">Output values: the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area. there are also two knobs that can be used to change the output values as interactive as in the input values. for example, compression of output values can be used to create a light image as background while something else is seen in the foreground.</seg>
<seg id="427">Automatic: with this button, the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image.</seg>
<seg id="428">Save as and load: with these buttons, the set values can be saved in the file system and loaded later. to do so, the Gimp level format is used.</seg>
<seg id="429">If you use this mode and the three color pipettes, the input values are automatically readjusted for all shadows, medium and sun shades. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input values of the red, green, blue and luminance channels.</seg>
<seg id="430">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="431">Below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input values to the red, green and blue channel of a photos. intensity and alpha channel, as well as the output values are unchanged. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected image with (2).</seg>
<seg id="432">On the left, half of the original and the target image will be displayed. the preview will be updated dynamically depending on your settings. on the right, the following options are available:</seg>
<seg id="433">Modified channel: this box allows to specify the channel that is modified by the module:</seg>
<seg id="434">In addition to this box, there are two symbols to switch between a linear and logarithmic view. for pictures taken with a digital camera, the linear mode is the most sensible. in this case, the linear mode generates a wide beam. in this case, logarithmic mode will help.</seg>
<seg id="435">For example, if you move a curve arrow to the right, e.g. the bright tones, then you can see that these bright tones correspond with darker output tones and that the corresponding image pixels become darker.</seg>
<seg id="436">Preview the original photos is a red marker to see. if you want to move this marker to the area you want to change, a fitting line will appear on the curve representing the original value. create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste.</seg>
<seg id="437">Save as and load: with these buttons, you can do exactly this. each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later. the file format for this is the Gimp curve format.</seg>
<seg id="438">If you use this method and the three color pipette buttons automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of shade, middle and sun shades. activate the color pipette that you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red, green, blue and luminance curve.</seg>
<seg id="439">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to display overexposed pixels. if in more than one channel overexposed pixels are displayed, you get the combined result. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect on the final result.</seg>
<seg id="440">Below you can see a black and white photo, which was corrected in the luminance channel. shadow and sun shades were set with the color pipette and applied to the curves. the original image is (1) and corrected (2).</seg>
<seg id="441">The channel mixer of the & digiplug; image processing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photos.</seg>
<seg id="442">The channel mixer is another highly developed tool to mix the color tones of the images. you can edit it from the menu colors channel mixer of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="443">The channel selection box allows you to select the color for the histogram: this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and precipitation. the left pane of the window shows you a preview. the original can be viewed by comparison with your own rider.</seg>
<seg id="444">The preview of the target image has a red marker. if you position it in the picture, a vertical line appears in the histogram to show you the corresponding color value.</seg>
<seg id="445">The controls for the module are right down: controls for red, green and construction allow you to mix these channels. if you activate luminance, the image will retain the overall brightness as well, as the channel mixer then is the tool to generate great black and white conversions of your photos. try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits.</seg>
<seg id="446">Sometimes, especially when you mix monochrome, the reduction of a color becomes a visible noise coming from the colour space. color is made up of small noise files that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different. if that is the case, you can improve your monochrome conversion in which you first reduce the color space.</seg>
<seg id="447">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any mixer setting you can save for later and then load. the file format used is the Gimp channel mixer format.</seg>
<seg id="448">The Overexposure indicator option controls all color channels to view overexposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels. this is an indicator, i.e. you get the effect only in the preview and it is no effect to see the final result.</seg>
<seg id="449">Below you can see a photo in which the blue channel has been readjusted. the Luminance option is activated. the original image is below (1) and the illustrated image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="450">Black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your ability to abstraction. with the development of digital photography, black / white is a work step, as color images can be converted easily on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="451">Ilford Delta 100, Ilford Delta 400, Ilford Delta 400 Pro 3200, Ilford FP4 Plus, Ilford HP5 Plus, Ilford PanF Plus, Ilford XP2 Super</seg>
<seg id="452">Green filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter. this looks good, with all scenarios and fits perfectly to portraits of the sky. similar to the 004 Cokin (tm) green filter.</seg>
<seg id="453">Orange Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter. this improves landscapes, maritime scenes and aerial photos. similar to the 002 Cokin (tm) orange filter.</seg>
<seg id="454">Red filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter. this creates dramatic celestial effects and can simulate moonlight scenes at the time of the day, similar to the 003 Cokin (tm) rotor filter.</seg>
<seg id="455">Yellow Filter: simulates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter. this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast. it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 Cokin (tm) yellow filter.</seg>
<seg id="456">Sepiaton: produces warm light and middle tones as it adds a bit of cold in the shading tones. this is very similar to the process of stopping a pressure and redevelopment in a sapatonic. this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 Cokin (tm) Sepiafilter.</seg>
<seg id="457">With the & digiplug; applying tool texture you can apply decorative textures to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="458">By adding a texture to your image, regardless of whether it is a color image or not, you can look like an oil painting on a canvas, the stitch of an old master, a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall.</seg>
<seg id="459">Relief: move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three-dimensionality of the texture on the image.</seg>
<seg id="460">A paper text effect has been applied in the photo below. the original image is (1) and the altered under (2) to see. the relief model has been set to 200.</seg>
<seg id="461">With the & digiplug; tool frame add a decorative frame to be added to a picture.</seg>
<seg id="462">Keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task. one possibility to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame. this is a psychological barrier for the scattering eye. under picture frame, the module can be started from image processing.</seg>
<seg id="463">Type: with this parameter, set the desired frame type for your picture. in depth the image is surrounded by a colored line, Niepce surrounded it with a thin line and a wide frame (ideal for black and white images), bevelled it with a nice three-dimensional frame that is ideal for a button effect and decorative added a decorative frame with patterns.</seg>
<seg id="464">Width: specifies the width of the frame in percent. the range of values for width is from 1% to 50%.</seg>
<seg id="465">The target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original, but the same aspect ratio. this is important for printing the images, especially if you have previously used the tool after aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="466">With this handy tool, you can easily insert a formatted text into a picture in any place. this also works in several places if you need it.</seg>
<seg id="467">This tool is very intuitive to use. simply type the text and place it with the mouse. use text output, orientation, color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you require. you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi-transparent background.</seg>
<seg id="468">Each setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press the button OK. once the image has been saved, the text is part of the image. it can no longer be changed.</seg>
<seg id="469">With the & digiplug; tool template can apply a template over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="470">The Image Template menu can be used in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture.</seg>
<seg id="471">For the template there are no restrictions regarding the size and orientation. however, you need to use the PNG file format and should work with maximum compression (9) to reduce the file size of the template. if you want to add your template to & digiplug; send an email in English to the digiplug; mailinglist digiplug-users @ kde.org..</seg>
<seg id="472">If you use this tool for the first time, you need to set your stencil folder with the button base folder in the dialog. select the folder where you copied the templates files. these settings will be noted for the next start.</seg>
<seg id="473">After setting the root folder for templates it appears a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the stencil. the selection of a folder updates the template bar of the templates automatically.</seg>
<seg id="474">Under the preview are three buttons with which you can change the magnification factor and position of your image.</seg>
<seg id="475">Enlarge: this button enlarges the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="476">Shrink: this button resets the image below. it is centered around the position of the mouse. if you want to apply the template to the whole picture, you must resize the image accordingly. check it with the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="477">Move: use this button to move the image below the template. to do so, take the picture and place it at the desired position.</seg>
<seg id="478">Use OK if you want to apply the template to your picture. the image will then be adjusted automatically to the preview size.</seg>
<seg id="479">& digitized; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">Sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but it produces, especially in dark areas, grainy images.</seg>
<seg id="481">Blur mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually it sharpens no bit, it works rather psychovisually. you can use it to remove atmospheric mist and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus and most digitized images require a correction of sharpness. this is because the digitalization process has to summarize colors with only minimal differences to a color point. this again leads to sharp edges a bit blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras normally need more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">For JPEG images a camera is often used for internal sharpening. in contrast, images in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing.</seg>
<seg id="485">Some scanners use a sharpness filter during reading the image. if you turn off this, you will get control of your image.</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. you can use the menu entry Correct sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">You should be careful with this as the results do not naturally work: the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also enhances the noise. generally, the most useful technique for sharpening a picture is refocussing. you can refocus more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to soften the softness with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp maskieren is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview help to edit the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">There are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or the amount increase the effect. if you make the blur mask strong, noise and the impression of grenades are created close to sharp edges.</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow bigger radii. therefore, you should sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">The threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. this allows for a minimum difference to define for an edge of the filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharper and therefore, beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided.</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the unsharp masked filter. the original image is the (1) and the edited image the (2). unsharp masked with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold = 0.0.</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiplug; tool refocus a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted defaltation filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to get an image to & quot; refocusing. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Viennese filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening pictures is using a blur mask. refocus reaches usually better results than blurred. you can start it from the menu by refocusing colors in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">In practice, the fissure fission is much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauß's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixies that are far from the original source pixel. in most cases, the FIR Wiener Inverse of the Gauß's folding is influenced by the distant pixels even very strongly.</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should yield 1 good results. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred, but pay attention to halo notes.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module.</seg>
<seg id="501">Noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very bad. a usable value is 0.03. a high value will even further pollute the image.</seg>
<seg id="502">Gauß's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurring is authentic. in most cases, you should set this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a nonzero value, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter.</seg>
<seg id="503">Matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the size of the matrix can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or Gauß's sharpness. however, please note that the module is very slow when you select large values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10.</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameter you set will be stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">Try to do all cutting, color and intensity corrections on the picture before using the module.</seg>
<seg id="506">Otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations that are not visible immediately, but leave behind unpleasant artifacts.</seg>
<seg id="507">If you read and compress images, & eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image.</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally, unsharp masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by using the blurred masking a greater neighborhood than sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">Theoretically, unsharp masking must always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of blur. for the Viennese filter it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practically the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the blur mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better in processing small details.</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred color image has to be corrected. this image has been taken with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the methods for the correction of sharpness in digital images, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The slider controls the blurring of the area that has been darkened in order to generate a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">The ink tints allow a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can set this here.</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various preferences as starting points to simplify the restoration. the options available are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to fine adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to uniform smoothness over the image. whereas larger values are mainly smoothed by homogeneous regions and details. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value draws near to 1 only in one direction. if you have a movie grained or CCD rustling will produce a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">Smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor beyond allit. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image.</seg>
<seg id="522">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is passed through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">Angle step width is [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is chosen small, small angles should also be selected. therefore, make sure that small angles make a long term. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs.</seg>
<seg id="525">Integral stepping width [0,1, 10]: integrated step width in pixels. you should set the value of less 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2.</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more on quality that you get by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to omit it.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save As and Load buttons do exactly this. any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">Correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and get a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="529">Below you can see how to remove image errors with small artefacts. the module is used on a photo that has been made in Guatemala City with an analog camera. as you can see, there is a strange black artefact in the foreground that caused by poor film storage during the trip. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digiplug; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">This tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts that come from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from camera or Moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines.</seg>
<seg id="532">If you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial.</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot at the top shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grained noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">In the following you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the subwindow Advanced Settings can remain with default settings.</seg>
<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel are needed and can control the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor flaws cleared.</seg>
<seg id="536">Sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel distance that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is increased, the adaptive filter will no longer be able to obtain image details and noise or lubricating occurs again.</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the filter's response. if it is too strong it cannot be removed the entire noise or noise peaks can occur. set it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifact without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process which is controlled by the details pane.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gamma: controls the gamma-tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically more strongly roughened. however, it also contaminates the shadow areas.</seg>
<seg id="541">Attenuation: controls the adjustment of the phase shock absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother when it is too high. if it is on its minimum, noise and phase jitter may appear at the edges.</seg>
<seg id="542">Save under and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected one (2). the noise reduction has been applied with the default settings.</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the image a little soft is fortunately much easier than to sharpen a picture. use the tool to soften the softness with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digiplug; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">This filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your pictures. it is very well adapted to remove gauss's noise, movie grabbing, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or later digitalized pictures.</seg>
<seg id="547">The same algorithm can be used for color and texture mapping. the texture mapping is performed using a different tool, image error correction. the restoration algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / Frannkreich and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect, in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm, it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that are to be seen in the uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">The Save as and Load buttons do exactly this. any hiring of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="550">Photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and get a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button.</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise reduction. the module is applied to a black and white photo that has been recorded with a Minolta (tm) 700Si camera on an Ilford (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time, textures were reduced to an old color photograph that was read with a scanner. you can see the scan artefacts caused by the scanner lighting and photo paper. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="553">The & digiplug; tool Hotpixel allows you to remove hotpixels from photos using a CCD camera like 8. it uses algorithms from the JPEGPixi project, which are copyrighted by Martin Dickopp.</seg>
<seg id="554">Bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high-quality raw mode photographs because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels.</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot Pixelquot; and "quot; light Pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image subtraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the dark image. the tool will detect automatic the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">If you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark image directly in order to detect new hot or light pixels through CCD defects.</seg>
<seg id="558">First, as described in the previous section, you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the wizard remembers the last dark image and loads it automatically in the next session.</seg>
<seg id="559">The image area and the preview help you to correct the result within the image. the preview window displays the output of the filter with the current settings. bad pixels are raised in all preview sections.</seg>
<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the filters available:</seg>
<seg id="561">Cut: an average of the neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line.</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear surface (2 dim) or a group of linear curves (1 dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-square surface (2 dim) or a group of square corners (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2 dim) or a group of cubic curves (1 dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">Below you can see the hotpixel correction on a color photograph taken from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure. the original image was enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected image is below (2).</seg>
<seg id="566">The & digitized; vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image.</seg>
<seg id="567">Wide angle lenses, in particular those in medium and large photo format, can often not evenly illuminate the entire sensor range. instead & quot; vignettierenquot; (shading) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="568">But it also has disadvantages. many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to hold the camera by hand. wide angle lenses should also be used with center filter, an aperture of f / 16 or less, since there are otherwise blurring effects caused by movement.</seg>
<seg id="569">With the large exposures of today's filters and the color or grey stage depth of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image made without this filter. the tool vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker.</seg>
<seg id="570">With three regulators you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image.</seg>
<seg id="571">Density: this parameter controls the degree of brightness damping at the point of the greatest density the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which corresponds to an optical filter with aperture setting of 1, or randomly a luminous intensity of 2. increase the density to compensate for a greater degree of vignetting.</seg>
<seg id="572">Denial, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you need to re-adjust the exposure of the target image with these options. the controls only provide you with positive values, as you only need to increase the settings.</seg>
<seg id="573">If you want a finer readjustment of the target image, set the values for luminous intensity / contrast / gamma at zero and use the gradation from the menu. image processing from the menu Color Gradation.</seg>
<seg id="574">This is an example of the vignetting correction on a picture. the original image (1) shows the vignetting in the corners and (2) the corrected image.</seg>
<seg id="575">The & digiplug; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Hodson.</seg>
<seg id="576">This tool works with geometric distortions. color distortion can not be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second crest deals with the general geometrical distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex form of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">The coefficient of the third degree has a similar circular effect, flat however at the edges. this correction is not applied in the mold.</seg>
<seg id="579">The coefficient 4th degree corrects the remote corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be virtually eliminated.</seg>
<seg id="580">General: this value controls the thickness of distortion second degree. negative values can be corrected using tone-shaped distortions and positive values of cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">Corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth. this value is stronger at the margins than in the middle of the image. for most lenses, the 'Corner parameter' has the inverted character of the parameter.</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resizes the image size and thus creates a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image diminishes.</seg>
<seg id="583">Brighten: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">To help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start.</seg>
<seg id="585">The tone or cushion-shaped correction should be performed before all trimming or size changes. the best result is this correction than the first one. if you re-cut a picture and then perform a ton-shaped correction, the effect is apparently the wrong.</seg>
<seg id="586">To help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and horizontal guide line. move the mouse cursor in the picture preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the edge of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point.</seg>
<seg id="587">If you correct a cushion distortion, the resulting image will have black corners. you can remove these from the editing tool from the editing or zoom slider of this dialog using the cutting tool in the Edit menu.</seg>
<seg id="588">The next logical step for some motifs such as images from the front, frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees. note that if you hold the camera by hand, you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective.</seg>
<seg id="589">This is an example of the ton-shaped correction applied to a church in Norway. the original image is below (1) and the corrected image below (2).</seg>
<seg id="590">The algorithm is based on a method for simulating infrared film of the GimpGuru.org web page which is accessible under this URL. the filter reproduces the well-known Ilford (tm) SFX200 Iinfrarotfilm, see this URL. this film has a sensitivity range of 200-800 ISO.</seg>
<seg id="591">In the left side of the window you can select the area for preview. if you move the red rectangle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the image.</seg>
<seg id="592">Below the preview you can set two parameters for film graying and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the Add Movie grained option if you want to simulate the grained texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO knob changes the amount of film size and dominance of the color green (chlorophyll in nature). green meadows are white like snow!</seg>
<seg id="593">Since the filter mixes color channels for the reproduction of infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing.</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand. the original image is below (1) and the edited image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values create a kind of aura in the top-light.</seg>
<seg id="595">The & digiplug; Filter Panel is an easy-to-use tool to reproduce film grain on your pictures. this is known from classic high speed movies such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, manufacturers mix large silver grains of photo emulsion.</seg>
<seg id="596">The film-grain effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street-photographic, grainy view specially in your monochrome photos, you have to use this filter.</seg>
<seg id="597">The controller can calibrate the ISO sensitivity to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, adjusted to ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times.</seg>
<seg id="598">This is an example of the film-grain effect applied to a black / white image. the original image is the (1) and that worked the (2). the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO-1600.</seg>
<seg id="599">The & digiplug; Filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting. it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="600">The & digiplug; Filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting. nature pictures and still life are good for this effect.</seg>
<seg id="601">There are two knobs to influence this effect. the upper selects the brush size between one and five. thicker brushes are better suited for large images. smoothing controls the smoothness or, viewed from the other side, the hinge.</seg>
<seg id="602">This is an example of the oil painting effect. the original image is marked with (1) and the editing is marked with (2). brush size for this 640 pixel large picture is 1 and smooth 17.</seg>
<seg id="603">The & digiplug; filter carbon capture uses color and intensity gradients to create a cabbage ze. the lines that define the outlines in drawing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you chose to outline yourself. this would be good pictures to start with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two knobs with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower adjusts the contrast (smooths).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the coal drawing filter. the original image (1) and the modified image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>
<seg id="606">The & digiplug; Filter engraving shapes your image in 3-D as if it was stamped in wax. it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="607">The filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3-D effect. it works particularly well with images with a simple structure where color is not the most important of the content. the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a grey, monstrous landscape.</seg>
<seg id="608">The depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering. a value of 30, corresponds to 10%, is the default setting.</seg>
<seg id="609">This is an example of the engraving filter. the original (1) and the edited image (2). the used depth is 10%.</seg>
<seg id="610">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distorting effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="611">Shaft Blocks 1: divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is viewed by glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="612">Wave Block 2: analogous to the wave blocks 1, the image is distorted along with a different version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects at any time using the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom on blurring: blurts the image along star shaped lines that originate from a center point. this simulates blurring a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurts the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurts the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to be back to the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">Motion blurring: blurts the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train photographing, camera.</seg>
<seg id="619">Softness: blurring the image softly into the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow.</seg>
<seg id="620">Shaking blurring: blurts the image through random shifting of the pixels and thus simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the color basins in the picture and wipes them without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">Mosaic: divide the photo into rectangular cells and then create it, by filling with an average pixel value, new.</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time using the button Select.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses a algorithm protected by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image, it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images. number changes the number and density of the drops. fish eyes change the optical effect of the drop in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">You can drag & drop; image editing needs to keep an area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops.</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops filter. the original picture (1) shows a calm sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">If the photo has the wrong orientation, you can place it in the right direction by mirroring or turning. the tools can be used in the menu Transformers Rotation or Transformers mirroring.</seg>
<seg id="629">Photo inflating is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo at a minimum loss of picture quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is, how can you inflate a picture and hold the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the boundaries of the resolution are reached? how can you restore or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose the size change in the menu and enter the target values. the dialog is to be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">Change the tool to size using a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small image with better quality then try the tool to inflate.</seg>
<seg id="633">Many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo inflated was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="634">You must tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the new size tab and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">Maintain aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size.</seg>
<seg id="636">Regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value, the more is smoothed. this is necessary if there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turmoil effect it has to be set higher than 3.</seg>
<seg id="637">The Save As and Load buttons are used for this purpose. it can be saved as a text file and loaded later.</seg>
<seg id="638">Photo inflating is very fast with what it does, but it can last very long and pull a high CPU load after you. you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of photo inflating by enlarging a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of the linear standard enlargement.</seg>
<seg id="640">Editing a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery but also a frequently underestimated tool to compile a picture. to trim a photo you simply need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again, the area of the photo will be cut off. this gives you a good overview of how your photo would look after cutting. you can change the size of the area to be cut by pulling at the corners of the rectangle.</seg>
<seg id="642">Once you are satisfied with the cutting, use the button The Ctrl button of the image processing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl; + X). use the entries file Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly-trimmed photo.</seg>
<seg id="643">In the preview pane, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio you defined in the dialog remains intact.</seg>
<seg id="644">Depending on the aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as a portrait or landscape format. in the portrait format, the greater value of the height and the cross-format of the width is always assigned.</seg>
<seg id="645">The tool according to aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. for example, you can see below a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio.</seg>
<seg id="646">At the right end of the dialog there are two buttons to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically.</seg>
<seg id="647">At the bottom of the dialog you can use the Max. relationship button to set the area for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation.</seg>
<seg id="648">When you use the trimming tool the next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in EXIF tables, so that EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image.</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the integration help make it possible to hide help so that you can put together your pictures better. these aids are:</seg>
<seg id="650">Harmonious triangle: harmonic divisions are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-thirds, harmonious triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle with similar harmonic triangles on the diagonal.</seg>
<seg id="651">Golden center: the golden center is a division that is based on various natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="652">The golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it has been used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden division at all times when you put together your pictures, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty.</seg>
<seg id="653">The number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc., where each number after 1 is equal to the sum of their two previous figures. the descending part is 1: 1.618 the golden center.</seg>
<seg id="654">The gold center provides more liquid auxiliary lines when you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">The Golden Spiral will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow on this kind.</seg>
<seg id="656">Another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. this rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should give something that the eye is in the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects.</seg>
<seg id="657">The Golden Triangles also derive from the golden spiral discussed above. their vertices are the central points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are no equal triangles. diagonals on these lines can be released a static object more dynamic.</seg>
<seg id="658">When you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve differently.</seg>
<seg id="659">The options Horizontal mirror and vertical mirror can be used to reflect the harmonic partitions.</seg>
<seg id="660">With the button Color you can set the color of the aid lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the aid lines can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of lines to your current image.</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">If you make a photo then it is easy to keep the camera not exactly vertical or horizontal. this creates a picture in which things are rotated around an angle. you can do this with the digiplug; image processing and the tool free rotation.</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slide angle. the values on this slide are given in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slide again to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">For your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the cursor in the picture preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section.</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transformieren ZuCut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is automatic cutting. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">The Anti-Aliasing option leaves the image a little bit after the turn. however, note the above warning.</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed by a fixed point to the so-called point of reference. this point is in the middle of the image and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you to change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">New width: displays the width of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="671">New height: displays the height of the new image, including empty areas created by the transformation in pixels.</seg>
<seg id="672">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle to the upper right: shows the current angle in degrees at the top right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left: shows the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">After adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a bit dirty. for a single adjustment this effect is small but two adjustments create a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible.</seg>
<seg id="677">After you've adapted the perspective you get unhappy triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with Transformers cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="678">The drawing tool is used to move a part of the image in one direction and move the other part in the opposite direction. for example, horizontal shear will shift the upper part of the image to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the image is distorted into a parallelogram.</seg>
<seg id="679">Shearing your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. if you press presets, the angle is set to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="680">To your help, a vertical and a horizontal line are displayed. move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your picture and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the moving tool to adjust your image.</seg>
<seg id="681">After you have done the shearing, the picture gets a bit blurred. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two insulations generate twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this.</seg>
<seg id="682">After the shearing, the picture has unsightly triangular holes in the corners. one way to remove it is to cut the picture with Transformers cropping out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="683">& digitized; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the formats available depend on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digiplug;</seg>

<seg id="709">(3): the frame to select the preview. you can drag this frame with the mouse within the image and place it on the part of the image you want to preview. the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately.</seg>
<seg id="710">(5): in the lower left corner: here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values. all settings from the last use of the module are noted.</seg>
<seg id="711">The Properties tab displays the essential information about the selected image and is largely self-explanatory. it is grouped in the following sections:</seg>
<seg id="712">Photo properties: shows a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photos. these data are from EXIF data when they are available.</seg>
<seg id="713">This tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Marble mini program. you can press the mouse wheel in or out or hold it down and move it. move it while you click the left mouse button. all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed.</seg>
<seg id="714">& kcoloredit; is an editor for palettes files. the application can be used to edit color palettes and for selecting and naming colors.</seg>

<seg id="725">Graphs are used for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs. the programs are free layout programs. graphs are used in science, especially in computer science. so far, there was no modern & GUI; program to visualize graphs. the programs, which & graphviz; contains, are according to the program author obsolete & X11; - or & tcltk; programs with only a few functions.</seg>
<seg id="726">The & kgraphiviewer; project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs with a modern and user-friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated & kde; program.</seg>
<seg id="727">& kgraphiviewer; is a KDE program for viewing & graphviz; -dot; graphs; programs are free layout programs. & kgraphiviewer; shows graphs with all the possibilities of a well integrated & kde; program in a modern and user-friendly & GUI; on. it has the following functions:</seg>
<seg id="728">Integration in & kate; and & konqueror; (so that a change of the graph in & krate; recomputed the graph and in & kgraphiviewer;)</seg>
<seg id="729">Menu to open the graph in & kate; open or open the graph in & kgraphiviewer; in a & kate; component to open</seg>
<seg id="730">Load large graphs (currently there are problems starting from around 1000 knot and a hack to show more than these nodes)</seg>
<seg id="731">Further required software: & kgraphiviewer; is a & kde; program that presupposes the & graphviz; tool & dot; for the representation of graphs. required in detail:</seg>
<seg id="732">The main window displays the opened graphs, each in a separate subwindow. initially, if you start & kgraphiviewer; without starting an argument, the main window is empty as in the lower screen shot. in this case, the toolbar contains only the icon file and the (empty) list of last opened files. click on the first icon to open the dialog.</seg>
<seg id="733">After selecting one or more / dot; files, the main window looks like in the lower screen shot:</seg>
<seg id="734">As you can see, an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the drawing area. you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically.</seg>
<seg id="735">Use the mouse wheel (high and down without special keys, left and right with pressed & Alt; button);</seg>
<seg id="736">Zooming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10. below you see the maximum comminution of a graph.</seg>
<seg id="737">If the currently in & kgraphiviewer; loaded file has been modified by another program, the following window will be displayed:</seg>
<seg id="738">You can choose whether the graph is to be recharged or if you want to ignore the change. if you want to change your decision later, you can use the menu item Settings kgraphiviewer; set up... use, see also.</seg>
<seg id="739">If you open a graph file outside a current & kgraphiviewer; instance, in the file browser or on the command line, you have the choice whether you want to open a new & kgraphiviewer; instance, or if you want to display the graph in a sub-window of the current instance.</seg>
<seg id="740">As with the last option, you can save your choice permanently, but also change it with the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="741">At program start you can let all graphs of your last session open again. again, you can save your choice both as well as later.</seg>
<seg id="742">You can also specify how the graph should be split to multiple pages. the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely selected.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you use several pages, you can choose whether the portions of the graph, which come to a page, should be fitted to this page. if you keep the aspect ratio, the pages may not be filled out by the parts of the graph.</seg>
<seg id="744">Page preview with a graph distributed over several pages without header and with a different font</seg>
<seg id="745">The Erneut Shop page gives the ability to specify the behavior when a file has been changed to the hard drive, & eg; from another program. you can set a default behavior (automatically recharge or ignore the changes) or the program every time.</seg>
<seg id="746">The Open site gives the ability to specify the behavior of & kgraphiviewer; to specify when a graph is opened outside a current session. you can specify a default behavior for this case (open the graph in a new window or in a subwindow of the already running session) or determine that each time is requested.</seg>
<seg id="747">The Seat Management page gives the possibility to specify the start behavior of & kgraphiviewer; you can specify a default behavior (open or not) or determine the files of the last session or decide to be asked for each start.</seg>

<seg id="749">Here you can choose from different & graphiviz; layout algorithms. the entries, as described on the & graphviz website, are:</seg>
<seg id="750">& dot; algorithm, the standard for directional graphs. it produces hierarchical or layered representations of aligned graphs. the algorithm places the edges in the same direction (from top to bottom or from left to right) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edges as possible.</seg>
<seg id="751">The & nato; algorithm is the standard for unfinished graphs. it produces displays according to the spring spring model. the Kamada-Kawai algorithm is used, which is synonymous with statistical multi-dimensional scaling.</seg>
<seg id="752">The & FDP; algorithm generates a springspring model for unexecuted graphs. it uses the Fruetman-Reingold heuristic, and includes a multi-grid trigger for the treatment of large and clustered graphs.</seg>
<seg id="753">The & Circo; algorithm assigns the nodes in a circular manner according to the description of Six and Tollis, 1999, and Kauffman and Wiese, 2002. it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cyclic structures.</seg>
<seg id="754">Open a dialog where you can specify a layout command, which will then be executed by a shell. the command should display the graph file as parameter, and output the calculated layout of the graph after stdout in xdot format. with such a layout command, you can specify special options, or change the graph with a filter before it is drawn.</seg>
<seg id="755">Specifies the type of graph (directed or executed) and applies the default algorithm for the respective type to (dot; for directional, & nato; for unexecuted graphs).</seg>

<seg id="773">This module can be used to read and save new images from external sources. currently, two sources can be used:</seg>
<seg id="774">Scan images: use the Kooka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the Sane project or another source such as Video Streams. to make this work you have to have kooka and sane installed.</seg>
<seg id="775">When you open the menu item images, a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer. select the source from which you want to pick up the image. you can also set the default source for the next time.</seg>
<seg id="776">After that, the Kooka window will pop up by selecting the default values ducrhe can replace your image accordingly. see the preview and adjust the area to your needs before you scan the image with the button. the estimated file size will be shown in the right, bottom corner. in the Kooka manual you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="777">Make sure the window is completely displayed, as some settings might not be displayed otherwise.</seg>
<seg id="778">After pressing the scanner you have to wait until the scan is finished and the window to specify the options of the target image appears. here you can specify the compression and type of the image file. please remember that the type BMP does not compress and therefore create very large files. you also need to select or create the folder & # 160; select or create the image.</seg>
<seg id="779">You can create screenshots after selecting Import &gt; Screen Photo... from the menu. a window appears where you can set the different screen settings:</seg>
<seg id="780">Select the entire desktop to read a single window under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="781">If all of your own program windows are selected, the calling program will disappear so that you can see other screens and windows. otherwise, after a short delay, you will read the currently visible workspace. if you have selected the complete desktop, only the window is read under the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="782">The delay determines how long screen shot is waiting before it starts. if you need to switch to other worktops, you should select this delay enough to have the time to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="783">After the screenshot has been created, the dialog will display options of the target image with the options described above.</seg>

<seg id="796">Flickr is an online photo management on the Internet. Flickr allows you to send your photos to people that are important. you can show your favorite photos of the world online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="797">The Export to Flickr module can be used to upload images from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="798">If you use the module for the first time, you will be guided through the process of generating a token. it is used for your authentication. it is thus virtually your identification to Flickr. a browser is started so you can login to Flickr.</seg>
<seg id="799">After successful registration, the module can send photos to the Flickr website. the following page will be presented after successful registration.</seg>
<seg id="800">Simply close the browser window and return to the program. after pressing Yes, you will get the dialog for uploading photos to Flickr. this will appear in the next section.</seg>
<seg id="801">If the module Export to Flickr is launched twice, you will be welcomed with the following dialog, which displays the current access permissions that the module displays. to upload, you need write permissions. the module does not currently support any other permissions. you will be asked if you wish to continue with these permissions.</seg>
<seg id="802">The button photos should be pressed once you have set all the other options. with this button, you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box. click the Ok button to start uploading the photos to the Flickr server.</seg>
<seg id="803">The keyword field can be filled with a comma separated list of words. these are added to the image as keywords during upload.</seg>
<seg id="804">With options Public, Friends and Famillie, you can set the permissions to your pictures. by default, the photos are classified as private.</seg>
<seg id="805">If you choose the option to change the size of the photos before uploading, the photos will be changed in size before uploading. the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size.</seg>
<seg id="806">The maximum size can be used to determine the maximum height of the images. the size is changed in such a way that the aspect ratio remains constant.</seg>

<seg id="809">The KIPI module for geographic localization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image. geographic data is stored in the EXIF keywords of the image and localization can be displayed in a map in an external browser.</seg>
<seg id="810">The KIPI geographic localization module provides tools to locate images geographically in the spherical coordinate system used by GPS and Galileo. height, length and width are used.</seg>
<seg id="811">To correlate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the gpx format. gpsbabel and gpsmen can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device.</seg>
<seg id="812">Image Geographical localization Correlator. this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track.</seg>
<seg id="813">Select the images you want to correlate in the main window and go to the menu. the above-looking dialog appears then. to maintain a possible correlation over time and localization, you will need to load a track file with GPX file. of course, this file contains data that were taken at the same locations at the same time as the images of your camera.</seg>
<seg id="814">If the file is loaded an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red. GPS track data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera vision must be recalculated with the GMT. this can be done with the time zone.</seg>
<seg id="815">The setting for maximum time deviation gives an upper deviation for the GPS time and camera vision. if the deviation is below, the data is merged. the maximum value is 2000 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="816">If you do not have track data from one location for images, you can manually edit the gpx file and add it to the images. the time difference of 2000 seconds will then correlate all the images in this area.</seg>
<seg id="817">The options interpolate and difference in minutes can be used if you have no matching data. if you know that in reality a location is located in a big time difference between camera and GPS, you can set these limits here and then press the button correlations to interpolate.</seg>
<seg id="818">The coordinates can be set manually with this dialog. this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place. since the dialog opens the coordinates from a call to the next, you only need to use the button OK to set the data in the current photo.</seg>
<seg id="819">The location can also be found and set using the displayed map. to do so, select the region and increase sie.Include this repeatedly until you have reached a sufficient accuracy. the height must always be selected manually. the card can be changed between map mode, satellite image and mixed mode.</seg>
<seg id="820">Completely outside the KIPI module, there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the pictures. here is a small script that uses the exiftool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data.</seg>
<seg id="821">The KIPI module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages.</seg>
<seg id="822">This module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.01. you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages. the character set is encoded UTF-8 to enable the best possible internationalization.</seg>
<seg id="823">The module has four tabs in which the settings can be adjusted. the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML. you just need to select these albums. with the three buttons on the right side you can quickly select a large number of albums. in the area below, the Albenvorschau and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page will appear.</seg>
<seg id="824">The rider's appearance defines the general look and layout for each page. this tab is largely self-explanatory. if you click on a picture, a new page will be created in which the image is displayed. otherwise, the image will be displayed directly with your default picture viewer, & eg; Kuickshow</seg>
<seg id="825">The tab defines the settings where and how to save the gallery with all your associated images. select a folder on which you have write permission. a subfolder named KIPIHTMLSuite containing everything will be created there.</seg>
<seg id="826">If you have selected the JPEG file format, the EXIF information of your original images will also be saved in the new images.</seg>
<seg id="827">With other color depth, you can change the default color depth. of course, it also influences file size. all other settings are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="828">The tab thumbnails allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for thumbnails, these are small images that are displayed in the gallery.</seg>
<seg id="829">A progress window shows the user how far the action is. press Cancel to cancel the process.</seg>
<seg id="830">If the module has created the pages, the window will not be automatically closed. you can therefore read the programs to see if errors occurred while generating. the web browser will automatically start to preview the gallery. press Close to close the module.</seg>
<seg id="831">The KIPI image viewer is a very fast and flexible OpenGL-based tool to view images.</seg>
<seg id="832">The KIPI Viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations like rotations, zooming or moving. the viewer can be used with short commands and masts. it has been developed for fast image display and quick access to its functions.</seg>
<seg id="833">After the start, a picture is displayed in full screen mode by default. this can be changed to a window mode.</seg>
<seg id="834">The KIPI JPEG Lossfree module is a tool for changing images without affecting your quality.</seg>
<seg id="835">This module allows you to store images in JPEG format for the actions listed below, without the usual losses of quality or metadata.</seg>
<seg id="836">The consequence of the loss-free storage is that the file size increases, because no compression of the color information takes place. this can also be found in PNG format.</seg>
<seg id="837">The KIPI digital camera client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer to a digital camera.</seg>
<seg id="838">The KIPI module digital camera client currently has no documentation. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="839">The KIPI module metadata editor currently has no documentation. if you want to change this situation, please contact the mailing list kde-imaging @ kde.org of the KIPI team.</seg>
<seg id="840">With the Import function of the metadata module, you can copy data from one image to another. to do so, select the image you want to copy in the main program and then call the Import function. this will open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image, i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata.</seg>
<seg id="841">This function does not work for all image formats. you can copy from anywhere but not write into any target format. JPEG is supported while writing. please look at exiv2 to see which formats are supported.</seg>
<seg id="842">The KIPI MPEG Codec module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="843">The MPEG Codimmer module can be used to convert selected images into a MPEG video, with a defined length, to convert. this module uses the MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages. you can also add a basic image transfer between the individual images. you can also add an audio file to the MP2 or WAV of the slideshow.</seg>
<seg id="844">All images are automatically scaled to the correct size for the selected video format. in addition, you can select a background color for the slideshow. with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XVCD / SVCD / VCD for your DVD player. finally, you can finally use the K3b program.</seg>
<seg id="845">You first need to select the images that should be packed into the MPEG Diashau. then you can create the module using Extras MPEG Diaschau.</seg>
<seg id="846">The images selected by you are then listed under image files in the portfolio. there you can also change sorting of images or the contents of the list.</seg>
<seg id="847">After you are satisfied with your list, you should adjust the other settings. the video format can be selected from various formats, DVD, XVCD, SVCD and VCD. if you plan to replay the file on a TV, you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL, SECAM or NTSC. PAL is pre-set and most likely the right choice for Europe.</seg>
<seg id="848">In the next step you should specify the time in seconds that will display a picture. the speed of the image transition is defined below. a low value creates very sudden, a high contrast very smooth picture change.</seg>
<seg id="849">The background color can be set next. in case of doubt, you should leave it black. you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file.</seg>
<seg id="850">If you specify an audio file with the name of the audio source file, it will be integrated into the movie. after you have adjusted all settings to your needs, you can use the button encoding the creation of the movie. depending on the speed of your computer you can now go fast or in all silence to enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back.</seg>
<seg id="851">If a note appears that encoders or tools are missing, you can customize the paths to the programs of MjpegTools and ImageMagick packages via the Settings button at the bottom.</seg>
<seg id="852">The printer wizard allows you to print multiple images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes. these combined images can also be automatically opened using image processing Gimp. this is e.g: useful to improve or print directly with the Gimp module.</seg>
<seg id="853">With this KIPI module, you can import or convert your images stored in RAW format into one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM.</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-line tool dcraw by Dave Coffin. an original quote from Him is: expect drapw not to create the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer. sometimes you get better results with drapw!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file to be converted and start the module. the Raw image converter window then appears in mode for a single image. with the Preview button you can view the effect of your current settings on the image.</seg>
<seg id="856">You can now re-adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later.</seg>
<seg id="857">A four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to enable you to use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect.</seg>
<seg id="858">Once you are satisfied with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossless algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes.</seg>
<seg id="859">The Tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all the information of your image and uses the lossless LZW compression.</seg>
<seg id="860">If you are planning to process your images frequently, or if you later intend to use it elsewhere, you should not choose JPEG format because it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to retain the original data.</seg>
<seg id="861">If you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that is contained in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information.</seg>
<seg id="862">If you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the output button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="863">Batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are certain, e.g. by testing on a single image that are the best settings.</seg>
<seg id="864">The available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have the possibility to overwrite existing files. this is helpful if they were created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed.</seg>
<seg id="865">This module can be used to compress all images in one album. it also uses the program convert from the ImageMagick package. the following image formats are supported:</seg>
<seg id="866">This module can be used to rename all images of an album. you can set the prefix, the starting number and the timestamp of the album.</seg>
<seg id="867">This module can be used to change the size of several images of an image collection. it uses the convert program from the ImageMagick package. you can zoom or enlarge the image.</seg>
<seg id="868">Proportional (1 Dim.): normal size change in a dimension. width or height of the image is selected automatically, depending on image orientation. the aspect ratio remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="869">Proportional (2 Dim.): size change in two dimensions. here, the aspect ratio remains unchanged. you can use this option, for example, to adjust your image to the screen format.</seg>
<seg id="870">Not proportional: no proportional size change in two dimensions. the aspect ratio is changed with this option.</seg>
<seg id="871">Printing Prepare: prepares the image for photo printing. the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper. the target image, including background size, border size and background color, is adjusted accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="872">With this KIPI module you can send selected images with your preferred e-mail program. it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before. more images can drag and drop them to the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="873">After you have launched the module, the image window will be displayed with the images you have selected. you can add more images using a file selection dialog. for the last selected image, a preview will be shown on the right.</seg>
<seg id="874">You can also drag images to the picture list and put it there to add the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="875">With the Pictures button remove the selected images from the list of images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="876">After you have selected all the images, you can open the new message window of your e-mail client with the button OK. you only have to add the addresses and the subject here. the images selected by you are attached as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="877">Make sure not to send too many images at once. most email accounts have restrictions on the size of e-mails sent. it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send many pictures.</seg>
<seg id="878">The email window is used to change settings for sending images. your configuration is saved and used every time you change it.</seg>
<seg id="879">Select your email client from the menu. if you select Thunderbird, you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below.</seg>
<seg id="880">If you are using the Google Mail service, you must first install the Gmail agent on your computer. you can download it here.</seg>
<seg id="881">After selecting comments in a attached file, the comments on the images will be merged into a text file and the mail is enclosed.</seg>
<seg id="882">The PNG format under the File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files, but it is best adapted to lossless formats such as TIFF. therefore, you should use PNG if you have a fast internet connection and do not want to change the photo quality. otherwise, we recommend the JPEG format.</seg>
<seg id="883">If you select JPEG image file format and the original files are in JPEG format then the original ifconfig files will be added to the images to be sent.</seg>
<seg id="884">When the process is finished, the window will not be closed automatically so that you can view the status messages in search of errors. however, your e-mail program will automatically start at the end.</seg>
<seg id="885">After starting the module Advanced Diaschau a window with questions like you want to show your slideshow will appear. you can choose between the selected and all pictures of the album.</seg>
<seg id="886">The OpenGL transitions in the presentation enable very elegant image transitions with OpenGL. however, you must have a corresponding graphic card, otherwise the slide show will be very slow.</seg>
<seg id="887">The Show filename option ensures that the filename of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation.</seg>
<seg id="888">The loop option ensures that the presentation is displayed in a loop. you can then cancel it manually with Esc; Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="889">The option images randomly select ensures that the images are displayed in a random order. so it is not used the order of images in the album.</seg>
<seg id="890">The time distance between the pictures can be set between the pictures. 1500 milliseconds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value. however, the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect. so you should test it before you show your friends!</seg>
<seg id="891">There are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose. randomly, each transition between the images selects a different effect.</seg>
<seg id="892">During slide show, you can access a toolbar at the top left of the screen. move the mouse to this corner to turn on.</seg>
<seg id="893">With this tool bar you can stop the presentation and start again, jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show.</seg>
<seg id="894">At the bottom of the screen you can see the current filename, the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation.</seg>
<seg id="895">The KIPI module Time & Date has no documentation at the moment. if you are interested in writing this, please contact the mailing list of the KIPI team at kde-imaging @ kde.org. attention: the participants of this list speak English.</seg>
<seg id="896">The KIPI module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the working surface.</seg>
<seg id="897">This module sets the currently selected image, depending on the selected option of the submenu, as background for your KDE desktop.</seg>
<seg id="898">As soon as you have completed your pictures and videos with notes, you can browse with & kphotoalbum; by these browsing, see picture. as you can see through a comparison with the picture, are now available in each group, i.e. in persons, places and in the group keyword entries.</seg>
<seg id="899">In the browser window you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with notes. in addition, there are entries to look for EXIF based information, view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course look at the current thumbnails.</seg>
<seg id="900">When you press the mouse over the entry, the view of the browser changes. see picture.</seg>
<seg id="901">If you select another person, only the images displayed on which both persons can be seen. by using this selection method, you can restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few individual images.</seg>
<seg id="902">When you have selected all the people, locations and other settings, you can view thumbnails to view the images in your area of action.</seg>
<seg id="903">In the picture each person has the same icon before their name. you can save with & kphotoalbum; however, for each person you can save your own thumbnail, this also applies to places, keywords and other categories that you have defined.</seg>
<seg id="904">To view images in addition to the names, select the button located on the right outside of the toolbar. in the appearing context menu, you can select which view you need to use for the current category. this has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of persons and at the same time a list of keywords (if you don't have suitable images for your keywords).</seg>
<seg id="905">However, you must decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual. to do this, you will need to open the image review window (described in more detail) and select the image for the appropriate person in the context menu. here you can select the image for the appropriate person. in the check window, you can adjust the magnification factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image is to be displayed or cut off.</seg>
<seg id="906">When you search for the search in the main window, a dialog appears, which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties. you can view this dialog once again on the image.</seg>
<seg id="907">If you enter a string in the field labeling or description, the captions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text. if you want, you can also enter a date for searching; the date can be either a part of the total dataset, i.e. 1971, or the complete date. you can also use a range of two dates, such as 1971-1980.</seg>
<seg id="908">With the options in the lower part of the window, you can browse all images on specific names as you can see in the picture. click here for pictures on which Jesper, but not Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="909">This is the user manual for & kphotoalbum; if you don't like to read manuals but rather try the same functions, you have the following alternatives to this manual:</seg>
<seg id="910">Go to the homepage of & kphotoalbum; and take a look at the quick entry, the screenshots and the introductory videos.</seg>
<seg id="911">Start & kphotoalbum; and in the first dialog, start the demo, if you start & kphotoalbum; start the first time, or select the menu entry in the menu Help menu. then some sample images are loaded and you can try the features of & kphotoalbum; try it.</seg>
<seg id="912">If you prefer to print this handbook, you can find it on the homepage of & kphotoalbum; as a coherent HTML document to download.</seg>
<seg id="913">At the bottom of the main window of & kphotoalbum; see the timeline. a picture of this bar can be seen here:. as the name suggests, this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database.</seg>
<seg id="914">The timeline can display several different time units. each bar then displays another unit. you can switch between units years, months, weeks, hours and 10 minutes. on the picture you can see a part of a database by displaying only 10-minute sections.</seg>
<seg id="915">The timeline can be used interactively in the following ways: you can change the displayed entries preview view from the database (if you select a date, the first image will display this date in the preview pane) and the timeline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate in the preview pane.</seg>
<seg id="916">You can also select a section of the timeline by holding the mouse button pressed and drag the mouse over the ruler of the timeline, i.e. the time data. if you select an area, you will only see images of this time in the preview pane. you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the timeline.</seg>
<seg id="917">& kphotoalbum; provides you two possibilities to create HTML websites with your pictures. the one is in & kphotoalbum; integrated and the other as module available (see). in the following part of the user manual, the in & kphotoalbum; integrated version is described, which you can create via the menu file HTML...</seg>
<seg id="918">Before HTML pages are created you need to make some settings. these are divided into the three areas of content, layout and finish. in the following, each section is described more accurately.</seg>
<seg id="919">First, enter the title of the title and a description that the HTML file should contain later. on kphotoalbum; HTML sample pages you see an example of these settings.</seg>
<seg id="920">Next, select if a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created which is shown on the overview page. more information about the export files can be found in.</seg>
<seg id="921">Finally, you can select which information should be displayed on the HTML pages. thus, you can avoid that information displayed to the viewer is obvious even without description. for example, that all pictures are displayed by a party. note that all pictures are exported. you can therefore not use this setting to hide specific pictures from certain viewers.</seg>
<seg id="922">In this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why it is not specifically discussed.</seg>
<seg id="923">At the bottom of this page you can set up different resolutions for the images, so those who want to view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600 will not download images that have, for example, a resolution of 1600x1200.</seg>
<seg id="924">The viewers of your site can change the resolution at any time you set. so it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transmission time. if it wants to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution.</seg>
<seg id="925">In this setting area you specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored.</seg>
<seg id="926">The best way to select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set.</seg>
<seg id="927">First, select the main folder where all your images will be saved. this folder will be saved and added automatically next time. this allows you to specify the location for all future pictures. here you can select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:</seg>
<seg id="928">After you have created your images, you can check if they are all visible to viewers. if you choose a URL for the base folder, a web browser after the pages have been created will be launched. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder.</seg>
<seg id="929">If the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you need to manually copy them to it. in order for the import function, see, properly, you have to specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located.</seg>
<seg id="930">The setting options described above have related all three to base folders and URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in the output folder.</seg>
<seg id="931">If you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or somewhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; come together, you might want to create an HTML page for viewing the pictures. however, if you have spent a lot of time looking for image information, persons on the pictures, recording location, etc. then you have to do this work again.</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images into a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are exported with ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if only a link to images is stored in the file. the advantage of storing all images in the file is that you have all the pictures together and that file can be passed on as independent. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size.</seg>
<seg id="934">You can either export a .kim file directly from the Export menu... or together with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="935">An external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are in the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you have specified when creating the HTML files will be searched. this is of course only possible if you created your .kim file using the HTML export.</seg>
<seg id="936">In the following the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the Export... menu.</seg>
<seg id="937">The main option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">With the Manually copy option to the .kim file, you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .kim file.</seg>
<seg id="939">With the Automatisch option to copy near the .kim file copy & kphotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal Zip files. since most images have been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files. if you want to do so, simply select the Export File option.</seg>
<seg id="941">The last option of this page is maximum picture size limit. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the pictures in full size as the .kim file would otherwise be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide.</seg>
<seg id="942">If you select a file with extension .kim from the web browser or from the File menu... select, & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in.</seg>
<seg id="943">The wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then in which folders the import images are to be copied.</seg>
<seg id="944">It may be that you specify the category persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is called persons. therefore, in the third dialogue window, you will be asked in the third dialogue window to import the categories of the file to be imported and what categories they match in your database.</seg>
<seg id="945">In the fourth step you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. an example can be seen in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="946">It has to be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted.</seg>
<seg id="947">In this manual you will see the various steps of (1) specifying the information about your images, about (2) searching and viewing, up to (3) advanced topics and customization options.</seg>
<seg id="948">KPhotoalbum has been started as a program to manage your pictures. it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos. in many places in this manual it is talked about pictures, but frequently this also includes videos with one.</seg>
<seg id="949">& kphotoalbum; stores all its information in the file index.xml in the topmost folder of your images. it is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice, e.g. Normal backup tools, copy to a floppy or revisions in CVS, where you want it.</seg>
<seg id="950">& kphotoalbum; remembers the folder where your images are stored and automatically use it for future starts. if you want to read another database in & kphotoalbum, you can start & kphotoalbum; with the -c option. as an example: kphotoalbum -c ~ / Company / Pictures / index.xml.</seg>
<seg id="951">The menu entry Settings kphotoalbum; set up... you can get to a window with which you can change the settings of & kphotoalbum; in the following section of the user manual you will be able to explain the different settings.</seg>
<seg id="952">To the left you can see six different symbols, with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer. for each setting a detailed help is available, which you can call by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option.</seg>
<seg id="953">It describes how you can define different properties for each picture, e.g. persons, locations and keywords. you can also create your own groups like objects, animals or albums.</seg>
<seg id="954">See the dialog used to edit existing groups. for each group you can select a label and a symbol.</seg>
<seg id="955">In the Options section, subcategories have already been mentioned. in the Options dialog you can set up complete member groups, i.e., for example, all members of a group at once in a group instead of all groups of a member as explained in.</seg>
<seg id="956">In the list of options listed above, you can select the category you want to configure. in the left half of the window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of subcategories.</seg>
<seg id="957">& kphotoalbum; shares his modular system with other graphic applications, such as digiKam and Gwenview. this module system is called KIPI and means & kde; Image plugin interface. more information about this can be found on the Kipi homepage.</seg>
<seg id="958">The modules can be called up via the modules menu. the modules can and will not be described in this manual, since they are not part of & kphotoalbum; however, most modules have a help page that you can access via the module itself.</seg>
<seg id="959">Since the modules of several applications are used together, it may be that the modules with & kphotoalbum are tested; therefore, you should always test new modules with the demo database before using them on your own pictures with the command &gt; kphotoalbum demo &lt; userinput\ &gt; or via the Help menu. do not say I would not have warned you!</seg>
<seg id="960">The applications that the modules share via KIPI are very different, whereby it can be that some modules with & kphotoalbum; do not work. this is the disadvantage when you share functions with different applications.</seg>
<seg id="961">The biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications that KIPI also use is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums. even if & kphotoalbum; this sort of order does not support, it simulates for some modules the order to albums so that you can use the functions with & kphotoalbum;</seg>
<seg id="962">This simulates & kphotoalbum; the current album, which is just the current view, so all images that show you the picture preview right now.</seg>
<seg id="963">Next to the current album, & kphotoalbum; the modules also have a list of albums. here goes & kphotoalbum; as follows:</seg>
<seg id="964">If & kphotoalbum; s Browser shows the content of a category, e.g. all persons, then each entry in this category represents an album for the module.</seg>
<seg id="965">Or it will use the category you set in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums. so, for example, if you use the category people, & kphotoalbum; so do so, so if you have selected people to view and pass this on to the module.</seg>
<seg id="966">Since some modules with & kphotoalbum are not compatible, you can remove them from the list of modules. to do so, start the setup dialog and select modules to load modules.</seg>
<seg id="967">On the picture you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you & kphotoalbum; start with your own pictures.</seg>
<seg id="968">As you are used by any other KDE application, you can see at the top a menu bar and a toolbar. under the toolbar you can see the window that you have entered your image database. in the following section, we will return to this window, but now click on the picture that shows you an overview of all existing pictures.</seg>
<seg id="969">One of the main functions of & kphotoalbum; is the possibility to see any picture with annotations. this includes information about the people who are shown in the picture, etc. you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time. if for example on all pictures Jesper is pictured and all pictures taken in Copenhagen.</seg>
<seg id="970">All these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section. if you want you can see these comments if you are using the built-in viewer.</seg>
<seg id="971">See three lists with a text box by setting people, locations and keywords. these are a very important part of & kphotoalbum; since you can always use them again whenever you enter information about your pictures.</seg>
<seg id="972">The following idea is based on moving images within the list: for example, if you have a family celebration and on all 50 pictures the same 5-10 persons are shown, you can, by moving the names used up, find and assign the people more quickly.</seg>
<seg id="973">If you prefer to get an alphabetically sorted list, click on the symbol for sorting by date under the list.</seg>
<seg id="974">If you have selected annotations for each picture individually, you might want to edit all selected images and have these pictures with notes. in this case, simply click the one before and back buttons, which are below the thumbnail to the right.</seg>
<seg id="975">If you have recorded several images, e.g. with the same person, then it can be more convenient to select all these images and use the menu item Multiple Messages at once with a note.</seg>
<seg id="976">Las Vegas, San Francisco, Los Angeles and California are all located in the U.S.. in addition, San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California.</seg>
<seg id="977">The picture shows a browser window that displays the USA as an overlap. to show you that it is an overlap, a special symbol is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="978">In the context menu of the comment dialog it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over- or subcategory. in addition, you can also simply drag an entry into a category and drop it down to make it a subcategory of this entry. attention, this presupposes that you just sort your categories alphabetically.</seg>
<seg id="979">You can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bars that form the top edge of the frame. you can also make your own window from a frame by drawing it outside the window area.</seg>
<seg id="980">If you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs so that you are satisfied with the settings, click the Options button... which offers among other things the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window.</seg>
<seg id="981">You can also fade out a frame completely. if you want to see this window again later, use the Options button... and then add / hide windows. this process you will see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="982">If you select the display pictures in the browser, you will get an overview with thumbnails of the currently selected images, or all images if you have not set filters. an example of this can be seen here. you can configure the size of thumbnails by simply dragging the mouse with the middle mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="983">If you drop a picture on the background of your desktop, this image will be set as a background image for your desktop.</seg>
<seg id="984">Once you click on a picture, it will appear in the picture viewer. if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer, a new display window will be created.</seg>
<seg id="985">You can also delete images in the preview window. simply select the appropriate images you want to delete and press either the Remove button or select Delete from the Edit menu. now you will see the window that you can see in the picture.</seg>
<seg id="986">& kphotoalbum; offers you a solution for this problem. you can also use & kphotoalbum; you can also have the pictures stored somewhere, so that & kphotoalbum; you can record the view of & kphotoalbum; in the picture you see the view of & kphotoalbum; if not all the needed pictures can be loaded from the hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="987">Images in which the right upper corner is truncated are not stored on the hard drive. however, the thumbnails are available for the pictures 5-9. however, the thumbnails are present for the pictures 5-9. however, you can't view these pictures with the image viewer.</seg>
<seg id="988">As you can see, this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy it back into it. if you want to avoid hassle about how to avoid mess of your pictures, please buy a larger disk to store all images on it.</seg>
<seg id="989">In the menu pictures you will find a sub-menu with the name privacy. if you want to have a little more privacy, filter the images in such a way that at the end ones you want to disable for others and click Recent view lock in the menu Privacy. alternatively, you can also view all the images that your little sister may view, control and block the menu item All except current view.</seg>
<seg id="990">This allows you to set which images are to be hidden in the case of the case. if you now give your laptop to your little sister, simply select the menu item images, so that all images you have blocked can be hidden. if you want to get the images displayed again, click on lock.</seg>
<seg id="991">It is also possible to specify a password which must be entered to unlock the images. to set up this password, simply select Password in the Privacy menu.</seg>
<seg id="992">Please keep in mind that this protection is not very safe. on the one hand, all images on the hard disk and on the other everyone can access or delete the password as unencrypted text. this type of password protection is only for those who are familiar with & kphotoalbum; not very familiar to look at the view of private images.</seg>
<seg id="993">The reason you are all your pictures with & kphotoalbum; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to look at them sometime. for this reason, & kphotoalbum; on a picture _ and video viewer. you can start this from the preview as described in.</seg>
<seg id="994">You can see the viewer in it. of course it shows the image, but additional all the information you have entered through the image, such as who is on the picture, when and where it was made, etc.</seg>
<seg id="995">If the infobox on the upper part of the picture you want to see, you can drag it with the mouse and put it elsewhere. you can also configure which information is displayed and whether information should be displayed at all. all of these options are available after right-clicking on the viewer.</seg>
<seg id="996">Some words in the infobox are underlined. if you click here the browser, see the matching entries to this display. so if you click on Anne Helene, the browser will show you all pictures of Anne Helene. as if you have selected people from the browser and then Anne Helene.</seg>
<seg id="997">If you have uploaded several images in the viewer, you can switch between them before and back by clicking the image high and the image down. you can jump to the first and last image with Pos1 and End. these functions can also be reached from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="998">If several images are loaded in the viewer, you can run them as slide show. then a new image loads after a few seconds. how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the Ctrl key and plus or minus.</seg>
<seg id="999">A very useful feature of the viewer of & kphotoalbum; it is able to switch to full screen mode. in this mode, the viewer uses the complete space on the screen. just use the input key to switch back to full screen mode and back.</seg>
<seg id="1000">When you use the viewer you can zoom in and zoom out. to zoom in, you can simply draw a rectangle with the mouse. with the minus button you can zoom out again The Plus button zooming in the middle of the picture. shows how a zoom rectangle is selected and shows the result of the zoom.</seg>
<seg id="1001">With the dot key you can reset your zoom, so that the image is not zoomed. with the uniformity key sets the zoom so that every pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image.</seg>
<seg id="1002">Note that the only zoom operations that work with videos that are in and out are with the plus and minusaste.</seg>
<seg id="1003">With the script functions from the context menu, you can rotate the image. this does not work for videos. you can make comments on the current image with the menu item Remarks from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1004">If you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture. at the moment you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter these names. however, you may prefer to mark only the picture and view more pictures.</seg>
<seg id="1005">Another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper. to see which photos you want, you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while watching one by one.</seg>
<seg id="1006">For the two examples above, the viewer gives you the opportunity to see pictures with features while you look at them. characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can make a feature that you press the corresponding letter. in see a picture where the features A, B and C are set.</seg>
<seg id="1007">As soon as you have set features on your images, you can see them in your browser. so, if you have all the images you edit, print or whatever you have selected, just add them all at once. this is described in. after that, you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do.</seg>
<seg id="1008">Categories and special features can be displayed in preview screen. if you can view categories in the preview view, then you can add features to the pictures by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected. this can be seen here:</seg>
<seg id="1009">Sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture. for this case, you will be allowed to paint on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="1010">The chamois is not stored with the image, but in the database. in this way you can undo your painted later.</seg>
<seg id="1011">In, you can see a picture on which was painted. to switch the painting mode of & kphotoalbum; switch on the picture color from the context menu. to finish the painting, simply press the cross in the toolbar at the top of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1012">To be able to work with & kpovmodeler; you must have the application of the program & Povray; not fully dominate, but the documentation on & Povray; you should have read and understood.</seg>
<seg id="1013">In the object tree you can select individual objects. then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire model views yellow.</seg>
<seg id="1014">You can also select multiple objects at the same time, but not the object of an object that is already selected, since all objects are already selected with the object.</seg>
<seg id="1015">To insert a new object in the object tree, select the position where you want to insert the object and either click on the toolbar icon or select a menu entry in the Insert menu.</seg>
<seg id="1016">If there are several possible positions, the following drop-down menu appears, so that you can choose the correct position:</seg>
<seg id="1017">You can remove selected objects from the scene with deleting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="1018">If you have changed properties, click Apply to take these changes. if you entered invalid values, a message will be displayed with a fault description. then you can correct the input errors and click Apply or discard the changes with Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="1019">If you enter the path to & Povray; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog, you can call the & Povray; reference to the displayed object with help.</seg>
<seg id="1020">You need the & Povray; 3.1g or 3.5 HMTL user documentation to use this feature. if this documentation is not included in your distribution, you can download it here. & Povray; 3.5 already contains the user documentation.</seg>
<seg id="1021">When you edit a texture or part of a texture, you can see a preview in the properties pane.</seg>
<seg id="1022">Press preview in the properties pane and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture. as default the whole texture is rendered, even if you want to render a part of the texture (for example a texture inside a texture map and not the whole texture map), cross local.</seg>
<seg id="1023">The screen shot shows the control points of the camera. you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1024">When a transformation is selected, the control points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wire model view. this cross marks the center for scaling and rotation as well as the position for shifts. you can change the shift by pulling with the mouse within the entire window.</seg>
<seg id="1025">Each object has a Visibility level as a wire model. you can specify this value relative to the Visibility level of the higher-level object or as absolute value. objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the Visibility level chosen in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1026">& kpovmodeler; has a window arrangement as default. the object tree and the view of the object properties are shown on the left and the four graphic views on the right.</seg>
<seg id="1027">If you don't like the default window arrangement, or if you need another arrangement, you can set them arbitrarily. you can also store multiple window orders and easily switch between different configurations.</seg>
<seg id="1028">To anchor a window over or below a view, drag the beginner to the top or bottom of a view. a rectangle then displays the new position.</seg>
<seg id="1029">To create a new column, drag the beginner to the right or left side of a view. the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the whole height.</seg>
<seg id="1030">If you want to arrange multiple views over each other, drag the beginner right in the middle of a different view. you can then switch between views by clicking on the tab card in the top of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1031">The last possible window arrangement is floating views: views that are not anchored in the main window. to solve a view from the anchorage, drag the beginner to the desktop or click on the small arrow pointing upwards in the beginning bar.</seg>
<seg id="1032">To close a view, click on the small cross in the beginning bar. to prevent closing, click on the small square between the arrow and the cross.</seg>
<seg id="1033">You can insert additional views into the main window. in the View menu, you can find entries for each type of view. new views are floating, you can anchor them at any point.</seg>
<seg id="1034">The current window view can be saved with View window arrangement... saving. a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name.</seg>
<seg id="1035">If you have created a scene, you can render them render. & kpovmodeler; used & Povray; 3.1g for rendering, this program must be properly installed. as this manual was written, & Povray; 3.5 topical. this version is not supported in & kpovmodeler; version 1.0.</seg>
<seg id="1036">To render the current scene, click the Renders icon in the toolbar or select the View scene menu item.</seg>
<seg id="1037">A render mode corresponds to the entries in & Povray; s ini files. it determines the image size and quality of rendering. if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels, you can insert any number of render modes, from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality.</seg>
<seg id="1038">If you click on the render settings icon in the toolbar or in the View Render Mode menu, the following dialog will be opened:</seg>
<seg id="1039">Each render mode has a name. you can enter any name, but useful is a name that lets you know the properties of the mode.</seg>
<seg id="1040">In the map file size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image. if you want to render only a small area of the image, select the check box subsection and enter the image section for rendering to the input fields.</seg>
<seg id="1041">In the combination field quality you can select the properties, the & Povray; used for rendering. this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex-diffuse reflection lighting. a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user manual & Povray;.</seg>
<seg id="1042">If a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel, several errors can occur. these images often have a moiré pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing.</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">If you switch on anti-aliasing, calculates and connects & Povray; more than one beam per pixel. this technique is super sampling.</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive, because the super sampling gets the adjacent pixels with one. the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursive because every pixel is always further divided and adapted because the recursion depth depends on the calculated colours.</seg>
<seg id="1046">If you choose the first method, POV-Ray uses a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the neighbouring pixels exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are processed by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 is calculated, with a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1047">The difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel.</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">The recursive method starts with 4 rays per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the specified threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subpixels that are individually followed and checked for further subdivision. the maximum depth of the recursion can be adjusted with the depth value.</seg>
<seg id="1050">Another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process called Jittering. if you turn on jittering, change & Povray; the rays are a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns.</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; the diffuse light reflexion is calculated. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>
<seg id="1052">On this map you can set whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV-Ray. a pixel is then transparent if the associated rays have no object.</seg>
<seg id="1053">Opens a new window for displaying the & Povray; console output. if & Povray; unexpectedly ends, you can find the reason for it here.</seg>
<seg id="1054">To import a & Povray; select Import the menu item file... and select a file in the dialog box.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Currently supported & kpovmodeler; not yet the complete command range of & Povray; when importing error messages or warnings, a dialog box displays a list of all messages.</seg>
<seg id="1056">If you do not support source text in & kpovmodeler; you want to import this source code between the two special comments / / * PMRawBegin and / / * PMRawEnd.</seg>
<seg id="1057">You can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for & Povray; this adds to the source text of the object into the open text file in the editor. to import objects to the scene, simply select the source text in the editor and drag it into the object tree.</seg>
<seg id="1058">With copy and paste in & kpovmodeler; and in your editor you can insert source text for & Povray; also insert.</seg>
<seg id="1059">The POV-Ray command is called if & kpovmodeler; render a scene. usually this is povray or x-povray.</seg>
<seg id="1060">If you click on Help in the property view, & kpovmodeler; the & Povray; User Documentation on the displayed object. set here the path to your document and version. supports versions 3.1g and 3.5.</seg>
<seg id="1061">& Povray; searches for external files (e.g. height field data) in the paths to the & Povray; libraries. if you include files that are not in the scene file, you also need to enter the path to these files here. if a file is found in different paths of the library, the first found file is used.</seg>
<seg id="1062">The second color is used for displaying the selected objects.</seg>
<seg id="1063">The color for the control points. the second color is used for displaying the selected control points.</seg>
<seg id="1064">The color of the rectangle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type plates.</seg>
<seg id="1065">You can set the object-start of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wiremodel views. you can set the grid separately for shifts, scaling and turns.</seg>
<seg id="1066">Larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approximation for the displayed objects, but require more time to render. for some objects such as the ball, you can adjust the detail level separately for two directions.</seg>
<seg id="1067">If you cross high level of detail for extended projections, all wiredesign views will be further divided when the camera uses an extended projection. extended projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projection. this property results in better approximation for projections, but requires more time to render.</seg>
<seg id="1068">If you cross the wall, a wall behind the objects is rendered. the wall is represented in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1069">If you cross soil, a bottom is rendered underneath the objects. the bottom is represented in a checkerboard pattern from two adjustable colors.</seg>
<seg id="1070">When you check edge smoothing, the non-recursive anti-aliasing method is used for rendering the scenes. the values for depth and swelling value can be set. exact information on the parameters can be found in the Render-Modi section.</seg>
<seg id="1071">On this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders. in the window arrangement section it explains how to create and save window orders.</seg>
<seg id="1072">The Combination field Standard window arrangement: shows all existing window orders. & kpovmodeler; uses the chosen window arrangement when starting the program.</seg>
<seg id="1073">The list of existing window orders displays all existing window orders. a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the button Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Every window arrangement is identified by the name. the name must be unique and must not be empty.</seg>
<seg id="1075">The list below the name displays all views of the selected window arrangement. you can create new views with the Add button and delete selected views with the Remove button.</seg>
<seg id="1076">With New Column, create a new column on the right of the existing window, with Unten anchoring the window under the existing window, with tab card you get a map map view together with the previous view and floating anchored the view not in the main window, but creates a separate window.</seg>
<seg id="1077">So you have just & Povray; and & kpovmodeler; install and now you want to start without a more precise knowledge of both programs. if you follow all steps in this guide, you should create the ultimate but simple scene, among beginners very popular: a ball on one level.</seg>
<seg id="1078">But you should carefully consider the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result. if you are using a 3D program for the first time, you should observe these important rules:</seg>
<seg id="1079">If you do not set a camera, no rules can be applied to rendering, as a result you get a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1080">If you do not insert light sources, your whole scene lies in the dark and you will get only a black picture.</seg>
<seg id="1081">If you have installed everything correctly, you will see at the first start of & kpovmodeler; the following pre-set window arrangement:</seg>
<seg id="1082">Take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the toolbar. please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program.</seg>
<seg id="1083">You will need to use these menus and symbols often, so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their application.</seg>
<seg id="1084">& kpovmodeler; starts with a simple scene. to follow this guide, you first need to remove all objects from the object tree. select the scene and then select the menu item Edit Delete. thus, you now have a scene without objects.</seg>
<seg id="1085">The wire model view shows how the camera looks at the whole scene you create. in particular, you will notice that in the fourth wire model view (right below). this is the view of the scene from the point of view of the camera. this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1086">The object tree now contains a new entry called Camera. if you click on it, you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found. in the User Documentation to & Povray, you will find further details.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Change nothing to the basic settings of the camera, this is subject to later instructions, but note that the camera in view has checkpoints, with which you can change the target point of the camera. simply click with the left mouse button on a checkpoint and drag it to the desired location.</seg>
<seg id="1088">When pressing the button or pressing the button, the wirepiece views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings. as a result, they see the scene from the point of view of the camera.</seg>
<seg id="1089">There are many ways to create the ground for the scene. you could, for example, insert a box (insert final body boxes) and adjust the size to x = 100, y = 0 and z = 100, but this is a cumbersome method for solving this task.</seg>
<seg id="1090">& kpovmodeler; actually provides a simpler option. you can use an infinite plane as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1091">A good advice: select the layer in the object tree, change the name and then press the user button or the Enter key. in the object tree, the new name will be displayed immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1092">The wire model view now also displays the level, albeit at the moment only as a limited finite plane. if you render the scene, the plane expands to the horizon.</seg>
<seg id="1093">When you look at the object tree exactly, you will find that you can fold the entry for the ground if you click on the icon + in front of the object. in this case you will only see the default options for each new object: scaling, rotation and shifting. select one of these options, also change the possible settings in the view of the object properties.</seg>
<seg id="1094">In this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit under the horizontal line, only to get to know some of these parameters. choose shift and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1095">First select the ground to adjust its material properties. there are many different materials, but at the moment select something simple.</seg>
<seg id="1096">In both cases a dialog opens, where you can select how the object should be inserted. please select First Subject. the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree. you can view the name in the property view (name = bottom pigment), with a click on the Preview button you see how the pigment is now.</seg>
<seg id="1097">Of course, the preview of the pigment only shows a matt black material because you still have to enter settings for the pigment. therefore always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview.</seg>
<seg id="1098">If you don't see any color on the box and ball in the preview, click the Apply button and then get the preview.</seg>
<seg id="1099">The material for the floor is now set correctly. if you now render your picture with a click on the icon, you should get the following result:</seg>
<seg id="1100">Of course, this is not the color you expected. in the color list you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. in the object tree you need to enter two new attributes, called Unicoloured. then edit this entry twice (you can also do this more often, but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors):</seg>
<seg id="1101">In the object tree, select monochrome and change colors in the object properties view:</seg>
<seg id="1102">This step should already be done simply because you should have already understood the basic working method of & kpovmodeler; the ball can be created just as easy as the ground:</seg>
<seg id="1103">In the view of property properties, you can instantly change the settings. set the value for the radius: to 1 (do not forget to press the Enter key or button Applying), so the ball has contact with the floor. otherwise, the ball would float above the ground as you have moved the ground around one unit downwards.</seg>
<seg id="1104">Of course the rendering results in a strange result: as seen before, the ball surface appears like a matte black material. in the next step, put a suitable material.</seg>
<seg id="1105">If you have selected the ball, you can now assign a material to it. as already at the bottom, give the ball a pigment as a color:</seg>
<seg id="1106">Select First Subject and change the name for example in ball Pigment. click Ball Pigment, then select Unicoloured and set the values as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1107">But you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish features:</seg>
<seg id="1108">Then change the values as in the following screenshots and click Apply or press Enter.</seg>
<seg id="1109">The settings shine-effect and reflection partly result in good visual effects, perfect for glass or chromed surfaces, even if metallic: not yet selected:</seg>
<seg id="1110">You should now have a good impression of what options you & kpovmodeler offers; hopefully, you have already learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes.</seg>
<seg id="1111">Raytracycing is a render method to create a two-dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or model.</seg>
<seg id="1112">When you raytracing a scene, the renderer shoots hypothetical rays from the viewer's perspective (i.e. from the camera that renders the scenes) by every pixel in the scene. the render calculates how this ray is reflected by the objects and how atmospheric effects such as fog affect.</seg>
<seg id="1113">As you can imagine, you will not see anything without a camera, the camera is your eye with which you view the scene. without a light source you also see nothing, the image is simply black. obviously, every scene needs to be rendered, some light sources and at least one camera.</seg>
<seg id="1114">In the usual file dialog you can select your file. Povray files usually have the file extension * .pov or * .inc.</seg>
<seg id="1115">Opens a file. in the default file dialog you can select a file you previously created with & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1116">Whenever you open or create a new model, the file will be inserted into this submenu and replaces the oldest entry in the list.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If you have already saved the model, it will be saved under the same name. if it is a new file, you will need to enter a name and a disk space.</seg>
<seg id="1118">Restores the scene in the last saved version. all changes since the last storage are discarded.</seg>
<seg id="1119">This menu entry allows you to select only if you still have unsaved changes in the scene.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Repeat the last reversed command. this menu entry allows you to select only if you have used editing.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Stores the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or overwrite an existing arrangement.</seg>
<seg id="1122">In this menu you will find options for setting & kpovmodeling; here you can change the look, keyboard shortcuts and default behavior.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Opens a dialog to change the keyboard shortcut. you can change or add new commands introduced with this option for & kpovmodeler; change commands or add new ones.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Opens a dialog to set up the toolbar. with this option, you can add and remove tool symbols for & kpovmodeler;</seg>
<seg id="1125">A bump map is a way to design rough surfaces without having to model each bump on the surface individually and without changing the geometrical shape of the object itself.</seg>
<seg id="1126">It is common to use the same file for a bump map as well as for a texture map.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Basic bodies are simple geometric shapes that you can use as building blocks: very complex 3D models are created from dozens or even hundreds of these basic parts. these models are then processed to give them a more realistic appearance.</seg>
<seg id="1128">A texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying an image file as color chart.</seg>
<seg id="1129">& kuickshow; is a comfortable image viewer and browser. the application has a file browser in which you can select images to display.</seg>
<seg id="1130">Images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1131">The use of & kuickshow; is very easy. the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the & LMBn; or the Return key.</seg>
<seg id="1132">You can specify whether any image should be displayed in a separate window, or whether all images should always use the same window.</seg>
<seg id="1133">If you are searching for a specific file, simply type the first character of the file name in the browser window. then a small input field appears in the right lower corner. if a suitable file name is found, the file will be highlighted. you can leave the input field by pressing Return or & Esc.</seg>
<seg id="1134">In the dialog Insert - & kuickshow; there are five cards. in three of them, General and Editing and Slideshow, you can set the working method of & kuickshow; in the two others, short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser, the shortcuts can be set for the respective windows.</seg>
<seg id="1135">If this is selected, the images will be opened in full screen mode. if the image is not large enough to fill out the screen, the rest of the display area will be filled with the background color you can set further down. default is not full screen mode.</seg>
<seg id="1136">If this point is activated, loads & kuickshow; already the next image in the folder while you are still looking at the current picture. this reduces the delay if you choose the next image, and is especially suitable for a slide show.</seg>
<seg id="1137">With this option stores & kuickshow; when moving the name of the last opened folder. at the next start & kuickshow; this folder in the browser window.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Click on the colored bar to select a background color. this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode. if the window is larger than the image in the window mode, the background will be filled with the selected color.</seg>
<seg id="1139">You can & kuickshow; set up just some of the file types that the program can also display.</seg>
<seg id="1140">This option increases the display window to the full screen for large images. this option is turned on as default.</seg>
<seg id="1141">Specify if the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image.</seg>
<seg id="1142">The time span between the image change in a slide show. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. default is 3 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="1143">The number of repetitions. if this value is set to 0, the slide show will be repeated until it is aborted by the user. to change the value, you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right next to the input field. default is 1.</seg>
<seg id="1144">Change the shortcuts for the different operating modes of & kuickshow here; in the box cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser.</seg>
<seg id="1145">This option enables you to switch between two-part view of the file system (a window for the subfolders and a window for the files) and one-part view of the file system with folders and files in a window.</seg>

<seg id="1182">You may set existing multimedia keys in such a way that they function as & Amarok; short commands. this allows you to make your keyboard to the & Amarok; Control Centre.</seg>
<seg id="1183">The DCOP interface of Amarok has many general functions, which are mostly found in other KDE programs. this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the DCOP functions of collection, context-browser, player, playlist, playlist browsers and scripts.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Amarok supports the command line options of Qt and & kde; in addition, Amarok has some command-line options.</seg>
<seg id="1185">You should give the user feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a missing dependency. please check in your script to see if all required modules are available and use kdialog to help the user know why a script does not run.</seg>
<seg id="1186">Begin require 'Korundum' Rescue LoadError error = 'Korundum (KDE bindings for ruby) from kdebindings v3.4 is required for this script.' 'kdialog --sorry' # {error} '' exit end</seg>
<seg id="1187">In the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages. you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply expand them to the required functions. you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Using DCOP, your scripts can exchange data with Amarok and control Amarok. the easiest way is to use the dcop command, which should be included in any KDE installation.</seg>
<seg id="1189">Most scripting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands. for this purpose, the function exec () is usually used. in this way, dcop &gt; can be called relatively easily. here is an example in Python:</seg>
<seg id="1190">& Amarok; sends notifications to all running scripts. for this reason, strings are written to the standard input of the script. for this reason, scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events. of course, a script can ignore events even if it has no use for it.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Configure the script to display the setup dialog. to save and store the setup data each script must take care of itself. when a script is started, Amarok will put the working folder on the folder where all data should be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1192">TrackChange: trackChange shows that a new piece is played. the script could now be retrieved with DCOP functions for more information about the new piece (for example, the metadata or the length of the piece).</seg>
<seg id="1193">VolumeChange newvolume Signalizes a change in volume. the new volume is an integer value between 0 and 100.</seg>
<seg id="1194">CustomMenuClicked: submenu itemTitle adds the path to the selected files of the playlist, when a custom menu entry is clicked. to add an entry you can use the DCOP function dcop Amarok script addCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle). to remove an entry you can use dcop Amarok script removeCustomMenuItem (submenu itemTitle).</seg>
<seg id="1195">Before & Amarok; terminates, or when the user stops a script, sends & Amarok; the SIGTERM signal to the script. this signal should be processed to perform cleaning operations, such as storing data or configuration settings.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Amaroks script administration can also install script packages which the user has downloaded from a web server. such packages are basically normal Tar archives (.tar), which can optionally also be compressed with bzip2 (.bz2). we recommend an archive name such as e.g. meinscript.amarokscript.tar.bz2, so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as Amarok script package.</seg>
<seg id="1197">& Amarok; 1.3 will accept only script packages with the exhaustion amaroscript. for this reason, you should name your script packages right away.</seg>
<seg id="1198">The main script must be executable (+ x), the remaining modules to be loaded should not be executable. use the Tar parameter -p to get the file permissions:</seg>
<seg id="1199">If your script package is ready, you can upload it to www.kde-apps.org and attach the link to the wiki scripts page of & Amarok; for your entry on kde-apps you should use the category Amarok; scripts.</seg>

<seg id="1242">& Amarok; is an audio player for Unix systems (like & zb; Linux). for more information, see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screenshots.</seg>
<seg id="1243">Amarok only needs the package kdelibs and no other KDE packages. you have to have kdelibs installed (including the programs included, because & Amarok; takes some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts). we have written a small guide how to compile kdelibs minimally.</seg>
<seg id="1244">Some functions such as the OSD require that your window manager keeps the relevant standards from freedesktop.org. Gnome will work, for example, but fluxbox will work hard. we try to support Amarok on all platforms, so we use kdelibs and Qt, because they provide an excellent development environment.</seg>
<seg id="1245">Probably one of your files will cause an error in the TagLib library for days. you can locate the file by looking at ~ / .kde / share / apps / Amarok / collection _ scan.log.</seg>
<seg id="1246">It is mostly because Taglib crashes when reading the meta information from this file. please report this error to the TagLib developers under bugs.kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="1247">If you use MySQL as a database, try SQLite. support for it in & Amarok; is a bit more mature.</seg>
<seg id="1248">Make sure that all of & Amarok; used libraries have been compiled with the same compiler version. if e.g. & Amarok; with GCC 3.4, TagLib but with GCC 3.3.x was compiled, then this leads to crashes when editing the meta information.</seg>
<seg id="1249">If you use KDE with artsd then deactivate automatically. switch off if inactive for... in setting the sound system, or at least do not use a value of 1 second.</seg>
<seg id="1250">You can also send us the backtrace via e-mail (the e-mail will open automatically in case of a crash). if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good backtrace, the error will be corrected.</seg>
<seg id="1251">This is because many programs write data as UTF-8 into the meta-Infos, but do not mark it as Unicode. the following Perl script resolves the problem.</seg>

<seg id="1272">If you are using the GStreamer driver with the Alsa Sink, the device must provide a mixer. a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously generate audio. this can be achieved by using a sound card with hardware mixer (e.g. SBLive) or by the dmix module for Alsa (Software mixer).</seg>
<seg id="1273">The output of this command should help you in finding the cause and a solution. for GStreamer, you may need to specify a different sink (e.g. ossesink).</seg>
<seg id="1274">You can't just send an MP3 to ALSA, you would just listen to a white noise. GStreamer is the best choice for most people if you're looking for a decoder with little overhead. GStreamer reads the file, decodes it and sends the PCM data to ALSA. just like XMMS.</seg>

<seg id="1333">& Amarok; is a multi-sided multimedia player. it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control. as any normal multimedia player has also & Amarok; a player window with the most important functions. additionally, & Amarok; however, a playlist that is superior to all others.</seg>
<seg id="1334">In this chapter, it explains how all the functions of & Amarok; used, including creating a collection and a playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1335">The player window is your one-click & Amarok; Control Center. at the top of the window is a scroll display showing the current piece or current stream. just below it is the range, the game time, bit rate and sample rate of the current piece. one click on this area changes the display of the already expired season to the remaining game time of the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1336">In addition, the player window includes a selection of audio analyzers, even under the scroll display. you can change through the available Analyzer by clicking with the left mouse button on the area.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The & Amarok; Analyzer can be separated from the player window. press d on your keyboard and the current analyzer is displayed in an independent, extensible window.</seg>
<seg id="1338">The PL and EQ buttons are also included under the balance sheet. the PL button activates or deactivates the playlists window, while the EQ button is used to set equalizers.</seg>
<seg id="1339">The rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons, the volume control and the play position slider. use the sliders to set the piece position or volume. with the playback buttons, you can start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece.</seg>
<seg id="1340">The use of the built-in equalizer is simple and works with all audio drivers. there are 17 presets, from classic to techno, and you can easily create your own preferences.</seg>
<seg id="1341">To view the Equalizer, use Extras Equalizer from the main menu or click the EQ button in the player window. once you select the check box Equalizer, the equalizer is in operation.</seg>
<seg id="1342">The Playlist of & Amarok; is the most advanced playlist for all & kde; available multimedia players. it has many features that there is no other player. but don't let the abundance of functions deter you, they are all easy to use.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The playlists window can be divided into two main areas, on the left hand side of the navigation pane. in the navigation pane, you will find some of the excellent functions of the playlist, such as the context browser. on the right is the playlist itself. the playlist is easy to use and even for advanced users powerful enough.</seg>
<seg id="1344">The context-browser shows different information regarding the current piece. its appearance can be adapted using context-browser designs. the context-browser contains three sub-windows: music, text and interpreter. these three subwindows will later be explained in detail.</seg>
<seg id="1345">If you have already used earlier versions of & Amarok; you might notice that the sub-window has dropped off. the information displayed there has now been distributed to other parts of & Amarok. in addition, the information can be viewed in the statistics window (Extras statistics).</seg>
<seg id="1346">The music sub-window displays information about the currently running track, as well as the interpreter and the album.</seg>
<seg id="1347">The first section in this sub-window displays information about the piece. in the title there is the name of the piece, artist and the album. below you see the cover picture of the album and next to it a MusicBrainz symbol. click on this icon to check the piece in the MusicBrainz database.</seg>
<seg id="1348">You can find more information about the current piece under the MusicBrainz icon. see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation.</seg>
<seg id="1349">To view cover pictures in the context browser, the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece. the file formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif and .png are supported. the context browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1350">The next section, Recommended Pieces, lists several recommended pieces. if you click on one of these pieces, it will play immediately.</seg>
<seg id="1351">Among the recommended pieces are the favourite pieces of this interpreter. this area shows the five highest rated pieces of the current interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1352">You can set which information to display in the music subwindow. to do so, right click anywhere in the sub-window and select from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1353">The last section, albums of the interpreter, lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection. if you click on an album, it will be opened and you will see the content of the album.</seg>
<seg id="1354">You can click all the pieces in the individual areas to start playing immediately. you can also right-click on it and then select one of the options to add the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="1355">In the subwindow, the downloaded text is displayed for the current piece. this function is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using self-written scripts. as soon as you click on the text subwindow, try & Amarok; to download the text for the piece from the internet. if no text script is running, you can choose which to start.</seg>
<seg id="1356">The Edit button allows you to edit the song text. the modified version is then stored in & Amarok; s collection database. no running text script is required.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The Search button opens a search on google.com after the song text for the current piece (in an external browser window).</seg>
<seg id="1358">Group Interpret - grouped only the top level, each piece is displayed directly below the interpreter. albums or genres are ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Grouping Interpret / Album - First the pieces are arranged according to the artist and a further division will be made according to the respective album. if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums, this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Different Artists.</seg>
<seg id="1360">Group Artist / Year - Album - Sorted by Interpret and then after the year of the album in descending order (latest first). if the year is unknown for an album, the default 0 - album name is related.</seg>
<seg id="1361">Grouping album - All albums of your collection are displayed alphabetically by each other. the interpreter is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="1362">Grouping genre / interpreter - your pieces will first be sorted by genre and among them by interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1363">Grouping genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above, but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1364">With the help of the remaining buttons, you can customize and combine grouping at will.</seg>
<seg id="1365">With the last button you can change the settings to the collection. note: & Amarok; will automatically record your collection once you change something to the selected folders. if you own many pieces, this could take a while.</seg>
<seg id="1366">A search filter is located directly under the toolbar. it behaves in the list view as well as in the tree view. instructions for using this filter can be found in the section on the playlist in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1367">Below the search filter is a selection box with which you can filter the recently added pieces to your collection. you can select different time windows, starting from the last 24 hours up to one year. in addition, you can also select your total collection, making the filter practically shut off.</seg>
<seg id="1368">By clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser, you will receive the following possibilities.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Load - This empties the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback.</seg>
<seg id="1370">Attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces to the current playlist. by double-clicking on an entry you will reach the same effect.</seg>
<seg id="1371">Set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue. this will play you next.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Save as a playlist... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist. you will be asked for a name under which the list is to be saved.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Transfer the pieces to the Media Player - Add the pieces to the Media Player. see the Media-Player Browser section for more details.</seg>
<seg id="1374">Burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - thus the selected pieces are sent to K3b and burned either as a data or an audio CD. if K3b is not installed, this option is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Edit metadata (for n pieces)... - Open the dialog for item information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1376">(s) Move files to the garbage bin... - Open a confirmation dialog. if you confirm this, the selected files will be deleted from your computer.</seg>
<seg id="1377">Select as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation, whereupon it appears under different interpreters.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Set up a compilation selection - Modifies an album marked as a compilation back into a normal album. afterwards, the album is no longer displayed under different interpreters, but again under the corresponding interpreter.</seg>
<seg id="1379">The playlists browser makes it easy to deal with many playlists. among other things, it also includes intelligent playlists.</seg>
<seg id="1380">The bottom part of the playlists browser contains the smart playlists. they use & Amarok; s built-in database to automatically create some useful playlists for runtime. the smart playlists are composed of:</seg>
<seg id="1381">Never played: a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Even created smart playlists are possible. click on Add Intelligent playlist to open the dialog for creating a new Smart playlist, where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1383">The Media Player sub-window is used for connection of & Amarok; with your portable media player (e.g. iPod). for example, to use your iPod with & Amarok; in / mnt / ipod. if & Amarok; started, you will find the pieces on your iPod by artist sorted in the upper list view of the media player browser.</seg>
<seg id="1384">To transfer songs to your iPod, drag the required titles from the playlist and drop them to the list Interpret. if you're done, click Apply. this way the pieces will be uploaded to your iPod. if the transfer is finished, finish & Amarok; and loosen the drive engagement for your iPod.</seg>
<seg id="1385">The toolbar contains a search area with which you can search for a file. the search is especially useful in folders with very many files because in the file list all files that do not match your search criteria.</seg>
<seg id="1386">In the lower part of the file browser there is an address bar where you can fetch music from a entered URL. if you enter tar: / home / mike / musi.tar.gz and press Enter, you can access music in the musictar.gz file. now you can drag and drop the music from there to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1387">If the playlist is longer than in the window, the attachment of files can be difficult by simply dropping. in that case, holding down the Shift key can be helpful. by doing so, dropped files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list, and not at the mouse position.</seg>
<seg id="1388">The playlist contains all pieces attached to play. you can change the order by simply drag the entries into the desired location by using the mouse. once you enter letters, only the pieces that contain the letters will be displayed. to reset the filter, press the back button for a long time until the text field is empty again.</seg>
<seg id="1389">If you enter search terms separated by spaces, & Amarok; search for entries that contain all search terms. for example, if you enter one or two, the search will find all entries that contain one, two, and three.</seg>
<seg id="1390">If you enter OR between the search terms OR, search for entries that contain either one or the other search term. for example, one OR two OR three. in this example, all pieces are found that contain one or two or three (or a combination thereof).</seg>
<seg id="1391">If you want to search for entries that contain spaces, then enclose the search term with geese feet: Mike Oldfield. this will search for entries that Mike Oldfield contain, but not for entries such as Mike J. Oldfield.</seg>
<seg id="1392">If you specify a specific search column, you can also search for larger or smaller. for example: evaluation: &gt; 50. this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50.</seg>
<seg id="1393">If you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term, set a minus sign in front of the search term: -something is looking for pieces that do not contain anything.</seg>
<seg id="1394">You can combine these syntax variations with each other at will. example: Mike Oldfield OR score: &gt; 50 -comment: bad. this is looking for all pieces that have either Mike Oldfield or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath.</seg>
<seg id="1395">You can specify the sequence of entries by holding down the Ctrl key, and then click with the right mouse button in the desired order on the entries. entries will then be marked with a number. the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played.</seg>
<seg id="1396">The toolbar of the playlist is located at the bottom of the playlist. it contains buttons for some functions of the playlist. on the left hand side, you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist. to the right of the playlist you will find a playlist, empty playlist and random mixing.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Next, the buttons will follow back and restore. this allows you to revert or restore changes to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In the middle of the toolbar is a unique, magnifying analyzer. the refresh rate can be set with a click of the right mouse button on the Analyzer.</seg>
<seg id="1399">The last button in the toolbar is menu. it opens the same menu as that you get in the player window over the right mouse button. over this menu you can set up & Amarok; 's configuration.</seg>

<seg id="1401">The status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist. it shows the title of the current piece, the number of pieces and the total play time of all pieces. furthermore, the status for random mode and retrieval is displayed by clicking twice in the appropriate display area with the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1402">You can also hide the status bar. to do so, disable the status bar option in the General Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1403">The context menu can be reached by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window, or by clicking on the playlist in the playlist. through this menu you can reach the settings of & Amarok;</seg>

<seg id="1453">Normalize: this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level. this can, for example, be useful for creating mixed CD's and Mp3 collections; without normalize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently loudly.</seg>
<seg id="1454">EMovix: this is a very small Linux distribution. it contains the necessary software to be able to start from CD and automatically play all videos in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1455">This is a convenient way to recharge recently opened projects. the associated submenu contains a list of these projects. one click on an entry opens the project.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Save the current project. if the project has been saved already, the previously created file will be overwritten, otherwise it will be asked for a new file name.</seg>
<seg id="1457">Save the current project under a new file name. KDE's dialog Save is displayed with which you can choose folders and file name for the project file.</seg>
<seg id="1458">Stores all opened projects. this is the same as if you would call for each project file saving.</seg>
<seg id="1459">Closes the current project. if a project has been modified and not yet saved, ask & k3b; after what has to happen. you can then choose to discard between saving and changes. you can also cancel the closing and keep the project so open.</seg>
<seg id="1460">Closes all opened projects. & k3b; will ask for any unsaved project what to do with it, just as if you would have called for each project file.</seg>
<seg id="1461">Closes all opened projects and ends & k3b; for each not saved project will be asked what to do with it, as if you would have called file closing.</seg>
<seg id="1462">When you call this entry, you can select files to add to the project using the appearing dialog. this has the same effect as if you view the files directly from the top view into the project view. if the current project is a data CD, the added files will appear in the base folder of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1463">Open the dialog "Burn" for the current project. this dialog is basically the same as the Properties dialog of the project. the only difference is the additional button Burn, the & k3b; to burn the medium. the burning dialog can only be opened when the project already contains data.</seg>
<seg id="1464">Opens the Properties dialog for the current project. here you can make many project-related settings. each project type has different possible settings, most of which are described by the What is the? -help (accessible via the right mouse button).</seg>
<seg id="1465">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. it causes & k3b; files from a previous session to import into the current project. this is useful if you do not use files for a multi-session CD. the data of the previous session are always included, even if this function is not used. it is intended for you rather than help, so that you can see the files and folders already existing on the medium.</seg>
<seg id="1466">This entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project. this feature causes & k3b; to remove imported files from the current project. all other files remain in the project. this function does not remove files from the medium, it only blends the previously imported files.</seg>
<seg id="1467">This allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also create a copy of a CD which you can burn later. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. you should also prefer cloning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs.</seg>
<seg id="1468">This allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file. alternatively, you can also only create a copy of a DVD, which you can burn later on. also, there is also the possibility of cloning instead of normal copying. therefore, the target medium must be large enough to record the entire (video) data of the source medium in the original form.</seg>
<seg id="1469">Opens the dialog to delete a CD-RW, so you can delete the whole content or parts of a CD-RW.</seg>
<seg id="1470">Opens the dialog for formatting a DVD. with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R (W), allowing the content to be completely deleted. & k3b; lets you choose between the writing modes and incremental.</seg>
<seg id="1471">The dialog will prompt you for a * .iso, * .cue or * .toc file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button. (Neros * .nrg files are currently not supported, but you have to use other tools such as Nrg2Iso.)</seg>
<seg id="1472">Burn a previously created DVD image. the dialog will ask you for a * .iso file as a data source, which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button.</seg>
<seg id="1473">A previously loaded DVD video can be converted. this dialog box will typically help you to read a DVD in the table view, but can also be used alone. it contains information about the selected video, encoding settings, and even ways to change the size and cut off black edges.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Displays information about the inserted medium. this information is displayed in the table of contents and contains properties of the medium such as size and title length of the CD or DVD.</seg>
<seg id="1475">Displays a list of toolbar of & k3b; if an entry is selected, the toolbar is currently visible in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1476">If this is crossed, a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window. it contains information about the status of & k3b; and its activities. if this is not enabled, the status bar is hidden.</seg>
<seg id="1477">The folder view contains an overview of your folders and the CD / DVD drives. if the contents view is enabled, their contents will be shown in the contents view. CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info, locks and unlock the drive or ejecting the media.</seg>
<seg id="1478">The Content View allows selecting and dragging files into the project view. the table of contents is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs, if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view.</seg>
<seg id="1479">The head bar is a narrow area which is only visible when the project view contains open projects. the head bar has no real function, it only looks nice and separates the project view from the rest of the views.</seg>
<seg id="1480">This opens a dialog box for changing the keyboard shortcuts for & k3b; after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part, you can customize the key assignment below.</seg>
<seg id="1481">This will start the k3b; Setup Wizard. thus, the correct permissions can be set to burn CDs and DVDs. for this, system administrator rights are required, so you must enter the password for the system administrator (root) when you start the wizard.</seg>
<seg id="1482">Opens the settings of & k3b; here general program settings can be made. almost all functions of & k3b; should work at first. this dialog is intended for personalization and fine adjustment of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1483">& k3b; is, like many other & kde; -applications also equipped with a & DCOP; interface. with the help of this interface, parts of functionality can be controlled, for example, by a shell script.</seg>
<seg id="1484">To use the dCOP & DCOP functions, you can either use the dcop command line program or the slightly more convenient program Kdcop. both programs are identical in the range of functions, so your taste and type of task is crucial, which of the enclosed programs you give preference.</seg>
<seg id="1485">In this chapter we assume that you use the command line program dcop. to use the & DCOP functions, you must first make sure that & k3b; started. then enter something like the following at the console:</seg>
<seg id="1486">In addition to the general & DCOP; functions that have common all & kde; program commonly supported, & k3b; mainly two more parts described below.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The standard DCOP interface of & k3b; provides features such as copyCD, format DVD and other functions for creating new projects.</seg>
<seg id="1488">DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoCDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createVideoDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () DCOPRef createDataDVDProject () void dupDvd () void burnCdImage () void BurnDvdImage () void BurnDvdImage (KURL url)</seg>
<seg id="1489">As a result of such a createXXXProject method you get a DCOP reference to the newly created project: DCOPRef (k3b, K3bProject-0) Alternatively you can create a project using the command line: # k3b --audiocd and then receive a reference to the project via # dcop k3b K3bInterface currentProject.</seg>
<seg id="1490">K3b offers the listed K3bProjectinterface and the powerful K3bDataProjectinterface, which is only applicable to data projects (CD and DVD):</seg>
<seg id="1491">Void createFolder (QString name) void createFolder (QString name, Qstring parent) void addUrls (Qstring path) void renameItem (QString path) void renameItem (QString path, QString Newname) void setVolumeID (QString id)</seg>
<seg id="1492">Thus it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script. for example, the following script creates a data project, multiple folders and then add files to the new folder:</seg>
<seg id="1493">#! / bin / bash PROJECT = $(dcop k3b K3bInterface createDataCDProject) dcop $PROJECT createFolder foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder bar / foo dcop $PROJECT createFolder</seg>
<seg id="1494">& kaudio Creator; is an audio CD; selector for & kde; with it you can easily record audio CD; s out and stored in MP3- or OGG files. also other formats are possible depending on encoder installed on the computer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">& kaudio Creator; is the user interface of cdparanoia (for reading & CD; data in wav files on hard disk) and by many coding files that encoded these WAV files. currently, lame for MP3, oggenc for OGGs and FLAC (lossless compression) are currently supported. more encoders may be added to the program (if they have been installed).</seg>
<seg id="1496">First the titles of the & CD; read out and stored in wav files on the computer (lossless and compressed); and then</seg>
<seg id="1497">In a second step these WAV files (usually one per title) are compressed into the mp3 or OGG format or also in other formats such as lossless FLAC.</seg>
<seg id="1498">For the first step, reading the & CD;, it is used by & kaudio creator; cdparanoia. almost every distribution has compiled a pre-compiled package; if this is not yet installed, this has to be done now.</seg>
<seg id="1499">For the second step lame (for MP3), oggable (for OGG) or other encoders must be installed. all these programs are usually not necessary for any Linux distributions, so it is probably not necessary to compile anything yourself. however, if not used, for example, FLAC is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1500">Which encoding / file format is to be used? chapter Welcher Kodierer is a small introduction about encoders, audio quality and compression factors.</seg>
<seg id="1501">A word to copy protected audio CD; s: as already said, used & kaudio creator; cdparanoia for reading audio data from the & CD; this program is not intended to prevent any copy protection. if not the firmware of the & CD; / DVD device circumvents the protection, it is not possible to read the mechanisms of copy protection. just avoid buying copy-protected audio CD; s!</seg>
<seg id="1502">While setting up only needs to be done once (the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration is found), the daily handling for reading a & CD; explained on the hard disk. this leads (hopefully) to understand the slim approach of the user interface, which you will often stumble at the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="1503">Convert into many formats - depending on which encoding programs are installed (MP3, OGG, FLAC & etc;)</seg>
<seg id="1504">Can & CD; fetch information from the freedb from the Internet or can work completely without a network, where everything is recorded manually.</seg>
<seg id="1505">This is just a short list of the commands of the main window. on the page step by step example, you will find more information about how this program is used and screen shots with descriptions of the tabs for configuration of the program.</seg>
<seg id="1506">Starts the CDDB request of the CD data according to the setup of request in the CDDB tab. (this may be local or online, in the latter case first the connection to the Internet must be established.)</seg>
<seg id="1507">Starts reading and - if a encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup directory - the encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1508">Opens a sub-menu with a list of available encoders, so the selection with a different encoder can be read as the standard. it should be noted that previously the encoder has been configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Opens the File Manager, allowing an already selected file to be selected instead of a full & CD; read and encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1510">Opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification (such as protocols, spades) for program events (such as reading the & CD; terminating).</seg>
<seg id="1511">Opens the main setup dialog of & kaudio creator; with different card cards (such as encoder, for setting the encoder). here you have to go before the program can be successfully used!</seg>
<seg id="1512">This chapter describes sound quality, encoders and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding.</seg>
<seg id="1513">If no audio information is to be lost, a lossless audio format is required. besides FLAC, there are also other such as' shorten 'or' monkey 'that may be available for this distribution. the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files.</seg>
<seg id="1514">The audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psychoacoustical model are MP3 and OGG. OGG today may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower bitrates (up to 128 kbps), but the differences are less important because both encoders generate very good audio quality.</seg>
<seg id="1515">O'not so 'free, lame is nevertheless supplied with most distributions for free, but there are open license questions</seg>
<seg id="1516">+ high to very high sound quality (with high bit rates), but compared to OGG slightly lower quality with deeper bit rates.</seg>
<seg id="1517">OGG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few OGG backups is present.</seg>
<seg id="1518">MP3 - if music should also be heard on other devices, such as standard DVD players, portable devices (USB stick, memory card, hard drive) or special car stereo systems. today - at the beginning of 2009 - these devices mostly support only MP3 format.</seg>
<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">'--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice.</seg>
<seg id="1523">'--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. requires always 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1524">'-h '= 128 kbps CBR Joint stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good enough for music of youths, portable devices and autostereoanlagen. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems.</seg>
<seg id="1525">'--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be excessive for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting.</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is entered manually or retrieved by the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudio creator; and the encoding program to generate the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">In connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the coding explain the switches for these programs.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the CD; add title to the keywords (English: day) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt must be added by lame and the title Parameters of & kaudio Creator; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudio creator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">This is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs, which can download information instead of entering the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, Artist, Names of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) I am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; there is no more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be hurt. all information can be obtained anyway at a stroll through a & CD; business, physical or virtual.</seg>
<seg id="1532">In & kaudio creator; is active to select a check box (sending an address). for the use of freedb can be used with another (fake) address as the one in the system. in this type of configuration, it seems that the email address is not used by the server (This may only know the programmer who checked the code.)</seg>
<seg id="1533">There are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudio creator; to use freedb, geographically the closest mirrored server should be used. this saves bandwidth in the network and balances the load between the hosts.</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively, the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the CD; to save in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">There are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who you want to know more accurately, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see Note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed, if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="1537">To save the read files read, the encoders and thus the desired file format can be selected. the first opening contains predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a lossless compression for audio data) on the encoding tab. other encoders can be added on this tab.</seg>
<seg id="1538">The encoder package must be installed by the Linux distribution in question before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined codes. more information about encoders can be found in the section Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a encoder, further information about its switches can be obtained by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder.</seg>
<seg id="1540">This can have many causes. check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD disk, the writing and reading rights on it and whether both cdparanoia and the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) are installed.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want a copy-protected audio CD; check out the shell of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">There is one chapter with one step by step example. even if you are using other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed.</seg>
<seg id="1543">Have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want.</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 headwords (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">You need to have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine as it is considered not entirely free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists and that you have write permission to copy it (eg by trying to copy something inside it).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting up of & kaudio creator; something that will probably only be done once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes how to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each read-out & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the code used to compression music (lame) and audio format (MP3) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). as we are lazy, we share the program to use the freedb to download data from the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">Although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it at any read-out of a & CD; change once the appropriate settings are found.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name will be handed over to the reading program to read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Often / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your drive. if this does not work or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is present, a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device names for CD-ROM and / or DVD drives helps.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The tab General Settings. here is not much to do here. here an additional conversion can be defined. in our example everything is left / entered as shown in the screenshot.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Only select queries in case of incomplete information so that you will be informed when information on the creation of keywords (tags) is missing.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Simply select both entries. we are comfortable and allow the & CD; data can be automatically downloaded via the internet from a freedb calculator.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Note: the computer must be connected to the Internet while reading the & CD, so that it can access the freedb server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">The second drop-down box is easier, a & CD; entry found starts immediately reading the & CD; this is associated with low risk if you are later unsatisfied with the database entry and the directory name / filename resulting from it, and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; tagger.</seg>
<seg id="1558">Apart from this example, keep in mind: if you want to manually enter everything manually, deactivate the selection fields and freedb will not be used. however, if you download the database beforehand. however, if you want to use freedb in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first one.</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is freedb for us. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freedb server over the Internet. how does the system know which data to get the CD? read the section on freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1560">Mode: we did not download the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server.</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB-Server: please go to the freedb.org site and look for a mirror server near you. on this way, the load is distributed between the hosts. however, this setting will work as the first attempt.</seg>
<seg id="1562">Both work equivalent to the server, since many firewalls bounce the protocol 8880 by default, there might be more luck with the protocol 80, since the HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1563">In this example we do not want any & CD; send data to the freedb server. disable the first check box.</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings from the screen shot. (make sure that the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">Number of simultaneously discharging pieces: sorry, there is one reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author doesn't know, therefore simply try himself.</seg>
<seg id="1566">CD; discard after reading the last piece: check this for the & CD; discard it at the end of the process.</seg>
<seg id="1567">User-defined folder for temporary files: if you tick this, then / must be specified the path / folder where the WAV files are stored. if the field is not checked, the files will be created in the private folder. do not forget this folder if you want to do something yourself with the WAV files.</seg>
<seg id="1568">Enter everything as it is on the screen shot. the command is a bit long, under certain circumstances something must be flattened to the right to see everything.</seg>
<seg id="1569">'--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as mentioned earlier, this is sufficient for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo systems. the resulting bit rate is about 224 to 256 kpbs. this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption.</seg>
<seg id="1570">Note the entry '--id3v1-only' for restricting the creation of tags to version V1 / V1.1. 'ID3v2' tags may also be deleted if required. Kid3 is an excellent 'id3' tagger for & kde; in case of a later change of tags.% f and% o are internal variables for the name of the input file (including the complete path) and output file (including the complete path).</seg>
<seg id="1571">Set the rest as in the screenshot. some comments for future use outside this example:</seg>
<seg id="1572">Number of simultaneously encoded WAV files: with a Dualcore or Quad Core or even a multiprocessor machine can be tried to encode more than one WAV file at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">That's it, we just finished the basic setup of & kaudio creator; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a & CD; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wisely, you never need to change it again.</seg>
<seg id="1574">In this section it describes how the process of reading the & CD; runs on the hard disk. we will create MP3 files. the folder structure, the way the music on the hard disk is organized, was described in the previous section. first, a connection to the Internet is built, since we are comfortable and the & CD; data from the freedb.</seg>
<seg id="1575">Since we use a CD, which is not yet contained in freedb, the screenshots look a little different from the data obtained for a & CD; therefore, you will learn the & CD; to manually enter data instead of extracting it from the Internet. comments will point to the differences.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Do not try the & CD; this example can be found. it is a 'special' edition of the author of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="1577">If this has not happened yet, then the & CD must now be pushed into the drive defined in the main window.</seg>
<seg id="1578">After a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screenshot. this is only when the & CD; as an audio CD; can be identified and can be read by cdparanoia.</seg>
<seg id="1579">If this does not happen, then search in the Questions and Answers section after the Help or go back to the previous section on basic settings.</seg>
<seg id="1580">Attention: if the & CD; successfully picked up by the freedb, all tracks are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1581">In the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the 'unique' & CD; there is a window displayed and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your & CD; matches.</seg>
<seg id="1582">If you have not selected the check box for the automatic query of freedb (on the page & CD; settings in dialog for the settings), you can also trigger it manually by selecting the first button on the toolbar. if you don't have a local database, but fetch the data from the Internet, you need the connection to the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1583">E 1.2 Step 02: the CD Editor - Input of the CD data and the title of the first piece</seg>
<seg id="1584">Enter the data for your & CD; according to the pattern on the next screen shot. the title of the piece in the first row of the text 'current title', the rest of the data in the input field 'Album'.</seg>
<seg id="1585">The artist no longer needs to be entered in the "current title" input field unless you have a collection of different artists for each piece.</seg>
<seg id="1586">The lower comment field can be used for individual comments of the individual comments per piece, the commentary box of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD.</seg>
<seg id="1587">Attention: after the successful retrieval of the data from the freedb the CD editor is not empty, but it already contains the data as shown in the screenshot. however, it is always a good idea to check the contents of the CD editor so that you can not only start with the artist and album name (e.g. whether all words start with capital letters or not...), but also to check if there are any unwanted comments.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Note: in this example, we only use ID3v1 tags. this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist, album and title of a piece and on only 28 characters for the commentary box. if you use ID3v2 tags, you have unlimited field length, at least on what & kaudio creator; this option is set on the encoding settings tab.</seg>
<seg id="1589">You can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using the tag editor. Kid3 is a good tool for MP3 files, with it you can also create ID3v2 tags.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Tags are not supported by all encoders and file formats. see Help for the encoder to get more information.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Simply select an entry that is obviously compatible with the style of the downloadable CD; in this example, this is not important because we do not transmit the CD; for more information go to the website of freedb.org and read the information about the categories. pop or Rap for example are found under Rock.</seg>
<seg id="1592">After choosing 'OK' you come back to the main window. just click on the line with the second piece.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The window of the CD editor appears again and you see that the fields for the album are already filled with the input data we have recorded for the first piece. simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece. the title of the piece in any case and any other information you wish.</seg>
<seg id="1594">Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the & CD; entered.</seg>
<seg id="1595">Attention: this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the freedb. it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1596">It is the third button of the toolbar. note that the artist and the album are displayed above the parts list.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece. only the titles that are so marked are read out. a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece, or press the All items selected at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Was started by clicking on the selection process read out the read process, then this window will appear for confirmation. click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what happens.</seg>
<seg id="1599">Click on the tab assignments to switch to the job window. it is in the left upper half of the window, right under the buttons of the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1600">This is the window to check the orders. the first piece is read just on the hard drive. the status of the program is shown in the left lower part of the window in the status line.</seg>
<seg id="1601">You will see this error message if you try to work with a code that you have not yet installed. pieces that have not been successfully decoded are marked with a red 'X' in the order list.</seg>
<seg id="1602">By the way, the folder for the TMP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example. have you checked if you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder?; -)</seg>
<seg id="1603">Now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece.</seg>
<seg id="1604">The assignment 1 reads the first piece, it is finished. but we have a new entry: assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3. thus, read and encoding in parallel. note the status message in the lower part of the window, it is now improved.</seg>
<seg id="1605">The author of the program has not found a configuration setting to suppress this behavior. the only thing that seems configurable is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding. in case of weak machines, the result is unclear. the computer with an AMD64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous interpretation and encoding (from however two different pieces).</seg>
<seg id="1606">Now the last title is read out, while another piece is encoded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding. after the last piece is encoded, a small window with a message for a short time is displayed in the upper left part of the window.</seg>
<seg id="1607">For the successful use of & kaudio creator;, you need & kde; 3.x. or 4.x and cdparanoia. if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG, you need the encoder of your choice.</seg>
<seg id="1608">If you are familiar with CVS, you can download an anonymous copy from there. most distributions, however, already contain a pre-compiled package, as & kaudio creator; a part of an important bundle. if you read this, you probably already did...</seg>
<seg id="1609">This section is directed to persons compiled from source files and not intended for users who use a pre-compiled package of their distribution.</seg>
<seg id="1610">If you are looking for help how the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running, then the following is right for you:</seg>
<seg id="1611">A program that calls many different programs has many different settings. it is best to read the step by step example to get to know the options and settings. it shows screenshots of the different map cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example.</seg>
<seg id="1612">Hello, still read on? even if only the help menu was clicked after the first time of the program, without any clue how to proceed from this somehow empty screen (especially if there is no audio CD at the time of the program starts), or from the unusually short menu?</seg>
<seg id="1613">What is it about? who reads this has probably already started the program. it should look something like this:</seg>
<seg id="1614">A bad example: unfortunately no e-mail. the author cannot maintain this manual. it is intended as the first version for a manual to & kaudio creator; may it do. at least after contact with the author. and if you read this, he has left this section and is therefore agreeing to this suggestion.</seg>

<seg id="1616">& kmid; is the MIDI- and Karaoke player of & kde; in addition to others, it also has some features with real-time graphics and karaoke live upliftment of texts that other & UNIX; -MIDI players do not have.</seg>
<seg id="1617">& kmid; runs under & Linux; and FreeBSD. it builds on the OSS system, so should work on all systems with OSS and & kmid; also supports the & Linux; Ultrasound project driver, which is needed for GUS cards. Alsa is included as soon as it supports a sequencer.</seg>
<seg id="1618">& kmid; shows the lyrics on the screen with changing color, so it's easy to follow the piece.</seg>
<seg id="1619">Graphical representation of the activity of any MIDI channel by highlighting the pressed keys on the (virtual) keyboard.</seg>
<seg id="1620">Drag & drop so that you can drag in & drop; any MIDI file from one & konqueror; -windows can drag to kmid.</seg>
<seg id="1621">Supports both existing standards in order to save text into MIDI files (real estate events or text events). kmid automatically determines the method used.</seg>
<seg id="1622">Session support. when you finish & kde while playing a song, kmid will start with the same song next time.</seg>
<seg id="1623">Supports external MIDI synthesizers, AWE, FM and GUS cards (for the latter you need the LUP driver and gusd).</seg>
<seg id="1624">First, you can select Open... from the File menu. it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1625">You can also drop a file from a & konqueror; -Window to the & kmid; Window. this also works with multiple songs at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1626">To play a piece of music, open it and press the button playback in the toolbar, select the entry Cancel from the menu item or press the space bar.</seg>
<seg id="1627">Please note that & kmid; a piece will automatically start as soon as you move it to the & kmid; (with several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one after the other.)</seg>
<seg id="1628">Once & kmid; play a piece, you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller.</seg>
<seg id="1629">If you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly, you can click on the arrows left and right of the tempo display and change the playback speed. in order to get the original tempo, double-click on the Tempo- LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1630">The space bar has two tasks: when a piece is played, a pressure on the space bar acts like a pressure on the pause button or the selection of the menu entry pause in the menu piece, thus interrupts playback. pressing the space bar while no play is played, starts & kmid; playback.</seg>
<seg id="1631">Lyrics can be saved in two ways in a piece of music. some pieces use text event, others use lyrics, and others both. some pieces don't have any lyrics at all: -)</seg>
<seg id="1632">In & kmid, you can set what events are to be displayed and even better: the type of event will be automatically determined, which a song uses, so that you do not need to manually adjust it. so if you activate the Auto Text option in the Settings menu, the karaoke text will be automatically selected.</seg>
<seg id="1633">If you want to set an event type, select the entries in the Settings menu from the Settings menu. the same function has the keys 1 and 2.</seg>
<seg id="1634">A collection is a list of MIDI files that you can summarize. these are played back in series. in this section you can see how you can use collections efficiently.</seg>
<seg id="1635">To create a collection, first open the collection manager. you will find this in the menu item under the item Organize.... click New and enter the name for the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1636">You can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specifying the name for the new collection. this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original collection.</seg>
<seg id="1637">If you have more than one collection, you can set the respective prizes in the collection manager.</seg>
<seg id="1638">The temporary collection contains all the songs you want to add to any other collection.</seg>
<seg id="1639">When leaving the application, this collection will not be saved. remember that if you add a lot of pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1640">To add songs to a collection, it has to be selected in the collection manager. there you can add a song with the Add a song. it again appears the file dialog with which you can select the song you want.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A second method to add a song depends on setting Automatic Addition to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1642">When automatic addition to the collection is enabled, a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening (using File Open or Drag & Drop).</seg>
<seg id="1643">If automatic add to the collection is not checked, the temporary collection will be activated and emptied when opening a piece. this collection will then be added to the pieces opened.</seg>
<seg id="1644">To remove a song from a collection, you need to open the collection manager, select the collection and the desired song and then click Remove.</seg>
<seg id="1645">You can select the order in which the songs are played. if you select the sequence from the submenu of the menu item, the songs will play in the order as they were added to the collection.</seg>
<seg id="1646">If you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu, the order will be redefined.</seg>
<seg id="1647">To play a song, select it from the collection manager, or use the selection list above the karaoke text.</seg>
<seg id="1648">To skip a song, select the Next Song button, the post next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right.</seg>
<seg id="1649">To jump vice versa a song, select the Preferences button, previous item from the menu item or press the arrow on the left.</seg>
<seg id="1650">To delete a collection, open the collection manager, select the collection to be deleted and click the Delete button.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The temporary collection cannot be deleted. however, this does not matter, since it is not stored when leaving & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1652">This is absolutely necessary for synthesizers who are not General MIDI capable. in this case, the MIDI-map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands.</seg>
<seg id="1653">For example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all the events of the type Change patch to Bright Piano into events of the type Change patch to Trumpet and lets you sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play.</seg>
<seg id="1654">If you have just one sound card, you don't need MIDI-map because all sound cards GM -compatible (incl. Awe - and GUS charts, FM devices and so on).</seg>
<seg id="1655">Unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file from your hand (using your favorite editor).</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI map is a text file that stores all the necessary translations for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">Each section may appear only once, except the keymap section, which may appear as often as desired. however, a prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below).</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of Keymap..." END Define keymap "Another Keymap..." END Define Keymap... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">You see that Define is needed to indicate that a section will start (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail, so that I can offer support for devices that are not General MIDI compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. general usage is as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">Please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The optional AllkeysTo M is used to set all sounds that this instrument requires to play on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60) which sounds similar to a gun.</seg>
<seg id="1664">So if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to represent another percussion instrument (drums, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum (as some keyboards possess).</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how tones are shown on a particular channel or instrument.</seg>
<seg id="1667">As with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries.</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keywords for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Key maps are used above all to map tones to the percussion channel. take a look at the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and second channel, just do it in the CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">However, these settings are more useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9).</seg>
<seg id="1672">MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:</seg>
<seg id="1673">N is the channel, which is displayed on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the Keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored which will try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is always used.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a pitch-naming event with the value n, it is converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used to prevent decimal commas in the map file.</seg>
<seg id="1676">This setting is needed because GM pretends that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, is supposed to play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you must try a bit with & kmid; try it.</seg>
<seg id="1677">To use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find this in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings.</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a full range of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">You can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view (until now) has two different views to display the played notes. in the Settings menu, select Settings from the point channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">The speed LCD indicates the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed.</seg>
<seg id="1682">So, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows left and right from the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1683">A MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; thus, the same MIDI file can lead to very different results on two different devices, just like two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed and etc; you have control over everything.</seg>
<seg id="1685">This can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) of & kmid; this happens because & kmid; compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)</seg>
<seg id="1686">I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files separately.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Agree to support & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder that you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files and drag them to & kmid; Window.</seg>
<seg id="1688">In advance, enable automatic addition to the collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection.</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can press the arrow key to the left of the Tempo- LCD to slow down playback. to restore the default speed, you can double-click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">I have a & konqueror; -window with my MIDI folder and & kmid; on this desktop (if I play a karaoke file) or attached (if I play a karaoke file). in this way, if the collection is played at the end or I want to play a file, just switch to the & konqueror; window and drag the desired file into the window of & kmid;</seg>
<seg id="1691">If you want to listen to a file just once, without adding it to a collection, turn off the Automatically Add to the collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection. opening files</seg>
<seg id="1692">Let's assume you have the MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so adjust the setting Automatically add to the collection and open A.Schmidt. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file.</seg>
<seg id="1693">Then decide to play B.mid and C.mid and create a collection of all three files. how do you do that?</seg>
<seg id="1694">These people sent me MIDI files or postcards. thank you very much! when I hear these songs or see the postcard, it animates me to program on & kmid; to program.</seg>
<seg id="1695">& kmid; was written by & Antonio.Larrosa.Jimenez; I study mathematics at the University of Maacute; Malaga. at the moment I am in the third year, so I do not have much leisure time for my hobbies, but I try to take a bit of time. as a hobbies I have program, collect MIDI files, make music and propositions.</seg>
<seg id="1696">If you would like to know where to download MIDI / Karaoke files, if you have a question, an error or an idea for an extension of & kmid; or if you just want to make me happy, write me an email: larrosa @ kde.org or antlarr @ arrakis.es</seg>
<seg id="1697">If you send me a postcard or a midi / karaoke file from a local group. all those who send me a postcard or a MIDI file I will record among friends of & kmid; but before you send a MIDI file, you should contact me as I might already have the file.</seg>
<seg id="1698">I have written & kmid; completely written in my spare time and by no one gets money for it. I would like to emphasize that I only continue to programmatically because / when I receive feedback from users (postcards or e-mails).</seg>
<seg id="1699">Takashi Iwai and Joseph H. Bühler - corrected the defect that the pitch of AWE cards was too high.</seg>
<seg id="1700">My thanks also apply to Jose Lus Sanchez for testing the GUS support, Ignacio Garcia for testing AWE support, Has Petter Bieker, Peter Gritsch, Peter Gritsch, Peter-Paul Witta, Thorsten Westheider, Ulrich Cordes and anyone who sent me a patch, an error message or just a supporting email.</seg>
<seg id="1701">And of course, my thanks also to all these outstanding musicians on the web that give us these wonderful MIDI- and karaoke files.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In addition, & kmid can also be found on his homepage, which is found under http: / / www.arrakis.es / ~ rlarrosa / kmid.html. on the homepage you can follow the development, search for information and view pictures. you will also find links to sites with other karaoke songs, etc;</seg>
<seg id="1703">A sound card. I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthesizer because the sound quality depends greatly on your sound card. it is not the same if you use an FM radio or an AWE card.</seg>
<seg id="1704">If you do not have a sound card, you need to compile & kmid; with the parameter MODE _ DEMO _ ONLYVISUAL, it will then run as if you had a sound card, except that you can't hear music of course.</seg>
<seg id="1705">If problems occur, contact one of the & kde; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me.</seg>
<seg id="1706">& SME; is a simple interface for MPlayer, Phono and FFMPEG. the program is used to play video files of formats supported by MPlayer or phonon, and to play DVD s, VCD s or TV and camera.</seg>
<seg id="1707">The documentation for & kappname; was not yet finished than & kde; installed on this computer.</seg>
<seg id="1708">For additional help please check the page The KDE website for new versions, or send the question to The & kde; User mailing list.</seg>
<seg id="1709">The application window is made of so-called docking windows. there is always the window with the central view. optionally there is the window with the playlist. and finally there is an information window that will only be displayed when information is returned.</seg>
<seg id="1710">It is possible to save the preferred connections under the bookmark menu, but these are individual entries. if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other, you should use the category Permanent playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1711">Of course, you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hierarchy level. if you have an entry, its group and all its subgroups will be copied to the current category and the playback begins with the clicked entry.</seg>
<seg id="1712">The categories' current pieces', TV and permanent playlist can also be changed by editing the XML configuration files. of course you can only do that if & SME; not running. just click on a name of a category clicken, select from the View menu and next edit mode. by clicking a subgroup only the XML content of this part is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="1713">After changing XML files, you need to select the playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode, or select another category.</seg>
<seg id="1714">All changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without equal to the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1715">As a result of the convenience of the author of & SME, some features can only be turned on by changing the XML configuration files.</seg>
<seg id="1716">The animation when starting and moving can be disabled by editing ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc and change [General Options] No Intro = 0 above option to '1'. if the option is not available, it can be easily inserted.</seg>
<seg id="1717">It is also possible to activate another animation. & SME; will note the files ~ / .kde / share / apps / SME / intro.xml and ~ / .kde / share / apps / SME / exit.xml. the format must be a supported XML file.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The animation during startup does not need to be short, it is automatically terminated by opening another source. however, this would be annoying at the end-animation, the user can therefore quit the application a second time.</seg>
<seg id="1719">A simple example of a start animation can be the display of a favorite photos: & lt; smilgt; & lt; mimic; & lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt; / lt;</seg>
<seg id="1720">There is a tab for configuring MPlayer in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; here you can set the path from the MPlayer and the cache size of the data stream from the network and other things.</seg>
<seg id="1721">Another tool for troubleshooting is the button 'console' in the toolbar of SME. here is the output of mplayer.</seg>
<seg id="1722">There is no tab for this rendition in the configuration dialog of & KMPlayer; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc like setting up the backend via mimetype. here is an example of how a 'flash' is played with the swfdec-mozilla module:</seg>
<seg id="1723">'Flash 'can be played inside & SME; it can even include the special field embed for YouTube in the playlist XML.</seg>
<seg id="1724">In order for the SMB player to play 'flash' in HTML pages, the & SME needs to be specified as a service provider for the Mime-type application / x-shockwave flash in the setup dialog file mapping of KDE.</seg>
<seg id="1725">The Konqueror or & SME; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding loading the browser module library. if there is no error, the backend output is within & SME. (view, console, or console from the context menu).</seg>
<seg id="1726">To ensure that a pre-existing backend is always taken for a specific Mime type (of course only if this has been determined), it must be done by manual modification of ~ / .kde / share / config / kmplayerrc. for example, it should play all ogg files:</seg>
<seg id="1727">& SME; can be played by TV cards, either by means of a MPlayer or XVideo (this requires kxvplayer). before TV can be seen, the device to use and the TV channels must be configured. to do so, the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually.</seg>
<seg id="1728">To configure the VDR (Video data recorder) settings in the SMB player, the dialog in Settings - &gt; Quelle- &gt; VDR- &gt; XVideo Port should be used. there, ports should be detected (e.g. it is PAL for West Europe), the correct name probably contains a dvb in it.</seg>
<seg id="1729">Since VDR support from SMEs can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). for this reason, the video forlinux extension for the X server must be functional. for this reason, the XFree86 server must be included in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)</seg>
<seg id="1730">This documentation uses dvdnavsource, dvdsource, source, introsource, pipesource, tvscanner, TVSource, url source, vcdsource and vdrsource. when activated, they start playing the playlist.</seg>
<seg id="1731">Are there any references to how I can make my CDROM drive quieter when I play from it (not from the VCD: / /)?</seg>
<seg id="1732">Yes, the hdparm -E 8 / dev / cdrom command is run as root after mounting the device. it is absolutely necessary to make sure that / dev / cdrom displays on the CDROM drive.</seg>

<seg id="1742">Latex;: a professional typeface application. under Unix-like systems it is likely to be applied to the package & textual; and / tetex; (for older systems).</seg>
<seg id="1743">Most of these components may be included in the used & Linux distribution. for the installation, the documentation of the distribution or installation CD; / DVD should be used.</seg>
<seg id="1744">The & Kile; Project contains some pre-compiled packages from & Kile; for various distributions. they allow easy installation without further compiling and are included in the tile; web page.</seg>
<seg id="1745">This manual is for everyone - independent of experiences with & latex;, & kde;, & Kile; or & Linux;.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Advanced users do not have to read this manual. however, all suggestions for documentation are taken into account. if the support for this project or its documentation is desired, the contact over the tile should be made.</seg>
<seg id="1747">If you have any questions about the compilation of & Kile, or if extensions are requested, this should be addressed to the mailing list Kile-devel @ lists.sourceforge.net.</seg>
<seg id="1748">& Kile; is an integrated & latex; environment for the & kde; -Desktop. & Kile; provides the ability to use all & latex; functions in a graphical interface and within it provides easy, immediate and tailor-made access to all & latex.</seg>
<seg id="1749">To learn more about & kate; and its possibilities to learn should be used the manual for Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly by reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1750">For & latex; is the correct language: Lay-TECH. while the original language is difficult to use, a layman (lay) & latex can also be used; a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it derives from the surname of Leslie La mport.</seg>
<seg id="1751">While here only a good natural view to & latex; given, it is not the ultimate book to be used. for example H. Kopka / P. W. Daly, A Guide to & latex should be used;: document Preparation for Beginners and Advanced Users, 3rd Edition, 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1752">The introduction contains at least the command\\ documentclass, the body begins with the command\\ begin {document} and must be closed again with the command\\ end {document} and must be closed with the command\\ end {document}.</seg>
<seg id="1753">The Quick entry Wizard of & Kile; is a useful feature for quick creation of a document in & Kile; the selection of the wizard (menu) offers some options for creating the document. you can also make some settings related to the document.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Document classes: this introduces the type of document to be created: article (article), book [book], cover [report], report [scrartcl], report (DIN) [scrreprt], book (DIN) [scrreprt], projector [beamer], film [Prosper] or user defined.</seg>
<seg id="1755">Encoding: with this the character encoding of the system is set. modern systems increasingly use the UTF-8 encoding as standard. at best UTF-8X should be chosen (for correct processing of the & latex; documents).</seg>
<seg id="1756">This list contains the most frequently used add-on packages for & latex; for inclusion, they only need to be selected in the check box.</seg>
<seg id="1757">Article (DIN), book (DIN), report (DIN), letter (DIN): the document classes of Koma-Script (to comply with German DIN regulations). you should always find use when creating German texts.</seg>
<seg id="1758">New users don't have to worry about this. it's just a short description of the functions and further information on this is given in the section.</seg>
<seg id="1759">& Kile; offers - as well as other source code editors - the highlighting of the commands, settings and elements (as well as the unsuitable). if you see larger areas of a green text on the screen, it is very likely that some mathematical environment has not been closed. however, it is due to the modest appearance of the output file.</seg>
<seg id="1760">With the automatic completion of the environments, when entering a new command (e.g.\\ begin {command}) of & Kile; automatically creates a blank line (for entering the text) and the corresponding line for closing the command (e.g.\\ end {command}).</seg>
<seg id="1761">All documents are normally divided into some elements. & latex; allows the subdivision of the document to be divided into the following elements (part is the most basic and subtle the bottom element):</seg>
<seg id="1762">In the view of the document in the structure view, the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a click of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="1763">When creating your own & latex; files can be very helpful when creating your own file. once a DVI file has been created (engl. D e V ice I nbsp file)], jumps & Kile; by clicking with the middle mouse button in the DVI; -viewer to the corresponding line in & latex; source text.</seg>
<seg id="1764">A DVI; file contains a description of the formatted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the usual output type of & tex; or & latex; There are many tools to view, convert and to print DVI; files for various systems and devices.</seg>
<seg id="1765">When using the text search, the elements of the DVI-file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element is clicked into the DVI; source code is the exact opposite of it. once clicked on a section in & latex; source text is clicked to the appropriate place in DVI; viewer.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Master document: this function is used when working with multiple files. with a master document the work with other involved .tex files is simplified. when using a project, a project-wide master document can be adjusted to project project settings.</seg>
<seg id="1767">Quick construction: the & latex; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed (if there are no errors in the source code).</seg>
<seg id="1768">"" "file Monitoring: in this mode, the DVI file is read on" "" "are unused" "" "and there is no call from & eyepiece, after quick mounting." ""</seg>
<seg id="1769">When viewing the Edit toolbar, the three large selection boxes should be noticed. the selection fields were developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document. the first drop-down box is for the quick structure of the document in parts, chapters, sections,...</seg>
<seg id="1770">The selection field Further is for inserting items such as keywords, notes notes or references. the available options are:</seg>
<seg id="1771">Name: with this command, a term for a section, a picture or other element is created.</seg>
<seg id="1772">Reference: is used for reference to a specified term (choose a selection box possible).</seg>
<seg id="1773">When using quote, a selection list with literary entries is displayed. at & bibtex; this only works if the file belongs to a project. for editing & bibtex; files are required editors. the author has good experience with & kbibtex; and & bibtex; files can also be written in & Kile; by hand.</seg>
<seg id="1774">The last drop-down box with the name GrÃ ¶ is used for setting the font size. you can set the font sizes for the main text, the fox notes, etc. there are the following fonts available:</seg>
<seg id="1775">When calling & Kile, two choices are available: 1. the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings. 2. the document may be written from scratch.</seg>
<seg id="1776">The brackets after the command\\ 'documentclass contain the settings for the command. setting [12pt] specifies the font size. if the font is not set at the beginning, this can also be done in the text.</seg>
<seg id="1777">Once the above source code example has been entered, the source code must be compiled. the easiest way to do this is to use the menu building or button quick construction.</seg>
<seg id="1778">The source code must be saved before compiling. & Kile; automatically executes the storage.</seg>
<seg id="1779">If the compilation of the document fails, it should be searched for errors during logging. if it is not the case, the logging should also be followed automatically. if this is not the case, the logging should also be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1780">An environment (environment) is a text that is treated differently from the rest of the document. for example, a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few columns should have a different font size. the command\\ begin {environment},\\ Huge and\\ end {environment} allows the change of font sizes within the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The changes are only supervised within the environment (from\\ begin {environment} to\\ end {environment}). there is no restriction (number) for changes within an environment.</seg>
<seg id="1782">There are many possibilities to increase the readability and ease of use of the document. for example, certain fonts, bold print, italics, submissions, etc. can be added. these commands end either with the command\\ end or automatically at the end of the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1783">\\ begin {emph}: this command is valid for italics and is valid until it is closed with a\\ end {emph} or any other environment. a single word in a set can be italiciously represented with\\\ emph {word}.</seg>
<seg id="1784">\\ quota: creates a quote in the document. quote starts with\\ begin {quota} and ends with\\ end {rate}.</seg>
<seg id="1785">After the background for writing the source text with the & latex; drawing language is presented, now follows a step-by-step guide for creating a document in & Kile;.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Once a bit of text was entered in the wizard, some adjustments should be made for the better readability of the document. at least, a quote, some places in the fat and italics and a poem should be applied to see the differences of these commands.</seg>
<seg id="1787">Once the document has been viewed, Editor View or Ctrl E can be returned to the editor (in the internal viewer). in case of an external viewer, the window has to be closed.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Once the DVI file has been created, the document can be printed or converted to a & PostScript; / PDF file. just try it out and have fun.</seg>
<seg id="1789">DVI; is an independent file format (engl. D e V ice I nbsp). these files are created by & tex; or & latex; for readability of some drivers of the computer. there are many different types of .dvi output such as printers, & PostScript; / PDF converter or computer screens.</seg>
<seg id="1790">For printing a & DVI file, the same steps are necessary as for the creation of the document (see). at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI, then the document can be printed using File Print (in the viewer) (if the printer is set correctly).</seg>
<seg id="1791">The toolbar permits the conversion of the DVI; file to other formats. as soon as the DVI; file is created from the & latex; source text can begin the conversion into fake other formats by using the buttons in the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="1792">The default search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file.</seg>
<seg id="1793">& Kile; provides a suitable setting for all & latex; files. to do this, simply set up Modern at Settings Kile... tools Build are selected.</seg>
<seg id="1794">In order to select the default search, the mouse cursor must be clicked on a line of the source code and then clicked on. the jump to the corresponding place in the DVI; the viewer is then performed.</seg>
<seg id="1795">With this function in & eyepiece, with a click of the middle mouse button in the DVI; document the corresponding & latex; document by & Kile; open and skip to the corresponding line. to do this, & Kile; in & Okular; set up as text editor... Editor)</seg>
<seg id="1796">If there is no error when using the & DVI, the viewer can have an error. if there is an error, it is displayed in the logging file or in the message window.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The logging file clauses the source of error in the source code. in the editor you can click the Check LaTeX error and NÃ ¤chster LaTeX error for jumps between the errors. the logging file always specifies the line in which the error appears. in order to view the incorrect line, the error must be clicked in the logging and & Kile; jumps to the incorrect line.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Once clicked on the corresponding button in the toolbar, a window will appear to select the template to use for the document. the pre-set options are:</seg>
<seg id="1799">When selecting empty documents, a document may either be rewritten from scratch or the wizard will be used to create a new document. for more information, see the section.</seg>
<seg id="1800">Temporary users of & latex; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents. templates can be created, stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document.</seg>
<seg id="1801">To create a new template, either an existing & tex; - / latex; file must be opened or created a new file. & Kile; can create a new template using an existing document and a selection of file template from document...</seg>
<seg id="1802">When creating a new document from a template using File New, some strings will be replaced by other data (e.g. name or character encoding). these variables can be set up in Settings... settings General.</seg>
<seg id="1803">When creating your own template, it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables:</seg>
<seg id="1804">$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$: this string is replaced by entering into document class. typically, it is used as follows:\\ documentclass [$$DOCUMENTCLASSOPTIONS $$] {item}.</seg>
<seg id="1805">The easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated entry of the commands in the editor. once the document has been created in this way, the following steps must be taken:</seg>
<seg id="1806">When creating a new document, your own template can then be selected instead of the standard one.</seg>
<seg id="1807">A template can be created from any & latex; files will be created. a simple way to create a template should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below.</seg>
<seg id="1808">& Kile; uses & kate; as an internal editor. & kate; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and highlighting many different types of text files (including & latex; and & bibtex;).</seg>
<seg id="1809">To learn more about & kate; and its options should be used the manual for Kate. users of & Kile; can start there directly by reading the chapter works with the editor of & kate; begin.</seg>
<seg id="1810">& Kile; provides a very practical & latex; command reference, which can be called via LaTeX reference. it contains a detailed description of nearly all the commands in & latex; use can be found as well as their syntax.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Double-click with pressed Ctrl key to choose the & tex; word meaning that in this way the\\ par\\ par\\ par\\ par\\ par\\ par is selected.</seg>
<seg id="1812">When dragging the text with left mouse button, the selected text is automatically copied to the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="1813">When using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key, parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window.</seg>
<seg id="1814">& Kile; has the possibility to browse the different types of source code and emphasize these. for example, the different types differ; orders from normal text and also mathematical formulas are highlighted by another color.</seg>
<seg id="1815">Many assistants can add additional diving marks. this is a separate type of bookmark within the text. the menu items Edit bouncing marks or the appropriate keyboard allow the jump to the next or last jump mark. this is also highlighted by the jump mark so that it is automatically deleted when entering a drawing.</seg>
<seg id="1816">Editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program like & Kile; although & kate; already offers excellent possibilities, have been added to & Kile; important functions for writing a & latex; source code always supports many environments and groups and therefore supports & Kile; special commands for their selection.</seg>
<seg id="1817">Choose a complete paragraph (group of lines that contain an empty line on both sides). this extended meaning closes tables, & latex; commands and all other lines of the source code. this is the only worrying thing in & Kile; this means that the sections are separated by two empty lines.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Choose the word under the current cursor position. this selection also has an extended meaning since this command also contains & latex; commands with a return line (\\) and an additional star (*) end up.</seg>
<seg id="1819">To delete a part of the document, this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Delete key. & kate; offers the key word Ctrl; K with which the entire line is removed. under Edit removal, the following commands are included in the text of the text:</seg>
<seg id="1820">Remove a complete paragraph. the definition for a paragraph in & Kile; is included in the description to edit paragraphs.</seg>
<seg id="1821">It has already been clarified that environments play a central role in & latex; therefore, & Kile; for further commands in Edit surroundings for a more simple work with & latex;.</seg>
<seg id="1822">This command will jump to the beginning of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1823">With this command, jump to the end of the current environment (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the command to close the environment.</seg>
<seg id="1824">If the cursor is present before or within the command\\ begin {environment}, jump to the end of the environment (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1825">When entering many nested ambient commands, the overlook can be lost quickly. this command closes the last desired environment, so that the nested environment structure is not destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1826">& Kile; also offers special commands for the & latex; groups that are determined by brackets {...}. under Edit TeX group are some important commands that match those from editing environment.</seg>
<seg id="1827">With this command, jump to the beginning of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly in front of the curly opening bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1828">With this command, jump to the end of the current group (no matter where the current position is). the cursor is placed directly behind the curly closing bracket.</seg>
<seg id="1829">If the cursor is before or behind the welded bracket of a & tex; -group #, jump to the other end of the group (or vice versa).</seg>
<seg id="1830">When entering many nested groups parentheses can quickly get lost over time. this command closes the last formed group so that the nested structure of the parentheses will not be destroyed.</seg>
<seg id="1831">In & latex; two simple applications are used as a substitute. for the purpose-bringing implementation, the sign is used in & Kile; the sign "for two simple instructions is used. also for the end of the execution the sign" is used. "and Kile; knows this case and includes two closing quotes for & latex; one.</seg>
<seg id="1832">This automatic filing of double quotes can be set up under Preferences... LaTeX can be switched on and off.</seg>
<seg id="1833">It can also be used to set specific settings (e.g. ngerman or French) and thus German or French quotes. there are also many other languages available.</seg>
<seg id="1834">When pressing Shift; Enter key & Kile; an intelligent line breaks. if the current position is within a list environment (e.g. enumerate or itemize), & Kile; not just a line breaks but at the same time the command\\ item.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Close & Kile within a tables environment; the current line with\\\\ with an end-to-end line breaks off.</seg>
<seg id="1836">Even better - & Kile; is intelligent enough to support pre-set & latex; - or user-defined environments. these can be set up under Settings... LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Some users want to arrange the columns in tables environments and all Et characters (amp;) to each other. when pressing Shift; Alt; amp; searches & Kile; after the next tab in the above line. even though this tab is not the same, add & Kile; add some gaps for the columns position of the current tab.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Although & kate; already a good source code completion offers, this has been expanded in & Kile; for specific commands (mostly for & latex;) are built-in. three of them work according to requirements and the other two are for automatic completion. all these modes can be set up for different working modes under Preferences... Complete.</seg>
<seg id="1839">When starting a new environment using the command\\ begin {environment} & Kile; automatically add the command\\ end {environment} after an empty line (for text).</seg>
<seg id="1840">When pressing the back button, the last letter of the input is removed and generously grabs the completion list. on the other hand, the list can also shrink by entering another letter.</seg>
<seg id="1841">All commands are written with a short description of their parameters. alternatively, the descriptions are removed by selecting a command. alternatively, jump marks can be inserted, so that an easy jump to these positions by editing jumps is possible and the desired parameters can then be meshed.</seg>
<seg id="1842">Settings Kile; set up... Kile; All settings can be made to these lists. you can select different list lists for & tex; - and & latex; orders as well as users of the general language use.</seg>
<seg id="1843">The command mode is not useful for the completion of environments. there are always a few letters with\\ begin typed and the call of completion mode will result in a large list of ambient conditions. on the other hand, the environments are used so often that & Kile; a special mode for completion of environments.</seg>
<seg id="1844">When invoking the execution mode via the menu Edit Full environment or the key Alt + Shift key, the command is automatically inserted to open the environment and it appears\\ begin. afterwards, the ambient temperature can be continued in the simplest way and by pressing the input key will be terminated.</seg>
<seg id="1845">Once this is done, the environment will automatically be closed again. once & while, realize that it is a list environment, it will even be a first\\ item command.</seg>
<seg id="1846">Under Settings Kile; set up... Kile; All settings can be made to these lists. this mode uses the drop list of the Compensation mode for & tex; - and & latex; commands.</seg>
<seg id="1847">The lists can be set up under Settings Kile. as an example of a drop-down list, the example.cwl file is used, for example, the file example.cwl, in which for example the entry L =\\ LaTeX is included.</seg>
<seg id="1848">For example, if the letter L is entered and the word will be applied to the word processing mode over the menu editing or keyboard Ctrl + Alt empty space, the letter L will be replaced by the string\\ LaTeX.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Large windows are not helpful for automatic processing. however, it has been found that many people in a document are written more than once. therewith, & Kile; the completion for all already written wishes.</seg>
<seg id="1850">This mode can be set up in the menu settings Kile... Kile can be switched off. here, the threshold value can also be set for the display of the complete damage.</seg>
<seg id="1851">The completion files can be installed in the subfolder ~ / .kde / share / apps / kile / complete / mode / of the Persian home folder. mode stands for Abbreviation, Dictionary (WÃ ¶ rterbuch) or tex.</seg>
<seg id="1852">The graphic design allows you to create graphics as simple as possible. to view the basics of graphics formats, the sections should be followed.</seg>
<seg id="1853">PS files are not as known as PDF files but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages. if the PDF output is notified, the pages can be rearranged with a few & PostScript; tools and then converted into a PDF file with ps2pdf.</seg>
<seg id="1854">In order to examine the result of the work, you need to compile the source code. all construction tools are grouped in groups in the creation compiling, creating conversion and creating views.</seg>
<seg id="1855">For compiling the source code for viewer such as & eyepiece, or the other conversion can be used by pressing Alt; 2. afterwards, the DVI file can be viewed in the standard viewer by Alt; 3, by Alt; 4 the DVI; file converted into a PS file and by Alt; 5 the PS file.</seg>
<seg id="1856">When using the Schnellbahn command, normally a viewer is invoked after compiling. if no built-in viewer should be used, a new window will open every time.</seg>
<seg id="1857">A new project will be asked about the project New Project.... Hierbei will ask the following information for the project:</seg>
<seg id="1858">When selecting the file name window, the relative path must be specified by the .kilepr project file.</seg>
<seg id="1859">The Script function of & Kile; allows the execution of ECMAScript code. scripts can be administered via scripts in the vertical ledger.</seg>
<seg id="1860">The API scripts are not yet fully developed and can be used in other versions of & Kile.</seg>

<seg id="1934">The name and email entries are self-explanatory. nickname is the nickname of the user and is used for unique identification.</seg>
<seg id="1935">One member can have several roles in the project, such as team leaders and sub-project leaders.</seg>
<seg id="1936">The user can choose from the list of team members who he is. this is done by selecting the team member from the list and pressing the button. the currently selected member (their identity) appears bold after you are: text.</seg>
<seg id="1937">Nicknames and the attitude of one's own identity are important in terms of news and comments. see for further information on comments.</seg>
<seg id="1938">In addition to an overview of their team, there is another advantage by capturing members of the team: an event for information can be created to the team leaders when something is happening. see for further information.</seg>
<seg id="1939">Event actions are actions that are executed when something is happening in the project. one example would be to record the opening and closing of the project, so that later on how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up, or a script that plays a file into CVS, as soon as it is added to the project & etc;</seg>

<seg id="1949">The behavior of & quantaplus; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this. the entries are:</seg>
<seg id="1950">Large / lowercase of tags: large / lowercase of automatically inserted tags. normal size / lowercase means the tags are inserted in the way they are described in the tagxml files.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Large / lowercase of attributes: large / lowercase of automatically inserted attributes. normal size / lowercase means the attributes are inserted in such a way as described in the tagxml files.</seg>

<seg id="1953">Automatically close optional tags: as above for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Update start and end tag automatically: if enabled, the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Automatic setting of accent characters: controls the automatic conversion of accented characters to the corresponding encoding during typing.</seg>
<seg id="1956">MIME types: facial expressions for the recognition of different types of files. the default settings can be restored using the Standard button.</seg>
<seg id="1957">Standard drawing encoding: the encoding of newly created or otherwise opened files (where the encoding of the file can be passed). however, this setting here is ejected from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Standard DTD: the selected DTD will be used for newly created files, or for files whose DTD has not been recognized. however, this setting here is expelled from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded.</seg>
<seg id="1959">Creating a backup copy: & quantaplus; creates regular backup copies so that in case of a power failure or crash when starting the program the document can be restored from this backup. this is not the same as saving the file. also for unsaved documents, a backup is created regularly, according to the set time.</seg>
<seg id="1960">The preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one's own view (or the documentation in a tab), which makes it possible to view the documentation, preview and source code at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="1965">In the mouse click on the structure tree, the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="1966">In the structure tree settings, the visibility of nodes in the tree, the update frequency of the tree when editing and how deep in a change in the structure tree is to be opened automatically. empty nodes are the empty areas in the text, while empty groups are such that no element has been found in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Abbreviations are divided into groups, each can be valid for several & DTEP; s. this means that there can be a valid group for PHP in which the ifclause abbreviation means something different than in a group valid for Javascript.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Here the plug-ins can be managed. plugins are KPart applications from the third side, which can be reused by any part-capable application, at the most known & konqueror;. when inserting a plug-in, the following must be specified:</seg>
<seg id="1969">Address: the path to the plugin when it is not located on a standard as $KDEDIR / lib.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Input: this information is passed to the plugin when you start, so it can open the current file, the associated folder (path of current file) or the project folder.</seg>
<seg id="1971">"" "component in" "" "Read-Only" "" "mode: check if the plugin refuses to load. only read-only parts usually refuse to load if this option is not selected." ""</seg>
<seg id="1972">Check the plugin: if this is enabled, then test & quantaplus; whether the entered information is right. pick the entry then even if the plugin is not available at the moment, but it should be installed later.</seg>
<seg id="1973">For & quantaplus; from version 3.3, debugging has been completely redeveloped. the support for the no more necessary built-in & PHP; (3) debugger was adjusted, as well as the support for the DBG debugger. instead, a debugger plugin concept was implemented that allows various implementations via plugins.</seg>
<seg id="1974">Currently, only one plugin is available, the support for the use of & gubed; inquantaplus; inserts.</seg>
<seg id="1975">Using the debugger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable debugger plugin in the project settings. with the Options button next to the Debugger plugin, the specific settings can be changed.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If a debugger is enabled for a project, some additional elements appear in the & quantaplus; user interface:</seg>
<seg id="1977">A view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed. usually appears in the left Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A view where all stops, with time numbers and conditions are listed. usually appears in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1979">A view in which the output (as in HTML) of the debugger is shown. appears normally in the lower Dock.</seg>
<seg id="1980">Depending on the supported functions of the debugger, everything or part of the following functionality is available.</seg>
<seg id="1981">With this action, the link to debugger, if necessary, is made, or it tells the plugin to listen to debugging requirements. this action is triggered by default when a project is opened that uses a debugger, so that normally you don't have to pay attention to it.</seg>
<seg id="1982">The counterpart to Debugger session starts the session. closes the connection to the debugger or terminates the listening to requirements.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Sends an HTTP request to the server to request a debug requirement. this is synonymous with the use of a browser to view the current document. the output of this request is displayed in the Debugger output.</seg>
<seg id="1984">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script and sending information about the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line. if this happens while the script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it happens before a debugging request has been started, the script starts with the request.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Instructs the debugger to start executing the script without sending information to overloaded variables and the current row number. if this happens while a script is stopped, the execution will continue. if it is given before a debugging request is given, the execution will start as soon as a request is made.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The Debugger performs the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include.</seg>
<seg id="1987">The Debugger performs the next instruction in the script, where possible in functions and include.</seg>
<seg id="1988">Instruct the debugger to pass the instruction and go to the next as if there were no current.</seg>
<seg id="1989">Opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered, which should be monitored. the monitored value appears in the variable view.</seg>
<seg id="1990">With this dialog a variable can be entered or set a new value of a variable.</seg>

<seg id="1993">Document type Editing packages (DTEP; s) are used in & quantaplus; to give support for Markup and scripting languages as well as & CSS; they enable & quantaplus. their simplicity and flexibility make of & quantaplus; a fast, user-friendly & IDE; for web developers, easy to use and productive.</seg>
<seg id="1994">& DTEP; s are available in two types, family 1, the Markup languages and family 2, the script languages or & CSS; s & DTEP; s consist of two file types, the tag folder and toolbars. tag folders are handy, symbolic buttons of frameworks (above the editing window), insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than a user could ever.</seg>
<seg id="1995">& DTEP; s can be created manually (see below), downloaded or created automatically from an existing DTD. see for details of conversion.</seg>
<seg id="1996">This document describes how to create TagXML files, then the & descriptionrc; and also tool lists. in short, a & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="1997">Tag XML files (.tag) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog, the & quantaplus; file contains the rules and information of the & DTEP; even. toolbars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without risk of a writing error.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Tag folders are nothing but folders. they contain only the file descriptionrc; and the tag XML files. tag folder bears the name of the description language and version, so available. (for example, html-4.01-strict)</seg>
<seg id="1999">The table below lists the elements of tag XML and declares whether they are necessary, or not. although not all are necessary, it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have better insight and more information in working with them.</seg>
<seg id="2000">The following chapter describes each element in detail. everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way.</seg>
<seg id="2001">This is the root element of a tag XML document. it can only occur once in a document. it can contain the definition of many tags, but contains nothing but only element type above itself.</seg>
<seg id="2002">The type of tag is a script function. when used, attr &gt; is an argument of the function. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2003">Valid only for class class. the name of the base class for this class. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2004">Only valid for the type method. indicates the name of the class where this method belongs. (only family 2)</seg>
<seg id="2005">If yes, the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within that tag can be added to any other day. (only family 1)</seg>
<seg id="2006">Sets a text into the dialog. this text is defined by the & lt; text &gt; tag. this is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Specifies an attribute of a tag. this element can only occur once for each attribute. it specifies the name and type of the attribute. in addition, it contains other tags that describe how this attribute is to be displayed & etc; This is a only element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Returns the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree</seg>
<seg id="2009">Requires source = dcop. the dcop interface within & quantaplus is used to achieve the source data.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Requires source = dcop and the name of an interface. the dcop method name within & quantaplus is used to achieve the data source.</seg>
<seg id="2011">Requires source = dcop, an interface and method name. the arguments passed to the method can be empty or% day name%, which means the name of the current tags.</seg>
<seg id="2012">A container tag which grouped the elements of a list together. it can only occur once for an attribute description. it is an element type element.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Specifies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog. this tag can occur only once for each attribute in a dialog (e.g. once for each attribute; attr &gt; tag). the element is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Specifies the position and size of a field in the dialog. this tag should be present for each field in the dialog (e.g. one for each & lt; attr &gt; and & lt; label &gt; Tag). this item is empty.</seg>
<seg id="2015">Specifies a list of elements that may appear within the tags to be defined. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Specifies a list of elements that end a tag. this element is an only element type.</seg>
<seg id="2017">All Tagged XML files must start with an XML; & lt;? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF-8? &gt; and must be neatly chained and closed.</seg>
<seg id="2018">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt;, especially in elements such as & lt; tooltip &gt;, & lt; text &gt; will not cause leg breakage, but some pieces of work would disappear.</seg>
<seg id="2019">To check the TagXML files, the Tools dialog is displayed at the top of the & quantaplus; window to start and check TagXML. a further dialog will appear, whose simple instructions are to follow.</seg>
<seg id="2020">This feature is currently not available yet. currently, the check is only done when charging the TagXML files in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2021">The following is an example of a family 1 tagged XML file. this file describes & lt; schema &gt; element from the W3C; & XML; schema. the filename for this TagXML file should be schema.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2022">In the following an example of a working family 2 tag XML file. in this file a & PHP; Excel function is described. the filename of this TagXML file should be overload.tag.</seg>
<seg id="2023">& lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; & lt; tag name = "overload" type = "void" &gt; & lt; attr name = "class _ name" type = "optional" / &gt; & lt; / day &gt; & lt; / tags &gt;</seg>
<seg id="2024">The & descriptionrc; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it, accessible via DTD Edit DTD settings. thus, diedescriptionrc; for a new created & DTEP; for a newly created & DTEP; should be created a simple & descriptionrc; with the following entries:</seg>
<seg id="2025">[general] Version = User 1 for & quantaplus; version & lt; = 3.1.2 and 2 for each higher version. name = DTD. (- / / W3C; / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN) No. (HTML 4.01 Transitional).</seg>
<seg id="2026">An action can be set with Settings actions... to create. click New Action leads to the same dialog:</seg>
<seg id="2027">The key shortcut assigned to this action. clicking the User Language button can be used to assign a shortcut; with K1 the current keyboard shortcut can be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2028">The simplest actions. a text can be entered in the Detaiated Settings and when executing the action, this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position. see the example below.</seg>
<seg id="2029">This is the most powerful action type. with the help of this action, external applications (usually scripts, but it is not limited) that can change the document or use it as input (or parts of the document), are started. examples from & quantaplus; even the quick start dialog or the various see in... actions for the (X) HTML DTEPs.</seg>
<seg id="2030">First the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed, it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line, such as sh% script / share / apps / Quanta / scripts local script folder: $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / scripts in their path: $PATH There are other special variables that can be used in the command line:</seg>
<seg id="2032">% f: we replaced with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name is removed.</seg>
<seg id="2033">% pid: will be replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus; only one instance is running, the text unique is added to the PID number. this is useful if DCOP is used to control & quantaplus; by the external script.</seg>
<seg id="2034">The parameters for this event, usually the filename of the current document or the path to the project file.</seg>
<seg id="2035">In addition to the methods listed above, a script can receive input from & quantaplus; in the input field input can be determined which is to be sent to the default input. possibilities are:</seg>
<seg id="2036">Selected text: the selected area of the document is sent to the script. the% input variable is usually only useful with this setting.</seg>
<seg id="2037">According to the input, the output of the exported application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: regular output, written to the standard output; error messages indicating the standard error output. it can be specified what to do with the text written on the standard output by setting the value of the output box output:</seg>
<seg id="2038">If there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to divide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary to create your own toolbar for each group. in the given case, it is not too many, so you can create a toolbar with the name of the tag.</seg>
<seg id="2039">Once a tool bar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Settings to set actions.</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are quite self-explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts the editing mode.</seg>
<seg id="2041">Complete all required fields and add the tag to the appropriate toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2042">Complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan to use it, enable "Edit Day" dialog when available so that input when using the action is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2043">Ignore! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">To create a symbol that the action represents better, we will use & kiconedit; select from the & KMenu;, Graphics more programs (or where else it is located in your distribution).</seg>
<seg id="2045">& kiconedit; uses 32x32 pixel by default, but we need 22x22. to change this, select Edit size.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does, but also to all other users of the & DTEP;.</seg>
<seg id="2047">With regard to the fact that the day starts, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green will mostly be interpreted as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user will be signaled to insert this symbol; start; tag in the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2048">After creating the symbol, it still needs to be connected to the action. this is done via the menu with Settings actions... (in & quantaplus;) and select the desired action. next to the text box is a button, press it.</seg>
<seg id="2049">Select the folder where the stored icon is located, select it and confirm with OK.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Press the Apply button and continue with other tags, so it still exists, or confirm with OK to complete.</seg>
<seg id="2051">Suppose you want to add some common & quantaplus; functions to the toolbar, or it should be divided into several groups for a better overview by some separators. open the tool bar to set a dialog using Settings Toolbars. make sure the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">I want to select the separator (at the top left) for my toolbar. after selecting the item to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow key to the right. this adds the element to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2053">For example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar has to be tested by absorbing all the symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">If NeweXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be saved in the correct folder. please adjust your file descriptionrc; so that your toolbar (s) will be loaded () when a file is opened by the corresponding type.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable extension of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like best. this is why this chapter describes how to create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">Before starting your own documentation, you could check in & quantaplus; - Repository check if someone has done that for you.</seg>
<seg id="2059">There are two parts in this process. first you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; language. then you need to create the docrc file. we leave the first part to you, the second we will handle here.</seg>
<seg id="2060"># KDE Configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = Path, relative to this file, to the documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the Main Index Top element = your description for these documentation e.g. & PHP; 4.2 Documentation Section 1 = Section1.html Sec2.1 = Section1.html tag1 = tag1.html tag1 = tag2.html tag3 = tag3html</seg>
<seg id="2061">The tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation now; documentation like this:</seg>
<seg id="2062"># KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level Element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = Table of Contents, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic-syntaxes...</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known boundary for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequently at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder is displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing, but watch & & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; and & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">The content section is the area of the docrc file used to design context-sensitive help. for example, when writing one & PHP; scripts to display the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function. by selecting the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (ContextList) and the file link lines.</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated context elements to be available (for & PHP;, these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>
<seg id="2069">If you are certain that this is good and it is worth to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, e.g. which documentation was used to the & quantaplus; -community. they will not be rich, but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform.</seg>
<seg id="2070">With & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the failed resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:</seg>
<seg id="2071">The resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or otherwise. at different places there is an Email-mail menu entry, such as DTD DTD packet (DTEP) with email, tool bar toolbars with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and in the script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2072">The resources can be uploaded to our main archive, from where all the other & quantaplus; users can download them. to make a useful contribution, we recommend signing the resources for which it needs a GPG / PGP key. thus, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for later users.</seg>
<seg id="2073">When uploading, you will be asked for their passphrase for their private gpg key (the passphrase will not be saved), or in the event that you have multiple keys, you can choose one. in the New resource dialog, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2074">Uploading can be uploaded from the DTD DTD package (DTEP), uploading toolbar toolbar and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and script tree.</seg>
<seg id="2075">After downloading a resource, before installation, examined & quantaplus; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing. in case of problems it warns and it can then be aborted. please note the warning messages carefully. if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed, a message appears with the indication of the author of the resource.</seg>
<seg id="2076">It is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus; however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in day XML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD to a DTEP package automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2077">The conversion can be started from the DTD Load and Convert menu of a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD Description that should be used. afterwards, the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2078">Target directory name: the newly created & DTEP; is written with this name in the $KDEHOME / share / apps / Quanta / dtep folder.</seg>
<seg id="2079">! Doctype definition line: the string that is in! doctype Tag, such as HTML PUBLIC - / / W3C / / DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional / / EN http: / / www.w3.org / TR / HTML4 / loose.dtd</seg>
<seg id="2080">Fine adjustment of the DTEP after conversion: when activated, & quantaplus; after conversion the & descriptionrc; editor, with the details of the newly created & DTEP; it is recommended to use this option.</seg>
<seg id="2081">In & quantaplus, there are some key concepts. in order to understand these and full benefits from & quantaplus, one must first familiarize oneself with these fundamental concepts. this chapter tries to teach them exactly these concepts, without their understanding & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2082">In & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus;.</seg>
<seg id="2083">Global elements are available for each, the & quantaplus; it stores everything that is marked as global, in the common folder structure of & quantaplus; this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool lists, actions and patterns in the global tree, which is then available to everyone in a multi-user environment.</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be all of & CSS; pattern up to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply put, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, resulting in the common use of special tools and patterns by all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">The & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of some main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the card readers with information and the toolbars. please suggest in, and for more information on these areas.</seg>
<seg id="2087">You can click on the tab with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as closing, deleting, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmark or execution of CVS commands to the current document.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Right-click in the editor area leads to a further context menu with regard to the processed document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste / paste), editing the tags under the mouse cursor, help to the word under the mouse cursor or open the file, if the string is called a file under the mouse cursor.</seg>
<seg id="2089">At the top of the editor window are the editor's toolbar. currently, & quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional as the default for which a set of toolbars is shown. in the course of further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs.</seg>
<seg id="2090">The use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; then click on the icon that represents the tag. now you can enter the data for this straight inserted day. if you want to insert a tag that has multiple attributes (such as anchors), you can fill in a dialog different fields.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The tree views (QIT;) allow you to navigate to & quantaplus; to navigate, open them and rove them. in the presentation with card readers are available for files, project, templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation tree views.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Project Management is a powerful tool, the & quantaplus; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing the files in the project using right mouse click. actions such as Add, Remove, Upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be done with the context menu displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Another possibility of & quantaplus; is the use of templates. almost everything can be a template: pictures, program parts, a whole website & etc. all possibilities are open to you.</seg>
<seg id="2094">Templates can be divided into three categories depending on the context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects can only be used in the project.</seg>
<seg id="2095">Here you will find information about the available scripting languages. the concept of integration into Global, Local and Project also works here. by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information to a script. by clicking with the right mouse button further functions are available, such as the script to start, edit or email it.</seg>
<seg id="2096">This view shows the internal structure of the active document. by clicking on an element, the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element. by clicking on an element, a list of commands opens in relation to navigation and refresher of the tree.</seg>
<seg id="2097">This tree appears among the other tree views. with it, it can quickly change attributes and namespaces. the entry system aligned to the content allows the change of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development. you can download pre-packed documentation for & quantaplus; from the quantaplus; 'Documentation site, you can create your own documentation, and by adding a folder doc to a project, project-specific documentation can be added, edited and viewed.</seg>
<seg id="2099">By default, & quantaplus; two tab trackers at the bottom of the window can be accessed using the useful information: the message window and the problem window.</seg>
<seg id="2100">This tab displays information about each script running in Quanta. for example, the currently used DTD of the current document and all changes to DTD will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2101">This tab displays all errors in the markup of the current document. & quantaplus; scripts executed, give all error messages (so there are) in this window.</seg>
<seg id="2102">The toolbar buttons are extensive and easy to understand. show them on a symbol and they will display the appropriate command. the chocolate side of the toolbar is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Another function of & quantaplus; is the ability to send a toolbar with EMail. & quantaplus; sends the toolbar as compressed Tar archive via & kmail; if they receive a toolbar in an email, they can backup and load them in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2104">It is reasonable if you want to customize the location of the & quantaplus. autoconf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script. to get a complete list of all options, enter. / configure --help. the options are easy to understand and not executed here.</seg>
<seg id="2105">If you have problems starting & quantaplus, you should check if your path contains the & kde; 3 bin folder. also, you should make sure that no older version of & kde; 3 in the PATH is located in front of your bin folder. the same goes for & Qt;.</seg>
<seg id="2106">& quantaplus; is a web development tool for the KDE surface. & quantaplus; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions.</seg>
<seg id="2107">While the effort to create the best & HTML editor, the developers of & quantaplus began to deal with a obvious idea: what would be if & quantaplus; an independent, expandable markup languages editor? well, this would make him the most amazing web development tool for & kde; so it was done.</seg>
<seg id="2108">No longer on pure & HTML; limited, is & quantaplus; now already far on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool. summarized: if you can define it in & XML; then & quantaplus; for this the suitable & IDE; be.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Well, to the above claim must be stated that & quantaplus; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire & kde; developer community is based. thanks to the & kde; scaffold is not only this all possible, but it allows users and developers, & quantaplus; to expand as they need for their needs.</seg>
<seg id="2110">& quantaplus; allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi-document surface (MDI;). this can dramatically increase productivity. by using self-knitted actions, scripts and toolbars, automation is almost every task.</seg>
<seg id="2111">& Quanta; Plus; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages. it was designed for fast web development and was quickly converted to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features.</seg>
<seg id="2112">& Quanta; Plus is in no way associated with commercial versions of & Quanta; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program.</seg>
<seg id="2113">More in the detailed documentation is with help: / Quanta (either this URL in & konqueror; enter, or khelpcenter help: / Quanta).</seg>
<seg id="2114">& Quanta; currently developed and supervised by Eric Laffoon Sequitur @ kde.org and Andras Mantia amantia @ kde.org.</seg>
<seg id="2115">A quick access list of files that you have opened. this list changes every time you open a file that is not located where the oldest record is taken out.</seg>
<seg id="2116">This allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use. if you want to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder, only one error will be reported.</seg>
<seg id="2117">Converts special characters to & HTML from the clipboard, so that they are displayed correctly and not be misunderstood by the browser as formatting instruction.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Converts text from clipboard to & URL; Description which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in & URL; s is. primarily to insert & URL; s used in the anchor day.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Switches the block selection to or off. this allows you to select text blocks using the & Shift key.</seg>
<seg id="2120">Go directly to a row number. this is very helpful when your & PHP script releases error messages!</seg>
<seg id="2121">Searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory. a kind grep or sed with GUI and predefined expressions to help you.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Displays the message window or not. this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and debugger.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Switching and switching the problem reporter at the bottom of the & quantaplus; main window. the problem reporter is activated as soon as you change to the structure tree.</seg>
<seg id="2124">Displays the toolbar left of the main window. this column allows you to set bookmarks with a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2125">When there are bookmarks in the current file, they will appear in the menu along with the entries Previous or Next, depending on the position of the cursor in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2126">Bookmarks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped according to the file name of the other documents.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Opens an existing project from the hard disk. & quantaplus; projects are stored with the extension .webprj.</seg>
<seg id="2128">Presents a dialog for inserting files into the current project. the selected files will then be copied to the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2129">Searches the project directory for new files that could be there. this allows, for example, to copy graphics files to your project folder or subfolder and then add them to the project.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Loads the files in your project on the server. the list of available transport methods depends on your version of & kde; and whether you have downloaded further input / output modules (KIO slaves).</seg>
<seg id="2131">Settings, such as & quantaplus, manage the project. in chapter & quantaplus, you will find the details.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Loads a project toolbar. these are stored in project / toolbars and are only in this menu if you have assigned them to this project.</seg>
<seg id="2133">A dialog to store your tool bar. allows you to select the type of toolbar: locally or project.</seg>
<seg id="2134">Opens a dialog to add a new toolbar. this creates only the name. actions must be added to the toolbar by Settings.... toolbar buttons are stored via toolbar toolbar or you will be asked if you want to save the toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2135">Removes a toolbar from the field of view. this does not delete it from the hard drive. if you haven't saved the toolbar yet, you'll be asked if you want to do that.</seg>
<seg id="2136">This allows you to send your own toolbar to someone (perhaps to the & quantaplus; team for the toolbar to be present in the next release). the menu item opens a new email message with the toolbar as appendix.</seg>
<seg id="2137">Enables uploading of toolbars to the main server, where every other can access it. see in.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Load a & DTD; you or anyone else made and convert to the & quantaplus; own description format.</seg>
<seg id="2139">Load / refresh the entities from the & DTD; it makes sense if the entities from the & DTD; should be refreshed without the whole & DTEP; if this is global and there is no write permission in the global KDE folder, the load fails.</seg>
<seg id="2140">This menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded toolbar. if the default (HTML;) toolbar is loaded, there is a sub-menu standard in the Tags menu which contains the list of tags / actions on this toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2141">Allows access to the current tag setting dialog when there is one. this entry is always present in the Tags menu, followed by & DTD; -specific submenus.</seg>
<seg id="2142">Activates or deactivates the intelligent insertion of tags. currently, this only works with (X) HTML DTDs. intelligent insertion means that & quantaplus; inserting by tool bar is denied if this tag contradicts the rules at this place.</seg>
<seg id="2143">In the plug-in menu, the available plug-ins are listed under the menu items listed above. click on it. click on an activated plug-in to disable it.</seg>
<seg id="2144">Select the syntax highlighting mode for the current file. the list of available highlighting schemes depends on the current version.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Selects the type of line identifier. very useful when you know people using other OS platforms for developing. choose Unix, Windows / DOS or Macintosh.</seg>
<seg id="2146">Checks the syntax of the current document using the selected & DTD; using the external application tidy.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Immediate switching between different types of user interface. due to some limitations in the KDE libraries, switching can sometimes require time or unsightly graphics. recommended is the card-card mode, which is also the default setting, or the sub-window mode, which corresponds to the representation in & quantaplus; 3.2 and earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2148">In addition, this menu provides an entry for each open sub-window. selecting an insert will activate the corresponding sub-window.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Enables the display of the status bar at the lower edge of the & quantaplus; main window at or off.</seg>
<seg id="2150">The changes in this dialog will affect any application using the KHTML part, including the & konqueror; web browser.</seg>
<seg id="2151">Set the behavior of the editor window. in the documentation of & kate; you can find details.</seg>
<seg id="2152">A dialog appears where you can delete entries from the toolbar or add which ones you can add and change the sequences.</seg>
<seg id="2153">This should create a help corresponding to the environment of the mouse pointer but is not implemented yet.</seg>
<seg id="2154">& quantaplus; is a high quality product that is freely available and licensed, but as with any open source project developers can always use help. if they want to support the & quantaplus, they find the way here.</seg>
<seg id="2155">The fields are self-explanatory and should be filled with the best from top to bottom, since, for example, after filling the project name, the whole directory structure is automatically completed for the rest of the project. all these paths and author information fields can later be set using Shift; F7 Project Properties Project Properties.</seg>
<seg id="2156">Here is the name for the project, for example foo. when entering Name, file will be filled automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2157">This is the name of the project file. by default, it has the name of the project in lowercase letters and without spaces with extension webprj (eg foo.webboj). this file is stored in the project directory.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access, unless you edit local data. either a name (hostname.exempl.de) or an IP address (127.0.0.1) are possible.</seg>
<seg id="2159">If you leave this field empty, the default settings of the chosen protocol will be used. depending on the setting of the remote host, an adjustment could be necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2160">This is the folder where the templates are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and templates. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2161">This is the folder where the toolbars are stored for the project. it is a relative path to the project and toolbars by default. if a shared collection of files is used for different projects, this folder should be set instead of the standard.</seg>
<seg id="2162">This allows you to insert files from the local filesystem to the project. multiple files or entire folders can be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2163">This setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change. with server-side scripts (e.g. & PHP;, Python, & etc;) you have to proceed differently.</seg>
<seg id="2164">Tap if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project should be integrated. if a project is started from scratch, do not hook up.</seg>
<seg id="2165">With this option, all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make a precise selection according to your discretion.</seg>
<seg id="2166">This shows a list of files in the main folder. you can select the desired files by hooks or by removing the checkbox, clips from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2167">The last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work. these settings can be uploaded in the Project Properties menu in the menu tree in the subwindow Profile or with Shift + F7 keyboard shortcut.</seg>
<seg id="2168">Some settings correspond to those in the project wizard and are described in. the additional entries are explained below.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A list of filenames (placeholders possible) that are re-read in project-related operations such as project folders.</seg>
<seg id="2170">Additional option to the top, also files listed in .cvsignor, are excluded from the project.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The project view, which is loaded when the project is opened, can be read more about project views.</seg>
<seg id="2172">This allows you to select the debugger you want. currently, only gubed is supported. more information about gubed can be found in. debugger plugin can be configured with the Options button. troubleshooting is described.</seg>
<seg id="2173">In the Profile tab, Upload Profiles (see in) can be set as well as displaying a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by adjusting its own tree view for each profile.</seg>
<seg id="2174">In the team configuration subwindow, project members can be added, edited or deleted as well as a mailing list. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2175">In the event configuration subwindow, you can turn event actions and add, change or delete event actions. event actions are executed when a previously determined event occurs, such as securing a file. see the details.</seg>
<seg id="2176">By default, & quantaplus; the last project that was opened. you can't influence this behavior at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="2177">To open another project, select Open Project... from the Project menu or the Project icon open from the toolbar. the dialog project is displayed and allows the selection of a project. projects have .webprj as an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2178">When & quantaplus; closed, the project file will be saved automatically. you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving, if & quantaplus; changed files. the same happens when you load a new project.</seg>
<seg id="2179">The project manager gives free access to the files in the project. there the files can be managed in the current project.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Folders behave as well, but the entries are missing and open with... with the right mouse button context menu:</seg>
<seg id="2181">Here you can select different profiles. the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files. see.</seg>
<seg id="2182">Allows you to remove the current profile. if only one profile is available, the button will be blended to prevent removing.</seg>
<seg id="2183">The password will be kept in the kernel memory and forgotten when logging in. this option is useful if frequent uploading of files is necessary and the rather unsafe password will not be saved on the disk -option.</seg>
<seg id="2184">This will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before uploading.</seg>
<seg id="2185">In & quantaplus, many flood profiles can be created and thus the project (or parts of the project) can be uploaded to different servers. when editing or creating a profile, this dialog is displayed:</seg>
<seg id="2186">This is the name of the server to which the files should be copied. either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The transfer protocol for uploading. the list depends on the version of & kde; and the installed kio slaves. at least you should choose from & FTP;, file (local) and nfs.</seg>
<seg id="2188">The port for the transfer. normally, this does not need to be changed, except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Depending on your anxiety threshold, this is either a time-saving function or danger. use it after your discretion. the password is stored on the disk, so it cannot be read easily, but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text.</seg>
<seg id="2190">A project view is just one set of files and toolbars. there can be many views in a project, i.e. by simply changing the view, various files and toolbars can be loaded and replace the currently open files and toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Views can be opened, opened or deleted in the Project or Project toolbar, accessible via the toolbar Project toolbar.</seg>
<seg id="2192">This chapter describes the parts of & quantaplus, with which one has to do most. this not only helps increase productivity, but also allows the adaptation of & quantaplus to its own working method.</seg>
<seg id="2193">As mentioned above, toolbars in & quantaplus are designed for the best way using the toolbar. use and addition differ. the addition of toolbars is discussed below in the Adding of Toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The toolbar and the symbols on it can be set using context menu (right-click on the toolbar), in which with New Action, a New toolbar can be created, other actions such as toolbar can be executed, toolbar names or toolbars can be executed, which can be specified in the dialog where the actions on this or other toolbar are to be visible.</seg>
<seg id="2195">By calling the context menu to an action (symbol) on a toolbar, the entries will be removed and actions edited, which are self-explanatory.</seg>
<seg id="2196">The toolbar and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with Settings Toolbars... and set Settings actions..</seg>
<seg id="2197">Templates are in essence document skeletons, code snippets and files for linking. & quantaplus; uses templates basically like a common file system with extended organization and interfaces. you can copy, move, or link any existing directory into the template tree. templates are in & quantaplus; in about the restrictions you set for the file system.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Some templates provided with & quantaplus. provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">Binary templates are usually included in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. more information about the template tree is available.</seg>
<seg id="2200">Documents can be from any text document type. on the basis of these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specific documents are created in appropriate subfolders. it makes a simple framework for the purpose and organizes work in appropriate way to be efficient. some examples may be found in the template tree under global templates. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2201">This kind of templates is useful if you do not want to insert a new document based on a template but the same text area again and again in the documents. you can find everything from a comment on a final grade to a complete menu system based on Javascript or Perl. see for more information on the template tree.</seg>
<seg id="2202">As the name says, these templates serve as templates for whole websites. they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently, there are no examples in & quantaplus.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Create a document structure at will (XML;, & HTML;, DocBook & etc;) and choose File As Template Save As Local Template...</seg>
<seg id="2204">Once this is done, note that (even if it has been saved as a project template) the template is not visible in the project tree. look at the template tree among project templates.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Select text in your document and click File As Template Save choice as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be simply dragged and put on the tree view templates.</seg>
<seg id="2206">The creation of binary templates is simple: copy the file into a template folder. all file management functions can be used for it, such as dragging and dropping or inserting over the Konqueror file tree.</seg>
<seg id="2207">You can click on a folder on the right in the file tree or in the project files to select a folder on the right and secure site template. by default, the project folder will be backed up, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Project templates enable a very target-oriented approach. you can pretend headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; designing, inserting files or linking them with them. in addition, you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects.</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the Template Template is based on the files stored in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / templates and $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of containers as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">To specify the behavior of a folder in the template list, right click on the folder and select Properties from the context menu. the following dialog appears:</seg>
<seg id="2211">A drop-down box with the three types previously described; files, text or templates. this selection is dazzled as soon as parent attributes are enforced.</seg>
<seg id="2212">This is enabled by default and fits everything except the root folders in the template overview. if a root folder is configured to be configured, it would basically deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder, the blah would appear with something like text-tree. if nothing appears, you'll probably find yourself in a root folder.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Allows previous or updated text for templates in this folder. this might be general headers or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying content templates to a folder with special header lines / footers to equip a whole presentation with the matching headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">In addition, you have a context menu (pointing to right mouse button) via a full command file for adding folders or copying and inserting templates from one place to another.</seg>
<seg id="2215">& quantaplus; provides two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor, which can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source text editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source text editor and the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The VPL; editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page and cursor appears. then you can edit and revert if necessary to the source code editor in which the changes made in the VPL; editor are visible in the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2217">When working with the VPL; editor at a document that & PHP; contains, a small green symbol shows the Vohandrite of & PHP; source code. it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL; editor. to edit & PHP; it is still necessary to edit the source code editor. there are no plans to change this behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2218">The second mode works just like the first one, except that simultaneously the changes are visible in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor, and the cursor in the source text editor and in the VPL; editor is activated, this mode is already active, the key pressure is activated from a window to the other, where the position is maintained in the document.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The synchronisation distance between the VPL; editor and the source text editor is configurable via settings Quanta. by choosing VPL, you can choose between synchronization after one click or automatically. in general, the recommendation can be adjusted in addition to the time span. basically, the recommendation is: a small span for fast calculator and a large span for slow.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Assuming you want to change the title of the web page, the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the VPL; editor. the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created with the VPL; editor.</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below. one click on the list allows to change the content, e.g. keywords on the name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way to create pages in your browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is possible exactly as with the Meta elements. editing of CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">The use of the cursor is possible, as in a word processor, by moving the arrows. under rare circumstances, the cursor behaves strangely. the mark works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and deleted by means of a button or remover button.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Inserting tags will be done in the same way using the toolbar editor, as in the source code editor. note that inserting tags previously does not remove existing identical tags e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text, each other surrounding anchor day must be removed.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Some tool lists such as the tables assistant or the list assistant are disabled. they will work later in & VPL; in this release, tables or lists need to be used toolbars.</seg>
<seg id="2227">& xsldbg; is a tool for the study of style sheets. in contrast to other style sheets, the search for certain elements is possible and the style of style can be followed.</seg>
<seg id="2228">To compile & xsldbg; successfully compile, need the libraries libxslt, libexslt and libxml, which are already available at a typical installation of & kde; already available.</seg>
<seg id="2229">New in xsldbg 3.1.4: new in xsldbg 3.1.4: in gdb-compatible mode, orphaned support points can be set in a specific file and line number and later enabled.</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I have written.</seg>
<seg id="2282">The merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions have been added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">For example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it into the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function transformed & kdiff3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other in a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps resolving conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. in this editor you can even edit the result directly.</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge entire folders. this screen shot shows & kdiff3; in folder merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today color monitors. if you often have to check codes, you will like this function.</seg>
<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are displayed visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">If a file is equal, and the other one differs in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different.</seg>
<seg id="2292">If all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease the typing by typing only the file name of the first file. example:</seg>
<seg id="2293">Cdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 kdiff3 folder 1 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">Opening dialog allows you to manually typing file names, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog remembers your selection and displays them again next time. you do not have to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C empty, the analysis of differences with two files is performed.</seg>
<seg id="2295">Using the Folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders is initiated. if a file is selected for A, but for B and C but a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders.</seg>
<seg id="2296">When merging is enabled, the input field is active for target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving.</seg>
<seg id="2297">The set-up button opens a dialog with Settings. here you can set options before you start comparing / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to draw text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in opening dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button.</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">What is the idea behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar to these functions, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two appropriate files, load them in & kdiff3, and then compare them. now you can easily copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Note: at the moment you can extract nothing from & kdiff3; only the drop down of text into a comparison window is supported.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the drag and drop text into another program as cut and paste (instead of copy and paste). in such a case, your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">The info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse take a while above the line. then a small auxiliary window will display the full name.)</seg>
<seg id="2304">The three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed via the settings menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2305">When a difference is detected, one sees the color, which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is especially useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) good to see.</seg>
<seg id="2306">If differences were found, the column displays the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few rare individual cases.)</seg>
<seg id="2307">The vertical line separating the summary column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks is enabled, the line will be dotted with dotted lines.</seg>
<seg id="2308">The result window (among the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription output:, the filename and [Gealters] if you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts.</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the buttons to move to the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">If only two comparators are used, each difference is also a conflict that needs to be solved manually.</seg>
<seg id="2311">By clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the line will be marked in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed. this group will then highlight the current group. it will be highlighted with the color background color for current area and on the left a black bar appears.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manual editing; this is only a placeholder for the event that you change your mind and perhaps select another source again. this text does not appear in the final file, nor in a marker that you may copy and paste elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. go carefully with this function.</seg>
<seg id="2314">Note: if the sources are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments will also be treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, page on, page starting, beginning, end, Ctrl-Start and Ctrl-End, Siw as you can also use it from other programs.</seg>
<seg id="2316">In the output window you can also use the other buttons for editing. by inserting the button you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is insert mode.)</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summary columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">The toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-Picture up / Ctrl-picture down) or to the next / previous unresolved conflict.</seg>
<seg id="2319">To copy the mark to the clipboard, you need to press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). if this is enabled, whatever you mark is automatically copied to the clipboard and eliminating manual copying. however, be careful with this option because you could accidentally overwrite the contents of the clipboard.</seg>
<seg id="2320">Newlines are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use a carriage return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, so you should not use binaries.</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of the recently used files will be saved automatically during loading and restored at the next start. (set up menu Setting &gt; KDiff3...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">Choose a font with a fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also displays fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)</seg>
<seg id="2323">When you activate this option, differences are displayed in italics. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens at all.</seg>
<seg id="2324">On systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form, but would be rendered astert. on these systems, the Preferences button automatically adjusts an odd color.</seg>
<seg id="2325">When this option is checked, the corresponding number of spaces will be inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted.</seg>
<seg id="2326">When you press input or return, the setting of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line.</seg>
<seg id="2327">If this option is checked, each selection will be automatically copied to the clipboard. the manual copy to the clipboard is omitted then.</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which type of line you prefer to save. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">When comparing files & kdiff3; first, find all fully identical lines in the source files. only during this first step white signs can be ignored. the second step compares each line. in this step white signs are not ignored. even when merging white signs are not ignored.</seg>
<seg id="2330">Some editors (on some systems) save a carriage return character '\' at the end of a line, others only store a newline '\'. usually ignored & kdiff3; the carriage return character will be made visible, however, as a white character will be treated. during merging this option must be disabled. in default this option is disabled.</seg>
<seg id="2331">This option is disabled by default. in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated like white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2332">By default this option is disabled. changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2333">Intensely looking for even smaller differences. the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slow with very large files.</seg>
<seg id="2334">In automatic jumping mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection will be displayed before the next unresolved conflict will continue.</seg>
<seg id="2335">Automatically dissolves all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use better the functions Choose A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic selection also applies conflicts in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are dealt with in the chapter on scanning of folders and conducting a merge. look for details on the directory comparison and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">If a file is stored and an older version already exists, then the original version will be appended to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup.</seg>
<seg id="2338">Adjust the language of the user interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to quit and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally over the control centre.)</seg>
<seg id="2339">The following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you enable this option, the upper setting will be used for all entries.</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for the encoding appears a short note on what the local encoding is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">Adjust the file encoding for source files. this affects how special characters are treated and interpreted. as the encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged.</seg>
<seg id="2342">If you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving.</seg>
<seg id="2343">If you define preprocessing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files could be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option one can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands.</seg>
<seg id="2344">Switch this off to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in the text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options ignore numbers or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">This selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode all differences are displayed in a color coded oversight column. however, sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -c; C is displayed next to the normal one second oversight column with the required information.</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen for long lines. just send out the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">Sometimes you see the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as pre-set name for output file. (if this function is used to restart merging, then the name of the last file used will be maintained.)</seg>
<seg id="2349">When reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. in & kdiff3, then the output of the command will be visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. you can use this function e.g. to cut off disruptive parts or to correct the indentation.</seg>
<seg id="2350">When reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command. you can write your own preprocessor which corresponds exactly to your requirements. each entry line must have a corresponding output line.</seg>
<seg id="2351">The idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility when setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program that themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is completely sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2352">Use this preprocessing command for line spacing to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\) /\\ U\\ 1 / 'The\\ 1 in the substitution string refers to the found text in the first string pair. the\\ U converts the found text into capital letters.</seg>
<seg id="2353">CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated strings (info: / cvs / Keyword substitution). all follow the same pattern $keyword:\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _ log\\ _ BAR _\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\\ _ BAR _\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">The ignoring of numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for a further processing command for line spacers. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, i.e. almost extinguished.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the replacements. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something different such as perl -p -e's / regexp / replace / SCHALTER'Allerholdings are different in perl some details. where sed\\ (and\\) requires, perl only needs (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for display and merging. the other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">Note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hidden differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data.</seg>
<seg id="2361">Often programmers need to edit many files in a folder. for this reason, you can compare and merge with & kdiff3; complete folders recursively.</seg>
<seg id="2362">... makes a proposal for each object to merge; you can customize the proposal before the start,</seg>
<seg id="2363">... can simulate merging and displays the simulated changes without actually performing it,</seg>
<seg id="2364">... execute selected actions either with all (F7 key), or only with selected objects (F6 key),</seg>
<seg id="2365">This is very similar to comparing and merging individual files. you only need to specify folder on the command line or in the dialog file.</seg>
<seg id="2366">When three folders merge, folder 1 is used as the base. if no target folder is specified, used & kdiff3; folder 3 as target folder.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Note that only the comparison of folders starts automatically, not the merge. to start the merge, you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F7 key. (see more details.)</seg>
<seg id="2368">While reading the folder, you will be informed about the current progress. if you cancel the scan of the folder, only the files that have been compared will be listed.</seg>
<seg id="2369">When scanning the folder is complete, & kdiff3; a list box with the results on the left side,...</seg>
<seg id="2370">Each file and folder found during the scan is displayed here in a tree. you can select an object with a simple mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2371">The folder structure is usually folded up. you can open a folder by double-clicking on the + / - click on the object or by double clicking the arrow keys for left / right. the folder menu includes two functions All sub-directories and open all sub-directories with which you can open or fold up all folders.</seg>
<seg id="2372">When you double-click a file, the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder (A). these types are possible:</seg>
<seg id="2374">If the file type is different in the other folders then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object. in such a case, the merge action cannot be automatically selected. if the merge operation is started, you will be informed about problems of this type.</seg>
<seg id="2375">As shown in the above picture, the colors red, green, yellow and black are used in the columns A / B / C.</seg>
<seg id="2376">In identical entries the color is identical, even if the age of the entries is different.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Folders are considered to be identical if their entire contents are identical. then folders also have the same color. with folders the age is irrelevant for its color.</seg>
<seg id="2378">The idea of this color scheme is based on dirdiff. the colors reflect the colors of a leaf, which is only green, then yellow and later when it is old, becomes red.</seg>
<seg id="2379">... A and C are identical but not B: copy B (or if B does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2380">... A and B are identical but not C: copy of C (or if C does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2381">... B and C are identical but not A: copy from A (or if A does not exist, delete the target if it exists)</seg>
<seg id="2382">... A, B and C do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2383">... A and B do not have the same type of file (e.g. if a folder and B is a file): error: conflicting file types. as long as such erroneous objects exist, the merge cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2384">The mode to synchronize is active if only two folders and no explicit target folder were specified and if the option of synchronizing directories is active. then select & kdiff3; the necessary action so that both folders are identical. if for an entry...</seg>
<seg id="2385">... A and B exist but are not identical: merge and save the result in both folders. (the user sees as the visible file name for output file only B; directly after merging & kdiff3; B to A.)</seg>
<seg id="2386">When two folders merge and select the New File instead of merge (unsure), then examine & kdiff3; the date of the files and suggests the newer file for copying. if the files are different, but the date is identical. files are different, but the date is identical. if such errors are not eliminated, the merge of the folders cannot be started.</seg>
<seg id="2387">During merge, one file will be processed after the other. you status column shows Fertig when merging was successful, and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred. if merging is completed, you should make a final check and see if the status is all right.</seg>
<seg id="2388">If in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis, KDiff3 will display further columns. these contain the number of unresolved, resolved, non-white and white conflicts. (the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed when three folders are compared or merged.)</seg>
<seg id="2389">You can either merge the currently selected item (file or odds), or all entries at once. if you have selected all the merge actions (also in all subfolders), you can start the merge.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Please note: if you do not specify a destination folder, then in the Three folder merge mode C will be used as a target. B and / or B will be used as a target in synchronizing A and / or B.</seg>
<seg id="2391">If you have selected a destination folder, please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure. there are some options that may be skipped by certain entries. check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises:</seg>
<seg id="2392">To merge all entries: select directory merge / continue in the folder menu or press F7 (the shortcut) to merge only the current record: select Action from the current element or press F6.</seg>
<seg id="2393">If there are still invalid merging actions by conflicting file types, a message appears indicating the incorrect elements. you can then select a valid action for them.</seg>
<seg id="2394">When you merge all entries, a dialog box with the Options dialog appears, simulating and Cancel.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Select Simulate if you want to see what would happen without the really changes made. you will then receive a detailed list of all actions.</seg>
<seg id="2396">& kdiff3; then execute certain actions with all entries. if a manual intervention is necessary (merge a single file), then a merge window opens (note the screen shot).</seg>
<seg id="2397">When you are finished with a file, select / resume directory merge or press F7. if you haven't saved yet, a corresponding dialog appears. then leads & kh3; his work continues with the next entry.</seg>
<seg id="2398">At the end of the list, you will see some error messages that will help you to skip the cause of the problem. if you continue the merge (F7 key), & kdiff3; you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in a different way before proceeding with merging.</seg>
<seg id="2399">If some entries have been merged individually, remember & kdiff3; these entries (in the current session) do not merge them again. even if the merge has been skipped or not saved, these entries are considered as done. only if you change the merge action, these entries will be merged again.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The menu Setting menu of & kDiff3; (Set up menu Setting - &gt; KDiff3...) has now a section called directory merge with these options:</seg>
<seg id="2401">Only files that match the given pattern are displayed in the element tree. multiple patterns can be entered. separate the patterns with a semicolon;. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. (e.g. * .cpp; * .h). the default is *. folders must not match this pattern.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2403">Files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree. it can be entered more than one pattern, use the semicolon; as separator. valid wildcard: '*' and '?'. default is * .orig; * .o.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Ignoring files that would also be ignored by CVS. many autmatically generated files are ignored by CVS. the big advantage is that this can be configured with a .cvsignore file. (see info: / cvs / cvsignore.)</seg>
<seg id="2405">In some file systems, files have a hiding attribute. in other file systems, a previous score marks a file as hidden. this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2406">Links to files: if the option is switched off, symbolic links are compared. if the option is enabled, the files will be compared to which the links show. this is disabled by default.</seg>
<seg id="2407">When the option is switched off, the symbolic links will be compared. if the option is switched on, the links will be treated like normal folders and scanned recursively. (note that if the option is turned on, the links will result in a loop and & kdiff3; crashes.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2408">Performs a complete analysis of each file and displays the statistic columns. (the number of solved, unresolved, non-white and white conflicts.) The full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis, and much slower when applied to files containing no text. (enter a corresponding anti-pattern.)</seg>
<seg id="2409">If you compare large folders to a slow network, it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size. however, this speed advantage will cost you some degree of security. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Similar to the date of change. there is no real comparison. the files are considered identical if they are equal. for example, this can be useful if the modification date has been lost when copying. please use caution. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Enables synchronizing mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified. in this mode, the suggestions for merging are selected so that both folders are identical. also the results of merging files are stored in both folders. this option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2412">If there are differences, the copying of the newer file will be suggested as action instead of merging. (this will be considered insecure because the knowledge assumes that the other file has not been changed.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2413">If a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another, then the original version is renamed and obtains the extension .original If an old backup file with the .orig extension already exists, it will be deleted without further backup. this also affects the normal merge of single files, not just the merge of entire folders. this option is enabled in default.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Normally, the folder merge view is visible during merging individual files; you can move the window divider with the mouse. if you do not want it, you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between directory and text windows between the two views.</seg>
<seg id="2415">You probably prefer to simply compare a file by double-clicking. however, there is also a corresponding menu entry in the folder menu. you can also merge a single file directly without having to start the folder merge. once you save the result, the status will be cleared and the file will not be merged once you run the folder merge.</seg>
<seg id="2416">However, this status is lost if you re-read the directory: directory -Menu: new to read</seg>
<seg id="2417">KDE supports network transparency with the help of KIO slaves. KDE uses this to read files and folders. in this way, you can specify files and folders to open which are located on local or remote hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2418">The first command line compares a local file to an FTP server. the second command line compares a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder.</seg>
<seg id="2419">A URL has a different syntax as local files and folders. a few things should be noted:</seg>
<seg id="2420">A path can be relative and. or.. included. this is not possible with URLs, these are always absolute.</seg>
<seg id="2421">Special characters have to be masked. (# - &gt;% 23, empty character &gt;% 20, etc.). for example, a file named / # foo # has the URL file: /% 23foo% 23.</seg>
<seg id="2422">Sometimes due to the file system on the server, sometimes by the protocol used. it follows a short list of limitations:</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows. then a file will always be accepted as a link destination. (FTP:, sftp:).</seg>
<seg id="2424">There is no way to edit permissions or change dates. therefore, the permissions or modification date deviate from the original. (please refer to the option Trust the size.) (This is only possible with local files.)</seg>
<seg id="2425">The main purpose of use is now as a difference viewer in KDEVELOP. KDEVELOP always starts the built-in difference viewer. to launch KDiff3, press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select Add to KDiff3Part from the context menu.</seg>
<seg id="2426">Normally, & kdiff3; two complete input files. however, if it is used as a knot, it assumes that the input file is a patch file in unified format. then, & kdiff3; the name of the original files must exist. at least one of the two files must exist. then the patch program to recover the missing file.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In the context menu, you can click a patch file and select Preview in - KDiff3Part. please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists. furthermore, this is unreliable if the original files have changed since the patch file was created.</seg>
<seg id="2428">If & kdiff3; as a part executed, it only supports comparisons of two files, a very small toolbar and menu. merging or comparing folders is not supported in KPart mode.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Tools named KDiff and KDiff2 (now called pare) are already available. furthermore, the name KDiff3 already indicates that it can merge like the program diff3 from the diff tool collection.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I have been using GPL programs for a long time and learned a lot by peaking into the sources of other programs. this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this way or are going to go this way.</seg>
<seg id="2431">You compiled the program from the sources and probably didn't tell the configure script to KDE. in default configure configure in / usr / local, but then KDE will not find the resources for the user interfaces (e.g. kdiff3ui.rc). in the README file you will find more information on this topic.</seg>
<seg id="2432">If only the number of white characters is different, these lines are first treated as identical; however, if only a non-white character is different, the line is treated as not identical. iF similar lines of next to each other, this is the dence but this is often the case.</seg>
<seg id="2433">The editor will remember every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends. however, this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The effort was too large so far. you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C. to edit larger quantities of text, another editor should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2435">After removing text is suddenly lt; no src linens; appeared and the text can't be deleted. what does that mean and how can it be removed?</seg>
<seg id="2436">& kdiff3; uses already many colors to highlight differences. even more highlighting would be confusing and missing the purpose. please use another editor for this.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web. thank you!</seg>
<seg id="2438">To use all functions of & kdiff3; you need & kde; 3.1 or newer.</seg>
<seg id="2439">Information on how to use KDiff3 on other platforms without KDE can be found on the homepage.</seg>
<seg id="2440">A list of the last changes can be found under http: / / kdiff3.sourceforge.net / ChangeLog or in the file ChangeLog in the source package.</seg>
<seg id="2441">To compile and install & kdiff3; on a system with & kde; to compile and install, use the following command in the base folder of the & kdiff3; distribution:</seg>
<seg id="2442">KDE-dir returns the folder in your system where KDE is installed. if you are unsure, you will find more details in the README file.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Since & kdiff3; autoconf and automake are used, you should have no problems while compiling. if difficulties arise, please report to the & kde; -Mailing lists thereof.</seg>
<seg id="2444">Cut (Ctrl-X or Shift Remove) copies to the clipboard and deletes the selected text. insert (Ctrl-V or Shift-Insert) inserts the text from the clipboard to the current cursor position resp. replaces the current marker.</seg>
<seg id="2445">Only show differences: files that are identical in all folders will not appear in the folder structure, and consequently not in the destination folder.</seg>
<seg id="2446">(in the current version of the program, you will need to re-read the Update folder after changes to these options.)</seg>
<seg id="2447">There are only entries that show differences. this also leads to the fact that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging. if the destination folder does not already contain these files, they are missing after merging. (the behavior will probably be changed in a later program version.) This option is switched off in default.</seg>
<seg id="2448">Note the buttons to select the source with the label A, B and C below the menu bar. if you click on one of the buttons, the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window (if they are not already available). if the lines are already present, they will be removed when you click on the button.</seg>
<seg id="2449">This option is disabled by default. different characters (such as' A 'and' a ') are treated like differences in white characters.</seg>
<seg id="2450">The & Kpager; shows a thumbnail of all virtual desktops. it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the worktops, change their size, finish them or move them. this works both inside a desktop and at several.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The & Kpager; can display all virtual desktops as well as the applications running in it. applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others.</seg>
<seg id="2452">With the middle mouse button, windows can be moved within & Kpager; the movement is possible both within a desktop and on other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2453">The context menu hinges on where the right mouse button is clicked: if on the empty background by & Kpager; clicked, the context menu only displays the two entries Pager. if clicked, the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries minimise, maximize, on desktop and finish.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Maximizes the application window to the full size of the desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2455">Sends the application to the selected virtual desktop. only appears when clicked on an application.</seg>
<seg id="2456">If this check box is selected, windows can be moved within the & Kpager; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other worktops.</seg>
<seg id="2457">If this field is crossed, the name of the virtual desktops will be displayed in the & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Tick this field leaves the & Kpager; view the numbers of the virtual desktops. if it is selected along with name, the names are provided with ordinal numbers, & eg; 1st desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2459">If this box is crossed, the background of each desktop will also be displayed as background in & Kpager.</seg>
<seg id="2460">When this field is crossed, the running programs are shown as small windows in the & Kpager; otherwise only empty workspaces are displayed to allow them to be selected.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Here the view of the program window is selected. simply shows simple rectangles with the proportions of the program window. icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pixmap displays a small view of the real program window. note: Pixmap is only recommended for very fast systems.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Here the arrangement of the & Kpager; main window can be determined: classically leaves & kpager; in a 2xN grid, as made from pager applications in some other window managers; horizontal shows all virtual desktops in horizontal and vertical in a vertical row, which is very well suited for viewing on the side of the desktop.</seg>
<seg id="2463">The & Kpager; can be used as an alternative to the pager mini program in the control bar. it has the advantage that it can be changed in size, display and move the windows as symbols or with their contents.</seg>
<seg id="2464">Right-click within & Kpager; and then set up selector switch... allows the dialog to appear.</seg>

<seg id="2481">& Kmag; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanded with new functions. it is optimized for use on low-performance computers.</seg>
<seg id="2482">When you & Kmag; start, a window appears as shown above. the main window of & Kmag; shows the enlarged area of the screen. in the following, this window appears as a magnifying window.. The image shown in the magnifying window is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window below.</seg>
<seg id="2483">In default setting & Kmag; the area around the mouse pointer like a moving magnifying glass. alternatively, you can represent a selected screen area in the magnifying window (selection window mode) or the environment of the mouse pointer at the edge of the screen (eg; on the left side of the screen).</seg>
<seg id="2484">If you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window, select the mouse pointer to hide. please note that the mouse pointer is currently not able to recognize the form of the mouse pointer. this is always the default node; / Qt; pointer.</seg>
<seg id="2485">In the selection window mode, you can adjust the selection window to your own needs. you can move it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size. this can be done in the following ways:</seg>
<seg id="2486">Move the cursor in the magnification window and hold the left mouse button pressed, so you can capture and move the contents of the magnification window. this also works with the arrow keys.</seg>
<seg id="2487">If you additionally press the Shift key or press the & MMB; you can move the selection window.</seg>
<seg id="2488">This combination allows you to change the size of the selection window. note that the top left corner of the selection window remains firm and only the bottom right corner is to be moved.</seg>
<seg id="2489">& Kmag; has a lot of functions. you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer, store it in a file, copy it to the clipboard (to insert it later into other applications), rotate the image and more.</seg>

<seg id="2497">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor continues to wait for a while on the same spot. it is meant to help people suffering from RSI syndrome (Repetitive Strain-Injury Syndrome) and those of the mouse click pain.</seg>
<seg id="2498">& kmousetool; emulates a mouse click once the mouse cursor continues for a while at the same point. it is meant to help people who suffer from the repetitive strain Injury (RSI) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain. however, it can emulate the pulling with the mouse. however, this requires a little practice.</seg>
<seg id="2499">& kmousetool; can handle the pain caused by clicking the mouse and helping so many people to use the computer without pain. unfortunately, you may also seek pain caused by the use of your computer. suffer from pain that is related to the use of your computer, if this has not happened yet.</seg>
<seg id="2500">To clarify it again: even if & kmousetool; avoid pain caused by clicking with the mouse, it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse. and as with all ergonomic aids, the result can be different for everyone.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The use of & kmousetool; is simple: & kmousetool; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the motion briefly.</seg>
<seg id="2502">Is the intelligent move activated, makes & kmousetool; a pause after it emulates pressing the mouse button. move the mouse, wait until the end of the motion before releasing the mouse button. in this way, you can drag the drag at pressed mouse button. the intelligent move requires a little practice, but you get used to it quickly.</seg>
<seg id="2503">This dwell time must end after the end of the mouse movement before & kmousetool; execute a mouse click.</seg>
<seg id="2504">If Intelligent Move is enabled, the shooting time (1 / 10 s) is activated. here the time is set, the & kmousetool; after pressing the mouse button wait, before releasing the mouse button again, if there is no moving of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2505">& kmousetool; now supports clicking through mouse shift. if this function activates a slow moving to the left and back, followed by a pause, a click with the right mouse button. a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click. these movements are stored in the file $KDEHOME / share / config / kmousetool _ strokes.txt, but can be changed later.</seg>
<seg id="2506">If the sound is delayed, you can & kde; move to shorten the reaction time. to do this, go to Sound & Multimedia, select Sound System and here the General tab. there is a slider sound buffer that you set at a lower value to shorten the response times.</seg>
<seg id="2507">When this setting is selected, & kmousetool will start; at each start of & kde; started. this function is currently only available at & kde; available. at GNOME or other window environments, please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2508">Reset all settings to the values set when the dialog is opened. if you have already pressed the Apply button, the settings will be reset to the state after the last press of Apply.</seg>
<seg id="2509">Best use & kmousetool; first with the presets. in particular, the intelligent move should be turned off first. if you then get used to the automatic mouse click, you can later push the intelligent move.</seg>
<seg id="2510">If you use the audible click it is necessary to reduce the response times of & kde; for sounds.</seg>
<seg id="2511">First, you should be aware of which places a mouse click remains without effect: clicking on the neutral components of windows or places in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions. you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again.</seg>
<seg id="2512">If your mouse is bucking, you should clean your mouse. that's usually quite simple. the trick here is that you don't just clean the mouse ball but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball.</seg>
<seg id="2513">First you have to remove the mouse ball. as this happens, mouse to mouse is different. but it should be clear if you look at the underside of the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">If you have removed the ball, you'd have to see the rolls. they are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted. the dirt and dirt can easily scrape with a flat blade or finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2515">In very rare situations, the operating system interrupts the execution of & kmousetool; if you use the intelligent move in this case, that means & kmousetool; the operation no longer can stop by releasing the mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="2516">This happens when you & kmousetool; use under another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click. this will reset the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue working as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you enter text, try & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and set the cursor to another place.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Solution: use the mouse to place the cursor to where you want it. but park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop, if you want to make a keyboard input. this way, accidental moving of mouse clicks can cause unwanted reactions. secure zones for the mouse pointer are & eg; the gray areas around the toolbar and menus and the title lines of windows.</seg>
<seg id="2520">I try to work with intelligent push, but I don't manage to edit text.</seg>
<seg id="2521">The intelligent move is an advanced function of & kmousetool; and it takes its time before you can handle it. it is very well possible to select text to copy and paste it into the clipboard, or execute any other action in which you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button. here are some advice on this:</seg>
<seg id="2522">Do not use the intelligent move if you just start using it & kmousetool; instead, select text instead: run a mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key pressed while you move the cursor to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Use the audible mouse-click. thus, each time & kmousetool is played, the mouse button expresses a sound like a mouse click. so you know exactly when the sliding time starts when the intelligent move is moved. later you can use the intelligent move even without the audible mouse click. but it needs some practice.</seg>
<seg id="2524">To be able to use & kmousetool, the XTest extension for & X Window needs to be installed, which should be the case in most systems.</seg>
<seg id="2525">The functionality of the audible mouse clicks is only available if the system has a sound card and speakers and is correctly set up.</seg>
<seg id="2526">& kmousetool; press the mouse button as soon as the mouse cursor moves briefly. this program has been developed for people suffering from RSI syndrome and which prepares the anathetic of the mouse buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2527">& kmousetool; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a drag process to start before the mouse button is released. in this way, drag and drop can also be done with the mouse.</seg>

<seg id="2619">Filter for string replacement provides a good possibility in & ktts; wrongly stressed or flawed messages to correct. it removes the tags br and b from messages sent by mail, and additionally the expression / local / inbox, since it can be assumed in most cases as provided.</seg>
<seg id="2620">Filters are one of the advanced capabilities of & ktts; for normal work with & ktts; filters are not required.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In filters, text is edited before it is sent to the program speech-dispatcher. they are useful for improving pronunciation in order to replace misspoken words or abbreviations, select a suitable language and speaker or to circumvent certain shortcomings of speech synthesizers and their voices.</seg>
<seg id="2622">To understand how filters work, it is important to know how the program "speech-dispatcher" works with a text. & ktts; distinguishes between four types of texts.</seg>
<seg id="2623">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and will hold these orders. if the issue of the screen reader is read, the stopped jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2624">Alerts have the next priority. this stage is important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and plain text. these orders are continued after the issue of warning.</seg>
<seg id="2625">Messages are the next highest priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that uses messages. while you & eg; you can read a long text on a web page, you can go with & kmouth; messages are also messages.</seg>
<seg id="2626">The rest are simple text orders. each order that you send from the card card orders is a text order. KSayit is an example of an application that uses text orders. text orders are intended for the output of longer texts that do not have any special urgency.</seg>
<seg id="2627">All four types of orders are processed in queues except the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one such read, this issue will stop and terminate.</seg>
<seg id="2628">First, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers. they are applied to normal warnings, messages, and text orders as well as on & kde; messages.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future, there may still be other types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">Text boxes replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. text or for formatting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable form.</seg>
<seg id="2632">& XML; reformers use a XSLT file (XML; style Language - Transforms) around & XML; from one format to another format. in the scope of delivery of & ktts; are some XSLT files for translation of & XHTML; included in SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2633">With speaker selection filters you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to & ktts; sent to a speaker. for example, if you have set a female voice on the voice card spokesman, you can read text from KDE messages about it.</seg>
<seg id="2634">Each of these different filters has adjustable rules, according to which it is applied for voice output. if the filter detects that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter.</seg>
<seg id="2635">When a text order, a message, warning or a & kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is processed by all activated filters that have been set up on the bottom. the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2636">This shows the list of normal filters that are set up. if a filter is not checked, it is not activated and is not used. filters are processed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2637">Click here to insert a new filter. select the type of filter and the following setup dialogs will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2638">You will need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative patterns for the setup of string reduction filters. if these patterns are found in the text, then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Enter a name for your filter. you can choose this name arbitrarily, it only needs to be distinguished from the names of the other filters.</seg>
<seg id="2640">This is the list of words and regular expressions. the filter compares the text with the strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Erposit column. the list is processed in the order displayed from top to bottom.</seg>
<seg id="2641">Click here to move the selected word or regular expression in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2642">With these buttons, you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list. download a list from a file, the entries from the file are attached to the existing list.</seg>
<seg id="2643">If a language is entered here, the filter will only be applied if the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here. you can also select multiple languages if you press the Ctrl key while clicking the Ctrl key.</seg>
<seg id="2644">If a value is entered here, the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications. you can enter several programs separated by commas. example: conversation, kmail</seg>
<seg id="2645">The application ID of running programs is provided with the program qdbus;. the & dbus; numbers must be omitted. if for example & qdbus; the application ID copied-3432 shows, you may only enter copies.</seg>
<seg id="2646">The string replace filter will only be applied to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filter apply if identical. if all input fields are empty, the filter will be applied to all texts.</seg>
<seg id="2647">When comparing words, the string replace filter uses regular expressions in the form\\ s word\\. words must therefore be limited to both sides by separators (spaces).</seg>
<seg id="2648">In this manual you will find no manual for writing regular expressions. but if you have the & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can enter it in the dialogs add or edit as help to assemble these expressions.</seg>
<seg id="2649">XML; Transformer translate & XML; with the help of XSLT files from one format to another format. XSLT (XML; Style Language - Transforms) is a W3C standard for such conversions. it can only be applied to well-formed XML. the utility xsltproc must be installed on your system.</seg>
<seg id="2650">Enter the path for the program xsltproc. if xsltproc is accessible via the environment variable PATH, xsltproc is also sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2651">The speaker selection filter allows you to send texts to a specific speaker, which is set up on the voice card speaker, or to a speaker with specific features. for example, you can specify that text from kmail should be read by a female voice.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Before & ktts; if a text is handed over to the filter, it looks for a speaker for the text. the speaker is selected according to the speaker features that the program provides, which sends the text to & ktts; the speaker is selected with the speaker selection filter.</seg>
<seg id="2653">If a value is entered here, the filter will be applied if the text contains the given regular expression. is on your system the & kde; Editor & # 160; for & # 160; for & # 160; Regular & # 160; Expressions installed, you can click on the button to get help when entering.</seg>
<seg id="2654">To achieve a faster processing, you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string, i.e., start the regular expression with &lt;! [CDATA [^]] &gt;.</seg>
<seg id="2655">Specify the characteristics of the speaker you want. if the text meets the filter conditions shown above, the speaker will be selected to meet the desired requirements. click the button on the right to see the dialog box selection.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Use these buttons to store or load your speaker settings or delete all settings.</seg>
<seg id="2657">The speaker selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions with an entry in the box Diesen filter apply if applicable. you must enter at least one condition.</seg>
<seg id="2658">The voice output API, by & kde; with the programmer can give their applications TTS skills. applications communicate with KTTSD via & dbus;.</seg>
<seg id="2659">The KTTSD module API, with the voice synthesizer to be added to KTTSD, so that & ktts; this synthesizer can use.</seg>
<seg id="2660">The following section contains a short description of the & kde; -DBus; interface of the voice output API by & kde; the complete documentation for both APIs will be found on the kde; Accessibility web page (http: / / accessibility.kde.org).</seg>

<seg id="2667">Due to an error in festival 1.95 beta, you must install the (male British) voice rab _ diphone, so that Sable works at all. you also need to do this if you do not use this voice for reading websites. also make sure that the program xsltproc is installed and can be found on the environment variable PATH.</seg>
<seg id="2668">Certain characters or punctuation marks seem to cause errors during the synthesizer, so that whole sentences are skipped or only cowardworm is spent. what can I do about it?</seg>

<seg id="2676">The list of languages mentioned above can be incomplete or obsolete. therefore, consult the description of the synthesizer to the supported languages. also look at the website of ktts;, according to information which are not yet contained in this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2677">The program "speech-dispatcher" uses an adaptable module architecture for voice synthesizers. if you want to expand & ktts; for the use of another synthesizer, contact the developer team.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The xsltproc User Language program is used for the support of SSML and for the XML conversion filter, but it is not mandatory. Debian users can install xsltproc using the apt-get install xsltproc command.</seg>
<seg id="2679">To compile & ktts; to compile, you need a current development environment of KDE (version 3.4 or later), including the kdelibs packages and the development files for the program "speech dispatcher."</seg>
<seg id="2680">If you have the source code of & ktts; refer to the source tree archive for link or download the tarball currently created every night, and install the program with the following commands:</seg>
<seg id="2681">Before using & ktts; first of all, check that your speech synthesizer works correctly with your speech synthesizer. you can use the spd-conf shell script to do this.</seg>
<seg id="2682">& ktts; in & kde; 4.4 is the first version of & ktts; that uses the program speech-dispatcher. the program kttmsgr should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech-dispatcher is possible directly and the script spd-conf is no longer needed.</seg>
<seg id="2683">A long text is decomposed into individual sentences. the user can return set or paragraph style, repeat, pause or cancel the output.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If you give an application text to & ktts, it can specify the characteristics of the preferred speaker for the output. if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and its gender is female, it is used, otherwise the best fitting speaker will be chosen. if you want to know more about how & tts; select a speaker, see in.</seg>
<seg id="2685">When you click Add to add a speaker to the list or click Edit to add a speaker to the list, or click Edit, the tab speaker device will be displayed. as an example, the module for Festival Interactive is shown below. for details on the modules, see below.</seg>
<seg id="2686">Enter the path to the executable festival program. if the path to the festival in PATH is included, you just have to enter the festival.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Select the encoding for text passed to the festival. if voices, the & ktts are known, this setting will be performed automatically. generally, Western languages are used ISO 8859-1, Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 8859-2.</seg>
<seg id="2688">With these sliders you can adjust volume, speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language. if you can't select some controls and display this gray, the voice chosen by you does not allow you to adjust these settings.</seg>
<seg id="2689">Some voices like multi-syn voices require several seconds to be loaded due to their size. if you mark this check box, these voices are already loaded at the start of KTTSD so that (with greater memory consumption) the first set is synthesized faster.</seg>
<seg id="2690">If this check box cannot be selected, you have not yet set up a speaker (or click Apply to Apply). see.</seg>
<seg id="2691">If this check box is selected, the program window is displayed at the start of the ktales mgr. otherwise after the start only the symbol ktales mgr appears in the system section, but not the program window. click on the icon in the system section to display the program window.</seg>
<seg id="2692">If this check box is selected and tmgr runs not yet, it appears in the system area as soon as the KTTSD reads a text. this allows you to pause or otherwise control the reading.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Here are all orders listed in the queue, along with the application that has set the order, the current status of the order, the number of sentences and the straight edited sentence. the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the file card spokesman.</seg>

<seg id="2703">You can set up special actions on this map, which will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority. & ktts; processes four types of language jobs:</seg>
<seg id="2704">The output of screen readers has the highest priority. it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders. once the output of the screen readers has been read, the stopped jobs will be resumed.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Warnings have the next highest priority. this level is reserved to important messages such as & eg; processor is reserved too hot. a warning keeps the output of messages and plain text. these orders are continued after reading the warning.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Messages are the next priority. a message breaks normal text. & kmouth; is an example of an application that pronounces news. if you & eg; just read a long text on a website, you can go with & kmouth; nevertheless, someone who just enters the room.</seg>
<seg id="2707">If a text order is interrupted by a message, warning or output of a screen reader, adds & ktts; the audio output into the queue.</seg>
<seg id="2708">This audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted. if both introductory sound and introductory messages are active, the introductory sound will be played before the introductory message.</seg>
<seg id="2709">The settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders. for messages, warnings and the output of screen readers, there are no special actions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority.</seg>
<seg id="2710">To leave & ktts; read Knottify messages, run ktmgr and click Notifications. the tab card notifications appears.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) is a W3C standard to mark text for voice output. this standard contains brands for controlling voice, speaking speed, volume, gender of voice and pitch. also brands for controlling the pronunciation of for example abbreviations. SSML is part of VoiceXML specification, another W3C standard.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Currently supported & ktts; SSML only partially and only in basic functions. the following limitations are available:</seg>
<seg id="2724">You must install the rab _ diphone voice (British Male) as this is the standard voice that uses the festival in the output of SSML.</seg>
<seg id="2725">If the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100nbsp;%, SSML text is usually spoken very monotonously.</seg>
<seg id="2726">&lt;! [CDATA [&lt;? XML version = "1.0" encoding = "UTF-8"? &gt; &lt;! doctype speak PUBLIC "- / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN" "http: / / W3C / / DTD Synthesis 1.0 / / EN"</seg>
<seg id="2727">There are two types of filters - normal filters and syntax detection filters (SDB filters). thus, & ktts subdivide text into individual sentences. thus, only the first set has to be synthesized, not the entire text order. thus, you can also skip or stop or stop orders on the card card orders, even if the speech synthesizer does not directly support this.</seg>
<seg id="2728">Here you can see the set limit identifiers. at the first start of & ktts; a set limit identifier is set up automatically as a default. you can change its settings or add another set limit identifier, but it is recommended to beginners.</seg>
<seg id="2729">The easiest way to learn how to set up the speaker selection by trying out. switch off the choice of speakers and select text to read. switch on the list of speakers again, change some features and check how the speaker's choice is changed. of course, you need to have more than one speaker set up, otherwise the filter is ineffective.</seg>
<seg id="2730">& ktts; then proceed faster with reading, since only the first set needs to be processed and not the whole text block, which can last very long,</seg>
<seg id="2731">You can then pause or cancel text orders on the card card, even if the voice synthesizer does not support this function.</seg>
<seg id="2732">For these reasons, the normal set limit identifier is automatically set up when you start tmgr for the first time. it cannot be switched off, only removed. change nothing to this filter unless you know what you are doing.</seg>
<seg id="2733">Set limits Recognition filters compare text with a regular expression for typing and add a tabular sign (decimal code 8) to the set limits (tab marks are automatically removed from the text before filtering). note that the default propositional filter retains the character set.</seg>
<seg id="2734">SBD filters will never be applied to & kde; messages (knotify), warnings, messages or the output of screen readers.</seg>
<seg id="2735">If you have removed the normal set limit identifier, you can insert it again by inviting the file standard _ sbdrc contained in & ktts.</seg>
<seg id="2736">On the menu card reader selection, you can overwrite the language settings for the application. the card card is displayed when</seg>
<seg id="2737">Use of the standard speaker (the top on the card holder). in other words: no speaker features are defined.</seg>
<seg id="2738">Use the most appropriate speaker that has all the features of a furnished speaker. if you do not delete or edit the speaker's settings, select & ktts; otherwise select & ktts; the speaker that is most likely to match the originally set features.</seg>
<seg id="2739">Select the method to enter the desired language characteristics by clicking on one of the buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2740">Select the characteristics of the desired speaker here. if this property does not matter, do not enter anything.</seg>
<seg id="2741">Select this check box if the property has priority over other properties. you can also set multiple marks here.</seg>
<seg id="2742">Since the language is a critical factor in understanding the output, it is always treated as a priority feature. you will rarely use this property. the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before, if you know that a particular application will send text in a different language than the one in the working environment.</seg>
<seg id="2743">To use all the features in the area speaker, which is most likely to delete the following, click the default speaker select and then use the speaker that is most likely to meet the following.</seg>
<seg id="2744">In this case, 0 stands for the last text order in the queue. you can also specify a order number. (without order number the input 0 is required).</seg>
<seg id="2745">Ktales mgr immediately crashes when it is started. I have compiled Debug support, but I don't get trackability.</seg>
<seg id="2746">GStreamer is crash and crashed. probably you have to register GStreamer yet. if the problem is not resolved by this, a non-compatible version of GStreamer is probably installed. you can try to update or uninstall GStreamer.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The audio output via ALSA does not work when I play music at the same time with another application. if I receive a text order, freezes & ktts; ein. on the console; appears a message stating: unable to open PCM.</seg>

<seg id="2751">On the audio card audio there is a setting speed. in order for this to work, the program must be installed sox and can be discoverable via the environment variable PATH. some synthesis modules such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed on the card card for speaker devices. depending on the selected voice this is active or inactive.</seg>
<seg id="2752">The subscriber speed settings are ignored when & ktts; & HTML; read. (this is because the HTML is converted into SSML.) Deactivate either the filter for the conversion of & HTML; after & XML; (see) or, if you are quite brave, change the .xsl file of the & HTML; - after-SSML reshaping filter, and set up the speaking speed.</seg>

<seg id="2798">This manual explains the installation and use of & knetwork.conf;, a module for the & kcontrolcenter; which allows managing network interfaces, routing and DNS settings.</seg>
<seg id="2799">The & controlcenter; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings via a unified, integrated interface. the & kcontrolcenter; can be called by selecting K Menu kcontrolcenter.</seg>
<seg id="2800">The & knetwork.conf - package was developed to allow users to manage TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the & knetwork.conf; create a simple interface for the users:</seg>
<seg id="2801">After installation a new module network settings are displayed in the & kcontrolcenter; the network settings module (knetwork.conf;) can be started by selecting kcontrolcenter; Internet & Network Network Setting in & KMenu;</seg>
<seg id="2802">It is important to understand that & knetwork.conf; network hardware cannot install. physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured, so that & knetwork.conf; the device actually displays and allows setting of network properties.</seg>
<seg id="2803">In most cases, drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and installed when installing and installing. if network devices are added later, the drivers must be loaded by adjusting the following files according to the kernel version:</seg>
<seg id="2804">The Network Setting module is loaded when the Network Setting option in & kcontrolcenter; -Index is selected. when the module is started, it attempts to automatically detect the platform used on the system.</seg>
<seg id="2805">If the platform cannot be recognized, the manual selection is offered. it is the platform to choose from the list that best matches the distribution and relay status. by selecting the setting non-re-enquire the definition can be made permanently. at the next start of the network settings, this selection will be set automatically.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Changing the network settings is possible only in system management mode. before, all options are displayed gray, which means the settings can only be viewed, changing is not possible. in the system management mode, you get by clicking the button system management mode at the bottom of the module. it is required to enter the password.</seg>
<seg id="2807">The entire functionality of the module is available in the system management mode. it is divided into three tabs:</seg>
<seg id="2808">The tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system. all available network devices are displayed. the following tasks can be performed by the network interfaces:</seg>
<seg id="2809">The settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface... in the Device Dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2810">By default, only basic TCP / IP settings are available. click the Advanced Settings button to view the dialog with further options.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The automatic mode selects the TCP / IP settings from a DHCP server or BOOTP server. in automatic mode, the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services. the DHCP- or BOOTP server sends all required TCP / IP information for each system start, so no further adjustment is required. in the selective list, either DHCP or BOOTP can be selected according to the system.</seg>
<seg id="2812">The Manually option can be used without DHCP or BOOTP the TCP / IP configuration. in the IP address input field, the desired TCP / IP address must be specified. in the netmask input field, the subnet mask must be specified.</seg>
<seg id="2813">If this setting is selected, the system initializes the network interface on booting. if the initialization is not desired, this option should not be enabled.</seg>
<seg id="2814">The values entered in this dialog are displayed as features of the device in the device list.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used. entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict. ping in the Console, you can determine if the desired address is already in use. in doubt, the network administrator should be asked.</seg>
<seg id="2816">Depending on your needs, network devices can be activated or turned off. switch on an outdated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface...</seg>
<seg id="2817">Depending on your needs, network devices can be activated or turned off. disable an activated network device by selecting from the list and deactivating Interface....</seg>
<seg id="2818">Specifies the host's IP address in the local subnet, which conveys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other subnets.</seg>
<seg id="2819">If there is more than one network interface on the computer, the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located.</seg>
<seg id="2820">A host with DNS support replaces a full domain name by the corresponding IP address. this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses. if the host http: / / www.einedomain.org requests, DNS releases this name in an IP address such as 123.45.678.90.</seg>
<seg id="2821">The name resolution calculator part of the tag name resolution allows easy management of this list. entries can be added, removed or changed. DNS records can be ordered by selecting an entry or downgrading in the list with the Hinds or Herunder buttons.</seg>
<seg id="2822">By clicking the button Add... from the group machine to the name resolution a DNS server can be added. it will be added to the New Name Server dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2823">First, enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button. the entry will then be inserted in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2824">From the group calculator to the name resolution, select an entry and then click the Edit button.... It will display the Edit dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2825">The list of names in particular describes the hostname-to-IP address references for the TCP / IP subsystem. it is used primarily for booting if there are no DNS servers available. in small closed networks, it can replace DNS servers.</seg>
<seg id="2826">Usually, the list of names in particular contains some entries, which support & apos; localhostapos; and some special IPv6 addresses. this still in the test version of IP will replace version 4 in future.</seg>
<seg id="2827">Enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add.... The New Alias dialog will be displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2828">Enter the name of the well-known computer and click Add the Add button. if the known computer has several alias names, press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names.</seg>
<seg id="2829">Select an entry of a name that is known by name from the list and select Edit.... The dialog Unknown Calculator is displayed.</seg>
<seg id="2830">It can be executed one of the following tasks, then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts.</seg>
<seg id="2831">The settings made in the Network settings module are not immediately effective in the system. to activate the changes must be done in a Console; the following command must be set.</seg>
<seg id="2832">The homepage of & knetwork.conf; is http: / / knetworkconf.sourceforge.net, from which you can download the latest version of the source code.</seg>
<seg id="2833">For the installation of binary distributions (usually rpm packages) it is enough if & kde; and Qt are installed.</seg>
<seg id="2834">The installation of the ready-compiled version is recommended for less experienced users. it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a Console; with rpm as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2835">Alternatively, a tool with graphical interface such as kpackage or the installation tool of your distribution can be used.</seg>
<seg id="2836">In this case, the installation of Qt and & kde is sufficient; in addition, the development packages are needed with libraries and others.</seg>
<seg id="2837">This is recommended to experienced users only. however, it is not difficult to compile and knetwork.conf; the following commands should do this.</seg>
<seg id="2838">In the first section of this chapter you will find important information about basic network technology, in the second section all of the configuration files will be discussed by & knetwork.conf.</seg>
<seg id="2839">This section cannot replace further knowledge of IP networks. in this appendix only basic information about the integration of the PC is conveyed into a small (home) network.</seg>
<seg id="2840">IP networks are currently being operated with TCP / IP Version 4 (IPv4). IPv6 has never found widespread distribution. IPv6 is expected to continue in the near future. this is why this description concentrates on the widespread IPv4.</seg>
<seg id="2841">One of the most important information is knowing which IP address of a network interface is. in foreign networks, at & eg; workplace, the network administrator is the contact point, which provides a valid IP address or, if available, can be used DHCP. in any case, the IP address cannot be simply chosen arbitrarily!</seg>
<seg id="2842">When setting up your own small (home) network, the IP address should be selected from a specific area reserved for this purpose to avoid IP address conflicts with the global (Internet) network. the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet, therefore their arbitrary use is possible.</seg>
<seg id="2843">Of course, access to the internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a gateway.</seg>
<seg id="2844">For smaller networks, addresses in the range from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.254 are used. the area is large enough for networks up to 250 machines.</seg>
<seg id="2845">In addition, the netmask is usually set to 255.255.255.0 so that all machines are in the same subnet.</seg>
<seg id="2846">Some addresses are reserved for special things, 0.0eg; .0.0 and 127.0.0.1. the first one is the so-called default route, the second is the loopback address (localhost = the own calculator). the default route is needed for IP forwarding.</seg>
<seg id="2847">The net address 127.0.0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine. normally the address is assigned 127.0.0.1 to an own so-called loopback interface that works like a closed circle.</seg>
<seg id="2848">In this section you will find the configuration files that are affected by & knetwork.conf and where they are stored in the various distributions.</seg>
<seg id="2849">This file is sometimes dynamically changed in DSL connections, so it will not be surprised if in the event of active DSL connections, another content can be found than specified there.</seg>
<seg id="2850">For & SuSE; it is known that this file is dropped by the scripts in SuSEconfig. a different stand than expected can therefore occur.</seg>

<seg id="2893">& kdat; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar. it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape. the first was to create a surface for tar, which additionally provided the ability of dds2tar for fast, selective packaging. the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked: how much longer does it take to secure?</seg>
<seg id="2894">Before a tape can be used, it needs to be mounted by & kdat, which can be done in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2895">& kdat; waits the tape back and reads the pre-tensioning information of the tape. do not recognise & date; if the tape does not appear on the tape, you will be asked if the tape should be formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Recognizes & kdat, the preload, searches for the appropriate index on your disk. if it cannot be found, you will be asked if the tape index should be recreated.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If everything went smoothly, the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated. in the status bar, a corresponding message appears. the contents of the tape can now be searched by flaps of the entry for the tape.</seg>
<seg id="2898">Before throwing the tape, the integration must first be solved. there are three methods to accomplish this:</seg>
<seg id="2899">& dat; by changing the symbol for the tape you see that the integration for the tape has been solved and shows a corresponding message in the status bar. the tape can now be discarded without danger.</seg>
<seg id="2900">Before a tape of & kdat can be used, it must be formatted by & kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2901">A band type must be formatted before you can use to save data. this process does not correspond to formatting at & kdat. if your tape drive needs to be formatted before using it, this must happen before you can format the tape from & date. floppy-tape drives usually require formatting the tape, DAT drives do not.</seg>
<seg id="2902">After entering the band name and the capacity, & date, continue with the format of the tape. all data on the tape is lost! after completing the formatting process, the tape is automatically integrated and is ready to use.</seg>
<seg id="2903">Before you start the backup process, you need to select the files to be secured. this can happen in three ways:</seg>
<seg id="2904">Select a file or folder in the local file tree. it will only backup this file or folder.</seg>
<seg id="2905">Select a backup profile in the tree. only the files specified in the profile are backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Select files in the local file tree with a tick. only the files and / or subfolders will be backed up.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Right-click on the local file tree and select Save...</seg>
<seg id="2908">Once the backup has been initiated, the dialog opens settings for backup. in this dialog you can even check the selected files and change the settings for backup.</seg>
<seg id="2909">If you have confirmed the settings, the backup will appear. the dialog shows the progress of the backup process, including the data rate and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2910">Select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive. only the selected file or folder will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2911">Select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a check. only the selected files and / or subfolders will be checked.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Right-click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Verifier....</seg>
<seg id="2913">Once the test procedure has been started, the dialog will appear for verification. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for verification.</seg>
<seg id="2914">If you have confirmed the settings for verification, the dialog appears. this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Before you can reestablish the restore, the files that should be restored must be marked. this can be done in two ways:</seg>
<seg id="2916">Select a file or folder in one of the archives belonging to the entry for the tape drive. it will only be restored to the selected file or subfolder.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Select the files you want from one of the archives with a check. only the files and / or subfolders will be restored.</seg>
<seg id="2918">Right-click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Restore...</seg>
<seg id="2919">Once the restore process has been started, the dialog will appear for restoration. in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery.</seg>
<seg id="2920">If you have confirmed the settings for restoration, the dialog will appear again. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time.</seg>
<seg id="2921">Sometimes it proves to be necessary to recreate the band index file on the basis of the contents of the tape. this process deletes all existing index files for this tape. you can create the index on two types of the volume:</seg>
<seg id="2922">This creates a security profile with the currently selected files and the default settings. you can make the following settings for a backup profile:</seg>
<seg id="2923">The current working folder where the backup should take place. the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the selected working folder.</seg>
<seg id="2924">For all folders listed under backup files, only the files on the same file system are backed up like the folder. folders that are located on other file systems can be entered separately under backup files. each entry is considered by tar independent of the others.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Perform an incremental backup. to determine which files have changed since the last incremental backup, a snapshot file is used. only the files that have changed since then.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The name of the file used to determine the changes since the last incremental backup.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Deletes the snapshot file before calling tar. this causes all files to be backed up and created a new snapshot file for the next backup.</seg>
<seg id="2928">The functionality of the buttons files & gt; and lt; lt; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation.</seg>
<seg id="2929">The settings can be set up using the menu item KDat... in the Settings menu. you can make the following settings:</seg>
<seg id="2930">The full path to the device file for the tape drive (usually / dev / tape). this path must point to the non-rewinding version of the tape device.</seg>
<seg id="2931">If this setting is active, transmitted & kdat, before the tape is incorporated, the command mt load to the drive. for some drives this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed.</seg>
<seg id="2932">If the option is enabled, & kdat tries to lock the ejector at the tape drive. possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives.</seg>
<seg id="2933">If the option is enabled, it will be automatically disconnected when releasing the & kdat file. do not use this option in floppy disks.</seg>
<seg id="2934">If the option is enabled, tries & kdat to change the hardware block size for the tape drive. not all drives support variable block sizes. no matter if this setting is active or not, you have to communicate the block size for your tape drive.</seg>
<seg id="2935">If & dat; a tape formatted, it writes a file to the beginning of the tape. this file should only show a memory block on the tape. the contents of the file are composed as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2936">(n Byte) The format of this string is the hostname: seconds, where the hostname is the full name of the system on which the tape was formatted. seconds is the number of seconds since the time the tape was formatted.</seg>
<seg id="2937">The band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $HOME / .kdat.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives, which can be managed directly with & GNU; - tar. even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incremental backups.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Check the contents of a tape. this symbol is only active when a band is involved.</seg>
<seg id="2940">& ksystemlog; is a & kde; Viewer for system logs. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files. in addition, & ksystemLog enables experienced users to access information about problems that occur on their server.</seg>
<seg id="2941">& ksystemlog; helps users understand what makes your computer in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system stores the different protocol files.</seg>
<seg id="2942">In addition, & ksystemLog enables experienced users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server. & ksystemlog; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features with which the protocol files of certain programs can be filtered and evaluated.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">Support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">As you can see in the following screenshot, & kesystem log; functions are available with which the individual protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2947">After launching, the main protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open. it will not be displayed to you, and it opens up instead of a small message window, so you do not have to boot with system administrator rights. the log files are usually found under Linux in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually do not have permission to read.</seg>
<seg id="2948">You can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion or by entered string. the list of the log lines is now automatically modified so that only log lines are displayed that match the selected filter. in the default setting, the selection box next to the filter will display the entry Show All. then a log line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included.</seg>
<seg id="2949">You can also select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then matched only with entries in the selected column. for example, in the protocol file system log, select the column process, and in addition, enter the name of a process in the filter bar, so show you & ksystemlog; all log-lines that were sent or created by this process.</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important minutes lines. level errors are shown with a more eye-catching color as minutes lines of the stage hint. the colored display of minutes lines can be switched off setup dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">If you only want to show a certain process (e.g. in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can hide the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the Samba server. in this case, use the filter bar.</seg>
<seg id="2952">In addition, you can activate the Add to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new added minutes lines.</seg>
<seg id="2953">& ksystemlog; allows you to view multiple log files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage additional sub-windows. once you have selected a sub-window, select a protocol to display.</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. you will find more information on the sources of & ksystemlog.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the directory of the & kde; -Subversion archive: kesystem log; im & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">Welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and so named) as & ksysv; this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv.</seg>
<seg id="2957">The system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of the program starts when running the system in the & Linux world. that's why, because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init.</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">The Init binary is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone could try to convert a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and reformatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there if there was one.</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following other folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">Init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically, you need a script for every system service that you want to start when running the system or switching to another run level. system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should be on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run something with the serial port.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one it finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default run level is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">At this point you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can change / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you have messed up, then you come back by rebooting the system and executing the following:</seg>
<seg id="2966">But how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simply: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">This would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be invoked with the argument. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the argument start.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server run level running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user runlevel, the & eg; & kdm;, Network & etc.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer device is simple to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the area of available system services to one of the six runlevels to start it at this level (or stop it).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by pulling it somewhere else. the entry will be removed from its original Runlevel (or its position). this will only happen if they remove an entry from the area of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Note: entries are moved when you drag them into a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you have to explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or from the contextual menu and insert them into the target area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be computed. in such a case, you will need to edit the sort numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service.</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore records that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">You can use the Tab key to activate the different work areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one.</seg>
<seg id="2978">To move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired Runlevel with insert (using Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">To change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the Enter key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the Enter key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes.</seg>
<seg id="2980">Because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed.</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise, they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">I have experimented with standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly new. what can I do?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO prompt linux single and press the Enter key to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default run level to a reasonable value (3 should normally be ok).</seg>
<seg id="2984">I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed.</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution manual.</seg>
<seg id="2986">The way system services are started in these distributions simplifies the configuration of the proprietary setup programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach.</seg>
<seg id="2987">If you are using a different distribution, please check that all configuration files are available, which are needed by the respective system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg, Apache or httpd) just end without message if their configuration files are not available or wrong.</seg>
<seg id="2988">The importance of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using a different distribution, please send me information about the runtime so that they can be added to this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & kuser, it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & kuser; to read.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After you have made changes, you will need to save it. either you can use the corresponding toolbar icon or the Save In the File menu.</seg>
<seg id="2992">The main window consists of two cards, the user group and the usergroup list. to edit, select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry. it appears the dialog user and group properties.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only if you have enabled space limitations (quota) for users, a card card will be created where you can set individual settings. other cards may appear, if shadow passwords or, for example, / etc / master.passwd are installed in BSD Unixes.</seg>
<seg id="2994">The tab card password management appears, if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD UNIX.</seg>
<seg id="2995">This map only appears if for at least one filesystem space constraint (quota) is activated and initialized (recognizable by the file quota user / quota group on the filesystem). here, parameters can be changed for each user, whereby the space limitations are given in KB:</seg>
<seg id="2996">These parameters can be set individually for each filesystem. the current file system is selected by means of the field filesystem with limited space limitation.</seg>
<seg id="2997">The groups of cards are informed about the group affiliations of the selected user. the standard group to which the user belongs, you will find in the Primary Group field. furthermore, the user can be a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field.</seg>
<seg id="2998">The Properties dialog contains a list of all users. to add a user to the group, select this user in the list.</seg>
<seg id="2999">To add a user or group, select Add from the User or Group menu or click the appropriate Add button of the toolbar. editing or deleting the selected user or group will work analog.</seg>
<seg id="3000">With this module, you can install the LILO bootmanager, add, remove and change the boot password, add, remove, change operating systems, remove, modify, and more.</seg>
