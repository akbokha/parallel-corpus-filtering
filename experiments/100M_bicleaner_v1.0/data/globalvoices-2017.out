although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012 , I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extra@@ ordinarily great .
like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , d@@ anced to American music , read American authors and ran their sport .
in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film .
as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican L@@ etter , a fear@@ less repor@@ ter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , uncovered the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil magn@@ ate , who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Constitutional Court with judges who were interested in his interest .
I was caught .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Method Man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was like it was the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admir@@ ation for the US .
I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people .
I even wrote a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and ra@@ cism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
with his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully .
he tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague , and publicly declares his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women .
nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and tuned for him in dro@@ ves .
the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can pre @-@ elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached .
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ?
I couldn &apos;t reconc@@ ile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ ke , director of the journ@@ alism programme , who receives people from all over the world , a deeply beli@@ ever man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past .
also Tr@@ um@@ ps Wel@@ tan@@ schau@@ ung did not agree with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who battles the environment for her lifetime , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like their son .
it still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life .
then there were Andrew Lec@@ ce , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise council has helped me a lot in my career .
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
while Tr@@ ump cleared his way to the nom@@ inees of Republi@@ can presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and counter@@ part to his limited vision of America .
it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule .
on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly wh@@ ites , pres@@ idency of a man , despite - or perhaps precisely because of his cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people .
the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared their ra@@ cism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look those things , almost broke my heart .
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump voters as ra@@ cists .
to classi@@ fy the people , one of my friends said , is exactly what led us to this situation .
this is super@@ ficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
could it be that these voters , of whom most of them know , have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that has disappointed them ?
in other words , would they perhaps say they are still important in this America ?
maybe .
however , it is hard to forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comment@@ ates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t on those who look different from him .
this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( WT ) . : as much as the white against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities ; the white and whi@@ plas@@ h word game , as the great Van Jones mentioned , has exactly what America did so great .
millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have , America is all welcome .
for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan man , whose history as he says himself would not be possible anywhere else in the world .
but with the choice Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge portion of the white Americas on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism .
in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say .
in all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of election .
at a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan .
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; did Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if someone is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; NO &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected .
the country for which his son had fallen , sent him a message .
this is Tr@@ um@@ ps Land , said the news .
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America .
and it breaks my heart to me .

from the misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC .

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
that the music played at both venues not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ...
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town which is very popular with tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine .
for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments .
a music school with 100 students has become a central concern for the church of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its abuse of drugs and ban@@ anas .
but this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope for the youth .
the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , the local press No@@ tici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes :
as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion .
they always come laugh@@ ing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the h@@ ust@@ le you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga .
music from garbage
more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material :
music with re@@ processed instruments composed of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments .
the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all of which were made of tr@@ ash .
the repertoire encompasses classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra and so on .
in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musician of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , rec@@ alls the early days :
first it was very difficult because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children .
this changed as a f@@ avi@@ o something that he had never seen before : a violin made from waste .
today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of re@@ processed material and called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay .
and here they transform it into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can fight illegal fishing successfully
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports specifically about international , practiced solutions for environmental problems .
the re @-@ publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for sharing content .
in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liber@@ ian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa .
the East African countries were so upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts .
Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Moz@@ ambique and the Seych@@ elles were swi@@ f@@ tly mobili@@ zed against the ship . they refused to b@@ ump one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permits .
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ ish@@ eries Authority . he is part of a team who discovered and pursued the ship at that time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to the lo@@ oting of the country &apos;s fish stocks .
the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries founded in 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal F@@ ish@@ eries ) .
in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that then exp@@ elled the prime minister from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like this and work together . they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect . illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions .
due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by means of which certain habitats and types are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance .
but while actions against illegal fishing were once severely ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ dles and through the s@@ nail emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , these actions happen in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform .
there , for example , the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , news about susp@@ icious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection .
fish @-@ i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open seas by means of satellite data .
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas . such susp@@ icious driving routes can also be discovered - such as those suggest@@ ing that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships .
ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal code .
countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports , which means that ships cannot sell their cargo . and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; then there is considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and that &apos;s what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , chief director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultancy firm who advoc@@ ates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i .
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue , which the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network lose every year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish@@ eries , so the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illegal fishermen .
their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , imag@@ inations , fishing protected species , and fishing in nature reserves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they pur@@ pos@@ efully use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non @-@ pat@@ ently organised control system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; previously , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You cannot walk my port &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but another country could say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Come to me &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the closed front has been working so far .
since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of susp@@ icious ships .
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used multiple frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has tra@@ cked and found volati@@ le ships .
due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for the fight against crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it builds a system that aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate susp@@ icious ships more precisely .

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fisher@@ y data and offers technical support for F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites .
Cop@@ eland therefore helps build a system that combines various levels of information with each other . it is intended to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that .
recently Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Organisation : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world by means of the position of each e@@ ye@@ able vessel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gather together with the neighbors to get a better image of who is doing it - that makes sense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that used to be f@@ ished without a license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences now know that they are being watched .
according to Ki@@ il@@ u some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i now have a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses .
after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , inspec@@ tors were there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited .
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2015 , six countries joined forces to go to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also fight illegal fishing , according to exactly the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; Safety is the aim to let more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland .
recently F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state Somalia had its first big triumph : in October Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only the ship was on the road without a licence and were used tow@@ ing nets which are now banned .
the ship was also inv@@ aded into forbidden waters , which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; with taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; says Ber@@ gh .
for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans .

their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TE@@ D Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela continues to spin : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; conqu@@ ering the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s resig@@ nation .

after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition &apos;s request to a referendum on the term of office , Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into empt@@ iness , gathered in the streets .
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the refund of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
the debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including the Bar@@ inas low@@ land area , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira , in the central @-@ north of the Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o federal state and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a .
the political and economic situation of the country is constantly wor@@ sen@@ ing , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute shortage of food and medicine .
many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the holding of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities .
Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows :
as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence rate are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on the removal of many as the only way to reg@@ ain the country &apos;s institutional structures and to close a new government alliance .
the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democ@@ r@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( e.g. : round Table of Democratic Un@@ ity ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly in 2015 . in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the following day and a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government seat , scheduled to continue on 3 November .
the appeal was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows :
it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow National Assembly , Friday coun@@ try@@ wide civil strike and on November 3 all after Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the action programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday 26 October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of the most frequently shared images shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

on Twitter images that tell of confron@@ tations are pil@@ ing up as well as reports of oppression and abuse .
especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own statement .
hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued .
in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira :
the women in T@@ á@@ ch@@ ira do not wear a skir@@ t , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers don &apos;t have !
meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which forms the extent of repression per day :
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s added :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your term of office !
on the road !
others consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and pre@@ fers to make critical voices silent :
they took us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches increasingly increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media that they were too hungry to participate in a strike instead of working or going shopping .

this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z and Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 on D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site .
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities of La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ inian city of Cór@@ doba .
in the course of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process in the province of Cor@@ doba , Qui@@ j@@ ano is now an adult man in the province of Cor@@ doba against his father .
in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship were investigated .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
beginning with the burden of wearing the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough .
for 34 years he retained the family secret .
in the situation at that time , I believed that was all right .
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father .
at that time , I could not see that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer .
Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a police officer . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was deputy commander of the Secret Service Department 141 at La Per@@ la prison .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archive recording .
but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor who is accused of kid@@ n@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kid@@ n@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child .
no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Supreme Court against his own father .
his story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts .
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with an ERP .
pass only that they will not take you one day and I have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for Ej@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina .
so he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base .
he told me that I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had raised me .
at the base of the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners .
these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything .

&apos;@@ There will the prisoners be tor@@ tured &apos;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ rack , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything possible - stood .
all of it was stolen .
he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big cl@@ ump of silver in it .
on that day I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were par@@ ked and chat@@ ted with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I went in and saw a couch that people were tor@@ tured .
she looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable . the other end was fastened to the body of the person who had just been captiv@@ ated there .
they rarely attached a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , over@@ threw him with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 volts into the gen@@ itals .

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty win@@ dle .
years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came from his room .
I immediately recognized the smell and it became clear to me that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I asked myself : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is it possible that a man can hurt another so much suffering ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&apos;@@ i knew that these people were killed &apos;
when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied up with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and became eyel@@ ids .
he spoke with &quot; Chu@@ bi &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra .
in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked men lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
close to the entrance , people stood still on the matt@@ resses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; What do you look like , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me here otherwise ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit , and were put to death by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me about it .
in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rom@@ ero struck and killed a man there . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( according to the survivors , the civilian inspec@@ tor Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera process , charges the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) .
in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , passes through the former torture chambers .
the way you came in here is also the way where the kid@@ n@@ apped came here .
looking at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tor@@ tured for the first time .
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated .
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the dis@@ appearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; boot@@ y &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
at that time at age , I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils &quot; - as they called it - was .
but when I was in the military later , - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or maybe military badge , that is fought against an enemy that has been fought .

but if you go into a house and ste@@ als the fridge , record player , clothing , paintings , money ... then that &apos;s not a boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism .
that is theft .
I have always wonder@@ ed how my father , the leader of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism .
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You who steal cars on the street ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
he explo@@ ded in rage , struck me and cried out :
if you go so far , I &apos;ll find you and kill yourself .
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
so my father was .
I have no single good memory of him .
when I said in the process , I showed a photo from then on which I wore a jacket and a tur@@ k@@ nit@@ wear made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la .
we were not poor but he still brought clothes home .
at that time the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted .
anyway , I was there to testify .
&quot; the dis@@ appearance of the dead is the last atro@@ cious act &quot;
now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se .
I have children . when you first have children , one recognizes the value of a life .
one develops further and realis@@ es that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
well , you executed people during the dictatorship , but why did the bodies disappear ?
why kid@@ nap children ?
one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed .
she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl .
I always asked myself : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ?
they could have simply put them in jail .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people , but why would their bodies disappear ?
did these people not also have families that could be handed over to their mortal rem@@ n@@ ants ?
the dis@@ appearance of the cor@@ p@@ ses is the last atro@@ cious act that one can do to a man .
my father told me when the democracy was re@@ introduced , they brought machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but something remains of course .
&apos;@@ i have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even with the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father .
the thought to show my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I made accus@@ ations of all the atro@@ cities that I had to experience because of him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me why the entire exagger@@ ated patrio@@ tism and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which they allegedly defended were actually good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you have forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can reproach me that I am bi@@ ased . I finally told my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died in May 2015 under house arrest still before the end of the trial .
he was indic@@ ted for 4@@ 16 crimes , including severe , illegal imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 particularly serious cases , torture with subsequent death sentence in five cases and a case of kid@@ n@@ apping of a child under 10 years of age .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the judgment in the Spanish . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 guilty of crimes against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August .
43 Po@@ wers were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court suspended sentence of life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences were sentenced between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als .
eleven of the first 54 def@@ end@@ ants died during the trial .
# La@@ Per@@ la@@ verdict : murder , torture and rape by officials .
all def@@ end@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military members , former police members and civilian personnel .
Pier@@ o De Monti was kid@@ n@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations working for years on justice for the victims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , who formed the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said :
the trial lasted more than three years , but research for it lasted 39 years .
in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government passed the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be erected there , which is now led by human rights organisations .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a translation mistake makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sign with the translation mistake at a centre in Kyoto where you can extend your driving licence .
the photo was spread in the social media .
adaptation of the original pictures by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long their driving license , witnessed a particularly failed translation last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on a shield , the Japanese word has been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be@@ eke@@ eper &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; wron@@ g@@ ly - but perhaps also with mal@@ ignant am@@ bush &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
adaptation of the original pictures by Joshua Lev@@ ine , widely shared in the social media .
the mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers .
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n , published in Kyoto , wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the faulty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; terrible drivers &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , if also gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) .
the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture did not ap@@ olog@@ ise for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the bug was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published .
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the insufficient correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News talked a little more about the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; elderly drivers in Japan and wrote :
the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ ori@@ sts who are nation@@ ally involved in accidents is a cause for concern .
in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 460 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 , which corresponds to a 10 % share .
ten years later , in 2014 , senior citizens created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents .
thus their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % .
while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen in the same period .
in the version of the article published on the Yahoo version of the article , the author , named by name , brought comments to the light , which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese seem to have against older drivers :
the article on Yahoo over the translation error , among other things , received the following comments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble mot@@ ori@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) not the reality ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How wrong is the translation nothing at all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for this bizarre error in English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Andrew .
the reasons for the widespread dis@@ semination of translation errors are manifold .
for transl@@ ating , one needs two important skills : passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language .
the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers .
for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French , not from French into English .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of native speakers who learn Japanese .
some companies who do not have foreign employees do not leave translations internally . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really .
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by mechanical translations show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages .
some of the stran@@ gest British form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints that often decorate t @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styli@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood .

translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations .
in the future , the city of Kyoto has hopefully used a better source for its translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Sur@@ fing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) .
on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broad@@ ca@@ ster Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay .
later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ oli@@ o TV were no longer accessible .
other online transm@@ it@@ ters also recorded recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , which were organized by opposition groups opposing the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
the protests began in the beginning of April after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and had transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself .
Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was tap@@ ed , and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet .
# Zen@@ sur : enable your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezu@@ el@@ an providers have been closed again .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ an users with Internet access , especially in times of turbul@@ ences .
traditional media have been rel@@ uc@@ tant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission considered this as a call for violence .
without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
it &apos;s amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of lem@@ on@@ ade .
the local NGO VE@@ sensi@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings .
previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains error @-@ prone .
if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds correctly or refuses to request such a website .
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the broadcast was suspended on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into custody .
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans more difficult access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country .
in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to get a training
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
today , T@@ ina fights for the rights of children and collects testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ adi@@ s , who became the victims of abuse and discrimination .

the following article is the shortened version of a report of the structural , published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the home again and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
when she was ten years old she began to work as a Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school .
the shop is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their age @-@ old son or her minor daughter to another , weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head .
what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted .
this practice described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations .
after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls .
she spoke with Cri@@ adi@@ tas , especially young girls who were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and den@@ ounced .
she tried to name the things by name , because the feeling of gratitude in@@ oc@@ ulated by the Cri@@ adi@@ a guarantees in general silence .
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains .
on the one hand , the family , who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education , improve their position in society and make &quot; something out of itself , &quot; passes over to another family .
on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with him and justi@@ fies his exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved .
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it many years later .
sometimes they never know about it .
in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , received a face .
when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . shortly thereafter she died .
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military family Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as an official at the registration office .
Mar@@ ín lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón .
at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra defeated Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered le@@ thal injuries .
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela did the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society , responsible for the death of the girl .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a compl@@ ained .
without documents it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case .
they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín might be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court .
everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as labour power , they also live isolated from other girls at their age .
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bik in which her father worked , bank@@ rupt and her father lost his work .
their brothers now had to work all work and began to sell sweets on the street or market in order to make money .
but they all went further to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she stood up every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared breakfast for her employer .
Fri@@ days , for example , cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor .
when the school was over , she went home again and had time for learning .
the more she finished learning , the more free time she had .
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members .
the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , who was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 .
at some evenings the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read edi@@ tori@@ als of opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot;
he tried to convince her to not believe in the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not refra@@ in with her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the master had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they thought I would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would speak back home her native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them .
but she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work .
also at school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discri@@ min@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken is bul@@ lying and the ch@@ ic@@ anes who are exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ ta when they go to school .
because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not one of a group .
&quot; &quot; &quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
society dis@@ appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay .
the group &apos;s administrative coordinator is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or in the district of As@@ unci@@ ón .
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter playing with her in the morning and afternoon .
for learning .

bill of law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
picture of Pix@@ ab@@ ay , changed by Global Vo@@ ices .
posted in Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; sixty @-@ Egyptian MPs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; agreed a bill recently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the regulations regarding the use and use of social networks &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users and users of social media must register in Egypt at a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which is commissioned to make use of citizens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
within six months with adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
if it fails to do this , it could bring a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the bill consisting of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ ated in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent defines social media as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; any application running over the Internet and used to communicate with others by voice , video messages and text . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is uncle@@ ar how the law is passed through when the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are able to impose the registration . it is also uncle@@ ar how they should account for those who do not register considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate regulation at the level of social media companies .
Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , MP and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users were given a username and password by the T@@ elecommunic@@ ations Ministry to get through the fire@@ wall blocking Facebook . &quot;
this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network .
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leading research technologi@@ sts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot; &quot; &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to do with technology .
in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical and private spaces , it could also be done online .
if I take them seriously , it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to filter out citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and also to bring them to a court process .
this is technically not realistic , but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before entering the plenary debate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether its acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , whose senses will maxim@@ ize control and ensure that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the surface , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of .
last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y Par@@ liam@@ entary Council proposed a bill of legislation against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life sentence was intended for those found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; encouraging &quot; to protest .
how a Kur@@ dish nature conserv@@ ation@@ ist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq

high up in the Kur@@ dist@@ an mountains in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal protection worker H@@ ana Ah@@ med Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ards .
a sub@@ species of the le@@ op@@ ards that crosses Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less loo@@ t .
why is this certain kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; Persian Leopard is the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kur@@ dish ecosystem &quot; and the health and flour@@ ishing of the ecosystem also depends on a big pre@@ dat@@ or .
the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy .
as a trained bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show another side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict .
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protected areas are set up for wild animals in the Kur@@ dist@@ an region .

at the beginning of March 2017 , the newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , who was responsible for the northeast of Japan , reached the progress made in the last six years to re@@ build the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; in March 2011 . a massive earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma triggered the catastrophe .
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a fair pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami .
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring coun@@ c@@ ill@@ ors Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated , because ts@@ un@@ ami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map .
the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture also experienced a nuclear accident , and that &apos;s why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone .
from a local point of view , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to re@@ build the life of local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics from the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results for those affected themselves .
the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( be@@ eke@@ eping , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed .
I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent .
nevertheless , one still stri@@ ves to reloc@@ ate for six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ation of accommodation shel@@ ters ( to be@@ eke@@ eping , Kaz@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) into final replacement houses .
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in accommodation shel@@ ters .
in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes .
nearly 40 per cent of the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ated evacu@@ ated after the disaster in accommodation shel@@ ters were res@@ ett@@ led into final houses .
for I@@ w@@ ate , the number is 34 percent .
the status of work and everyday life in the three affected pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures
like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools that were affected by mis@@ fortune have opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures .
six years later , it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
while nearly 100 percent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are in operation again , only 30 percent of the fishing har@@ bours have res@@ um@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agricultural land .
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land cultivated by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma lie in the &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has largely recovered , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far beaten back .
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent on the same level as before mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 percent .
however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal population , it is more difficult to earn their livel@@ ihood .
is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
in order to determine an overall picture , the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacu@@ ates . she questioned her about the status of reconstruction and also how her empire has changed compared to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk .
in her introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains :
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey showed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents think that still not enough in disaster prevention has been done .
how it stands for those who had to evacu@@ ate from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
in her edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed .
almost 63 000 people from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture .
at the beginning of 2016 some more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , have been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent replacement houses .
according to the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture .
in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es most of the evacu@@ ates , who still live in Beh@@ el @-@ shel@@ ters , older than 50 years old , are known to fail because the efforts to re@@ build Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have to compete with massive construction projects . this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo by 2020 .
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
when one encounters people from other countries speaking another language , the differences seem to be greater first than the simil@@ arities .
after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight .
these global links are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small .
in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep pod@@ cast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve .
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders .
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love for music over@@ looks the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations
left : the attack against Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva . photo : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z . publication with permission .
rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely distributed photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week . last Friday , a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia struck him with a bat@@ on against his head . nationwide millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who studies social sciences at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures .
doctors operated him this Saturday and now moved him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer who attacked with a bat@@ on . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás reported that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation .
the pictures show the police officers how he hits Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his bat@@ on on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
if a police officer were beaten by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified .
the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ e@@ dic@@ s ha@@ sten to him .
another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , is also immersed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
for the family of Mat@@ eus who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian re@@ ais ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in hospital .
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus .
against police violence . &quot;
the drawing was shared several times in social networks .
by : Hei@@ tor Vil@@ ela . publication with permission .
on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás :
Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence . here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he was sab@@ ot@@ aging the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools , and here we have sab@@ ot@@ aged a occupied school with a gas leak , and now we have been attacked by a police officer who has been attacked by a police officer who struck him with a bat@@ on .
police hand@@ gri@@ ps
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil in which it came to brutal police operations on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
police officers were at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , g@@ ums and tear gas .
the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , the social and peace party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to reno@@ unce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements .
this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country .
once again , the Brazilian media swe@@ pt street protests by steering the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window disc .
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo specifically reported a broken glass window in order to illustrate their titles in a illustr@@ ative way with a photo .
on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire .
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any form of damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here too the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; receives an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violent acts of the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation with the police . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Vill@@ ages forgotten by the Ent@@ in@@ du@@ str@@ aten@@ ation in Cuba
with the introduction of the Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso law , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors ( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cu@@ ban province of May@@ ab@@ e@@ que , is generally known as the Central - Spanish Su@@ gar Mill , not@@ withstanding that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvesting on the spot .
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
after the harvest , the sugar cane industry in the region stood still , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sm@@ ells of steel and concrete remained .
about 27@@ 2 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
others resig@@ ned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories still grinding .
N@@ ene , a soldier &apos;s veter@@ an , who runs every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep .
he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation after a long in@@ active period because they were obtained .
that was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene rec@@ alls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept .
the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed pl@@ agues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions , and climate change .
in 2016 production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 .
the news would have been a subject of concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore .
why was the Cu@@ ban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically out@@ dated , and they were hardly competitive for the country .
the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes .
they only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
nevertheless , the sugar price rose once more than a decade ago .
from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound must remain , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FA@@ O , the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation .
if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country .
not everything went well
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cu@@ ban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on October 21 , 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training .
the same happened in the sugar cane factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
if N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repe@@ ating is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group .
before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come .
these documents were officially recorded , which differ@@ ed only with regard to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date .
all were signed by U@@ li@@ ses Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal .
from then on , the responsibility was postpon@@ ed and the letters came more and more frequently .
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ continued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he asser@@ ts .
Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another complex , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma .
he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory in whose construction he helped .
with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work .
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important work@@ stations was extingu@@ ished .
in many cases , there were no alternatives for the jobs and services generated in the communities in which they were located .
we will never know if during the M@@ amm@@ ut speech of October 21 , 2002 , the then president saw in the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would go well .
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 , sugar cane is only extracted high through grinding .
( photo : Juli@@ o B@@ ati@@ sta )
after two years , the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed .
when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to imagine it , they also stopped to asp@@ ire the road , this dis@@ advant@@ aged also other farms .
without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to visit other factories .
they became spare parts .
without a future perspective , many young people left the region .
in the area a food factory was created , whose production is not even for the supply of the community .
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work .
forty @-@ nine yields give the old soldiers a pension of two thousand p@@ eso each month , to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a follow@@ er person , nevertheless he for@@ gives the lies he told him .
they tor@@ ment him for ten years .
N@@ ene goes into retirement for 65 years , not because it lacks force , but because it is bitter .

first Nations young@@ sters use hip @-@ hop to express their own culture
recording a song from &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an .
young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do so with hip @-@ hop , thanks to a series of hiking workshops .
as part of the N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances .
the original workshops were conducted by the educ@@ ator David H@@ od@@ ges , who lives in Montreal and worked together in Nord @-@ Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then collabor@@ ated with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars .
the workshop thus increases that the young participants in conversations like &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self @-@ acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind .
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the protagon@@ ists .
because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the State of Neb@@ ras@@ ka .
this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the territory of the K@@ Kit@@ sch@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a street section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered .
the cases were largely unknown .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to medi@@ ate how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation .
many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations .
in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung at Cre@@ e .
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly of the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group who gave them a verse in Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e dialect .
on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we J@@ in@@ an the verse is available in tran@@ scription , as is a translation into English , which is translated into German :
sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me
but I try to continue my days on Earth
this is the day you will hear our cry
because we as a youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
so they can grow and move forward as much as our youth
so they can do what the Creator has decre@@ ed for
in the commentary box , the reader and advoc@@ ate of Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ able ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) :
in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant
&quot; &quot; &quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; food @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant .
in order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( of the food , &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; ) from each dish served in this restaurant .
customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on .
there is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes .
in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a number of small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend transforms them today into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets .
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic trays decorated with plastic rib@@ bons as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge mag@@ nets :
here are a few Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food demand is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case , an aw@@ ning @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) was turned into a mobile support .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile support .
we also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that cap@@ tures your mobile phone :
designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is a great design .
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , ik@@ ura or salmon roe is used , a popular t@@ opping served with white rice .
on Twitter , some users had their doubts :
&quot; &quot; &quot; is there anyone who would say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appe@@ tizing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant .
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
in addition , there are also pad@@ dy balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon .
for more bizarre plastic dishes you can look at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on t@@ witter the h@@ ash@@ tag # for sel@@ ections .
if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry .
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually produced .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; struggle against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; in Mexico , the extre@@ mi@@ sts and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails .
reporting on drugs bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background .
the day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the communities that have learned to live with the pain .
behind every body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed .
this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico sum@@ mon@@ ed the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug traffi@@ cking &quot; ) , telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els .
animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project like this :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
for example , when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and have to drive entire communities for so many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk .
the pain of the victims
&quot; &quot; &quot; a video entitled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how fear lives &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) tells exactly these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for secret tom@@ bs every weekend according to his son .
or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews .
&quot; &quot; &quot; priests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for graves , according to the people we have loved . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13th October he left the house .
on October 15th , he was to be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need training .
there is also my mother , who is here with me as well .
at the moment she has no income .
you are the insurance of my father , but she does not get paid out because they require a death certificate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; where should we get them ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico .
their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs :
I have known illness and sensational journ@@ alism for several years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with images that can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or files from specialists .
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 year old c@@ ousin thinks he wants to be Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he &apos;s great . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets .
for me it &apos;s as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of human beings is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the en@@ forced dis@@ appearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so@@ aring up &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think they are trying to admit that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they do not stir and are still .
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the Capital District : as a family has been sack@@ ed with threats , &quot; she describes how armed criminals were forced to spend money from her business month after month , until they had not only destroyed the business but had torn her family apart .
you think of everything you &apos;ve lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
the pain about it never passes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone .
habits changed , phone numbers also .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
the far@@ ther we are from each other , the better .
she closed her report with the words :
we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kid@@ nap you or kill you .
in these terrible days I asked myself if tears would dissolve my deep rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The For@@ gotten Kids of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of Viol@@ ence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
what is it like to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous town of Mexico ?
he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them .
Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , make potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder .
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared .
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
his childhood was past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ p@@ se of his father , who had been shot by armed men from a passing car .
when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government .
in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor amounted to 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.5 mur@@ ders per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico has launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to show the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug traffi@@ cking , which has tor@@ tured the country over the last four decades in an understandable way .
if a picture is worth a thousand un@@ real words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wik@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this article and the pages to which it is linked contain images on which violence is represented .
the fact @-@ check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a fake .
but how is the year after something has emerged the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist .
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
since its first release , it has been mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar .
this false link between image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria .
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages .
what Happ@@ ened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
in 2010 , a tank car crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , pil@@ ed around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died here .
after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated for years . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with po@@ thol@@ es that were difficult to drive .
tra@@ gically , the tank truck fell victim to the victim .
representatives of the authorities described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ op@@ ed dozens of houses , including a cinema close to people who were full of people who looked at the football world championship .
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were inc@@ iner@@ ated to ignorance .
a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident make up the horri@@ ble scenes of this day .
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people look at them .
but here history does not end .
over the years , the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and wron@@ g@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar .
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically about atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were slaugh@@ tered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a local man to Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many were dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned .
the follow @-@ up time was only shown on the basis of satellite images .
the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army prot@@ ector in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) .
and here the image from the DR Congo resur@@ faced again , as it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris .
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
in fact , this mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014 .
in all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass kill@@ ings .
even one step further forward personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments .
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
according to a flash , published by the United Nations , those who managed to flee were beating pun@@ ches , rape and some dead , some by burning .
while others reported on the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo :
this picture comes from an Arabic @-@ Arab news page that fal@@ sely claimed President Myanmar &apos;s Th@@ ein Being said that monks and politicians would have participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information .
the original contribution , which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here .
other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also wron@@ g@@ ly attributed Th@@ ein to this statement , but had not related the image from the DR Congo .
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false de@@ coupling reach back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; using an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; one can see how far information can cross borders . &quot; &quot; &quot;
an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures under 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo .
they come from a mixed mas@@ h of private pages , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese .
some have passed wrong reports , some have tried to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications .
we have bor@@ dered examples of mis@@ use and linked them to the respective countries on which side they were published . by doing so , we want to show the range more clearly than by language alone .
from the countries listed below ( which were also linked with each other in some cases ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use .
here are some cases that can now be fully sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : News frames .
country examples of false copies of the image from DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false noti@@ fications .
the countries in grey are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are likely to demonstrate fake examples .
as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) .
Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot;

one side that lets rum@@ ors stand up turned into question that the said photograph shows Christians killed by Muslims .
Canada , 2015 .
in this paper , a Que@@ bec City blo@@ gger not only names the false report , but also disc@@ usses the mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in DR Congo and beyond ) .
Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cris@@ ti@@ an@@ os &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn Christians ) .
in this article on explo@@ sions in Northern Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , the district is identified as the Christian part of the village .
La Rep@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where it is not known whether the original report has included the image ) .
France , 2015 .
thunder@@ ous contributions after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one that used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster that refu@@ te this .

Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate . &quot;

this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact @-@ check @-@ site in 2013 and again in 2016 .
Iran , 2012 .
a federation of students of theology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of DR Congo .
Italy , 2015 .
a resident of the Old Town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this message on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
Nigeria , 2012 .
even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo was shared as evidence of the bom@@ bing of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums .
Malaysia , 2015 .
Malaysia offers two extreme examples of mis@@ use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand expressing a tweet that expresses sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are persecuted , deli@@ ri@@ ze , since the photos were mis@@ used .
Myanmar , 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Myanmar government published a position on what it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; news and photos sent by international media , international human rights organisations and governments in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Rich@@ tig@@ ations , which was published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ or molecules that operate H@@ ate Spe@@ ech and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) .
Russia , 2012 . &quot; behavi@@ oral irri@@ gation . &quot; ( Christian@@ opho@@ bia or political pro@@ vocation ? ) .
this post , addressed to the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims who kill Christians .
Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 .
this news page mistakenly maintained that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted to being in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the image is still contained in it .
Spain , 2015 / 2016 .
this article from 2014 about students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , Catholic @-@ related news site An@@ á@@ li@@ sis Digital , has expressly declared that the picture does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it is a &quot; similar d@@ jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the paper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria .
Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ Dün@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) .
the image of the DR Congo fitted with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag and triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris .
they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events that took place in the name of Islam .
USA , 2015 .
the picture was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) , but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context .
instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared with Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do .
Vietnam ( Vietnam@@ ese ) , 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the embassy in which the image from the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos were dist@@ anced .
there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina .
Tin@@ Eye uses other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( on the Gra@@ y folder ) , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China .
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the Web@@ craw@@ ler and occasionally have image file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture might eventually have a correct description , but the original article is not available or accessible .
frames and Pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the mur@@ ders of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison to a European or French life .
to understand religion and the value of human life is important both . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts .
however , a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images .
there are many people with social media who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy .
suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and does the actual horror of what actually happened in DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ?
the distribution of violent images has been deb@@ ated extensively ( for example ) .
one argument is that ref@@ using images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves .
at the same time , there is a concern that violent images are des@@ ensi@@ tizing readers and viewers and taking the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study which investigated how violent media act on helping others ) .
while there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent representations in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting .

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy S@@ imm@@ ons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. insur@@ moun@@ table ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
such words exist in every language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ des ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example Spanish Sob@@ or@@ esa ) .
but all resist persistent every attempt of a simple translation .
a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word .
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages .
for example , in the blog you can find words from Van@@ u@@ atu &apos;s Mw@@ ot@@ lap language , such as :
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - take care of your parents in recognition of how you have been working for you in your younger years .
and words in the Hun@@ s@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil like :
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after you have war@@ med up in the sun during cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they un@@ veil other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity .
sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish even more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are .
speakers of the Treas@@ ure Languages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite speakers here .

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst flood disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and floo@@ ding catastrophe in this decade .
triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually begins at the end of May , the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ alu O@@ ya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country .
after an opinion of the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and scar@@ cely hundreds of people were missed because of the floods and slu@@ dge .
over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations .
the rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly .
the health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in Ta@@ wal@@ ama City with water stands of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
Sri Lanka &apos;s fatal floods ag@@ grav@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on their way .
this morning , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus was in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also floo@@ ded because of the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a .
the Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made for the transportation of emergency supplies for the residents included in their floo@@ ded villages .
various organizations and startups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situations and humanitarian aid .
if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 07@@ 7@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 .
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and vital goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call the number 07@@ 77@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 07@@ 77@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today if you need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster center will be informed .
last year after the disaster of the Ro@@ an@@ u Trop@@ ical Storm , Pick@@ Me launched a &quot; flood control &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations . these were then re@@ directed to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free .
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful bo@@ at@@ rescue operations for people included in floo@@ ding water and land@@ slides .
the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring security and help residents in need .
this has prevented the loss of further human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality .

the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend .
I trust her my four years old daughter , she entru@@ sts me to her children ; she is my rock in the surf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the one minute we call for more slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the next , we will channel rights for trans@@ gender . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are in a sea of umbrellas and humans , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , bound from an American flag , others sc@@ are slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my girl@@ friend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they ab@@ used me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we don &apos;t all look like that .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all plug@@ ged into the same Muslim drawer .
this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who as I do not fit in there , become Muslim .
to be Muslim
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an orthodo@@ x Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
Islam , the Kor@@ an and Prophet Muhammad were the centre of his poetry until the day he died .
but in the western idea , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry .
this clearing makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another consists in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ ising Western books for centuries .
this enti@@ cing ima@@ gery is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the pioneering Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ sec@@ ted the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures still prot@@ ru@@ de today .
our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to ste@@ er them .
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous nar@@ rati@@ ves dominate our news feeds .
this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the USA in 2016 could not even choose their first female presidential candidate .
this narrative fails to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and Saudi @-@ Arab , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a powerful group exercises his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this strong narrative we@@ aken Muslim women who lead movements for change .
it is clear that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were brought to them with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
this narrative has so deep and flaw@@ ed our collective imagination that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children become the target of anti@@ fung@@ al att@@ acking and ch@@ ic@@ an@@ ings .
because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is today not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; other . &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create nar@@ rations which help us to understand the world .
and my industry is f@@ abul@@ ously failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims form the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ speaking Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation coming from 77 countries .
the parents of the author in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
my mother placed her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan .
at that time Khan &apos;s sky@@ lines were emerging , my parents were absolutely Muslims and Americans .
but am I now un@@ forced Muslim and American ?
sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of extrac@@ ting my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ bag , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I joke , we do not carry all the bags with us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam .
these lies are produced by a well @-@ lubric@@ ated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for fal@@ seh@@ ood , which have manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is .
because of the stories we tell and because of the way in which we tell her , Islam hos@@ tility is more than just a stranger who breaks down the head@@ sc@@ arf .
or as the frigh@@ tening map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below .
screen@@ shot of the AC@@ L@@ U website .
Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our belonging .
it attacks our identity , which is so widespread , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer .

I would like to explain this .
I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York .
when social scientists describe religious life , they refer to the following terms : faith , behaviour and affili@@ ation .
my Muslim belief and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there .
perhaps my girl@@ friend , my neighbour , my rock in the surf , would see that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses .
she would see the all @-@ ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter when I kept her silent in my arms and her Arab se@@ duction to protect the Kor@@ an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s .
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one can see , and the evil one cannot see . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my Muslim belief may not always be visible , but my Muslim membership is always part of my shadow .
the grand@@ mother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana contest in Kar@@ achi , pos@@ ing with her sisters some@@ time in the 1960s .
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grand@@ mother on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as she has been winning a competition for art of flower arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades .
it is the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted S@@ uf@@ i @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;@@ an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze .
being Muslims means speaking the prayers she had told me to speak when I have a bad day .
to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord .
for a people who - for centuries - colon@@ ized by an Empire , which a company founded with the name of Ven@@ erable Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dia @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord .
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cri@@ es .
in between , while he writes books on modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana J@@ aan was forced to cry out to his family in India , K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he was not allowed to close in half a century .
belonging to them is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by colon@@ ists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk .
to be Muslims means knowing that over the last two centuries , Europeans have all &quot; colon@@ ized &quot; all the way to four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was thrown off over a Muslim land a century ago .
it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grand@@ mother , an Indian , ash@@ mir under@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mos@@ que in England .
before there were planes , he traveled into more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice .

belonging to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ established history .
it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops spread across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , had gone to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist .
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim is to know that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
it means knowing that when a tragedy visits the United States and the suspect carries a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in .
it means knowing that four hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called Bil@@ al by a liber@@ ated black slave .
it means knowing that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought into this country .
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim B@@ an .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
being an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist , signi@@ fies the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple stro@@ kes , but to fail to communicate it to others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion holds more possibilities than a cube , but is portra@@ yed in the reducing doubt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be a mother means to care for my child and to all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people establish structural Islam hos@@ tility on this tw@@ inkl@@ ing .
structural Islam hos@@ tility exists in the Muslim registri@@ es that began with President Bush and wi@@ dened under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officers who take up a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it exists in a country which exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries bom@@ bing it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that largely reflects Arabs and Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs we reject on Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today .
in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists of the Nor@@ th@@ western University participants showed a scientifically in@@ accurate image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution .
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to guide
we are too deep to quote the Muslim or the &quot; other . &quot;
we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears and the flaw@@ ed and dangerous bil@@ ing@@ ual prints we are getting in our news editorial offices .
at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history .
the Pod@@ cast Sea Som@@ e@@ thing , S@@ ay Som@@ e@@ thing from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ awi ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Sch@@ ust@@ ers Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to attract more Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super @-@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope .
screen@@ shots of media initiatives that want to show the complexity and inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of Muslim American life .
col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global point of time in which we are in .
and this moment has consequences beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is a reason that conspiracy the@@ ori@@ sts who existed in the dark corners of the Internet now lead to the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally , because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq .
I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now , but who today made me an ir@@ repres@@ sible Muslim .
things I left here like a bread@@ cr@@ umb line in my speech .
things that might aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity , a story may l@@ ur@@ k where someone is made &quot; another . &quot;
right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations are held at the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
more than a hundred ac@@ adem@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other , &quot; &quot; structural ra@@ cism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;
but these are not terms with which we usually throw ourselves in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars will be led and people will be enth@@ r@@ alled by creating the &quot; other &quot; in the public presentation , four decades ago became a scientist of Stan@@ ford .
we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of what my girl@@ friend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he bom@@ bed already broken countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion .
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
stor@@ y@@ telling stories , by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 .
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer .
global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog .
here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities .
in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has had events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there .
the following applies to the makers of the project :
the mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong to .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listening is often associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; uses these events instead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , feel , tie . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this format , stor@@ y@@ t@@ ellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English .
even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller , their dedication and presentation lead to the audience being listened to .
they evo@@ ke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier .
the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ y@@ t@@ eller Ras@@ si@@ met@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country .
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the h@@ are and the bab@@ oon in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; &quot; &quot; after explaining the importance of his parable , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot; &quot; &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organizers hope to extend this . all those who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own stor@@ y@@ telling shows .
Puerto Rico calls for the United States to re@@ establish public debt
with the aim of re@@ viewing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017 . the march started at the pu@@ er@@ torial Capit@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and went up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old city of San Juan .
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ ud@@ ad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the ne@@ ural examination of debts ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Rico .
the advoc@@ ates of the renewal of the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States .
this is their claim :
the people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians , bank@@ ers and government officials responsible for debt are being held accoun@@ table for their corruption .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call for a financial audit and a Ste@@ ering Committee without any personal interests in public debts , with a fixed remuneration that acts in favour of the economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are pressed and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt which is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconc@@ ile themselves with sin@@ king pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not in the US sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
hence the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority .
these are their reasons :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Rico requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; measures imposed on the outside will be je@@ op@@ ardis@@ ed without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the demonstration carried the name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; night watch for light and truth &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here are some impressions :

the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year .
but he is not forgotten .
more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has provided for an open network .
at this year &apos;s re : Publi@@ ca , the annual conference on digital culture aimed at Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign was dedicated .
Mé@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ na@@ y , a scientist of the resident CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book Spr@@ ints , a publisher of books produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book Spr@@ ints &apos; , read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Coll@@ ective In@@ quiry ( The cost of freedom : a collective re@@ research ) .
the book published last year and is freely available here contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression .
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it means :
this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the real cost to which this is connected .
activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences .
this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 .
his name was deleted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015 .
since then , we have no information on its current state or where@@ ab@@ outs .
the introduc@@ tory part of his book , entitled &quot; Coll@@ ective Mem@@ ories , &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom .
seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own fate , actions and decisions .
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme convic@@ tions ?
the web developer for open source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , to an unknown place .
his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; Military Police of Bass@@ el had taken the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tri@@ bunal in his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12 , 2015 who presented themselves as an insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
however , his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding the access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria .
Bar@@ ry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and at the moment the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book :
perhaps none of the bas@@ sels was more pro@@ vision@@ ary than the work he began with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras .
Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations and here mer@@ ges Greek and Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences .
Bass@@ el could not know at that time that ten years after he began this work , the IS would put everything on it - this architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world .
this strip in digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be in@@ valuable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not close this project so far .
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison :
I spent my entire life with dre@@ aming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her .
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail .
I have learned to read , write and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English .
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
he also taught other prisoners , how they use computers , at least theore@@ tically , without actually having them in their hands .
G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a sample letter she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail .
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book for a year .
she s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; here is an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It happens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
it happens every time you visit ,
that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes ,
that I lose the reflection at the moment when we embrace
that each of the dangers doesn &apos;t matter to me ,
each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kl@@ es and guards
I forget the j@@ ails of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
that I carry with passion with me ,
when your eyes say good@@ bye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my sol@@ itude ,
to rec@@ laim all the moments ,
and to we@@ ep and smile at your absence .
I convince myself that I will return soon ...

and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 6@@ 5.000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) .
those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
by 2016 , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today , we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Moz@@ ambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted Director after release again on previous post
in anger , Moz@@ ambique re@@ acted to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed .
this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other def@@ end@@ ants due to em@@ be@@ zz@@ lement of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al .
the money came from public funds from Moz@@ ambique airports , their advice to Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 .
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately demanded his return to the company , which took place on 19 April .
in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to res@@ ume its old post , as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention .
however , many people don &apos;t like the action well .
the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ bli@@ ca , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have instit@@ uted a disciplinary procedure against the infrin@@ gement .
the company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambique social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ war@@ dly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;
if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had dinner .
he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image .
but as he is in@@ competent , he cons@@ ented to become re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to cause damage .
consequently it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is liked to pay for his silence .
re@@ voc@@ ally !
Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Moz@@ ambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not possess any mor@@ als :
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him I cannot believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already so mas@@ sively insul@@ ted the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself in the state .
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence .
hon@@ estly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded .
Fran@@ c@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te pre@@ fers to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remember that a th@@ ief is in jail .
thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el not only to remain in memory of the Moz@@ ambique , but also as a keen , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of his most famous oral representations , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious man is capable of anything , also the fa@@ ther@@ land for his ambi@@ tions to sell his own individual interest . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man is changing , my experience shows that he is not like that . he changes the tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; an ambitious human being is criminal at the same time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in Twitter , the reactions were also negative :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its . &quot; &quot; &quot;

according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network picked up their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adj@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; en@@ be@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements gave the word an extremely depreci@@ ating conn@@ ot@@ ation .
in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as a hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar .
but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may normally be associated with ra@@ cism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use .
in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basically different mean@@ ings , which have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; .
for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ inters ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) .
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ f@@ utz@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way if they knew how he could ease his back pain by making a pu@@ n .
the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different .
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is convinced that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extingu@@ ishes all posts that were suspected of ra@@ cism .
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
the automati@@ sm will not understand what you write on Facebook .
what should be done instead , is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the next words .
for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot;
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circum@@ cise their nation@@ alism .
while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who wants to spread hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long .
the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views .
the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network :
... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked .
iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; did not meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post , the author told his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example , the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice :
Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce ra@@ cism in Burma through its platform , but it doesn &apos;t work like that .
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred among the different communities .
in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; fa@@ ec@@ es &quot; or &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry . &quot;
even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wron@@ g@@ ly deleted posts .
if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of revenue , that would be great .
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net .
here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech but were still removed :
used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film . &quot; &quot; &quot;
just to try out whether Facebook is removing the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the post states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
screen@@ shot , used with permission .
over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased .
among other things , hate speech in social networks is to fuel violence in the congregations in Myanmar in addition , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to escape .
Facebook was critici@@ zed for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running to look at the context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them .
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the children &apos;s marriage
a wedding ring in the sand .
photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 .
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice , so that the marriage @-@ capable age is now 18 .
prior to this change in the law , some members of Hin@@ du and Muslim religious communities were held in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ tri@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organisation ( I@@ RO ) , a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere with it , as it does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors as , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defined every man under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
statistics from the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , who were married to 15 , were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 were 8.1 percent .
in 2011 , the statistical central office of the country confirmed that between 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 .
online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which endeav@@ oured to aboli@@ sh law on children &apos;s marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result .
nevertheless , not everything went smoothly .
a Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns to say to the critics of the children &apos;s marriage , that they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this virtually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law at all .
but in the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children &apos;s marriage - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which re@@ posted Les@@ lie @-@ An@@ n Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Sen@@ ator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted by 35 votes in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and none of them voted against it .
after being decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law .
the majority of social media users were thr@@ illed , because the laws on children &apos;s marriage were finally changed .
Facebook member , Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial post in the Ministry of Education , said :
it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has veiled the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e @-@ to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is worth almost every price .
while Abel was the opinion , it took me long enough to aboli@@ sh the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come :
public Status Update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news !
the law of marriage has been decre@@ ed .
minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 on the other hand ! ! ! ! &quot;
torture Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was :
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
the draft for the modification of the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 .
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties who were against have voted in favour of the law .
the to@@ dd@@ lers are legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ like tur@@ ret .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj , therefore , the Secretary @-@ General of the San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organisation of the country .
months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to have fulfilled his promise .
during the At@@ tor@@ ney General of Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said it was quite legal if Mahar@@ aj wanted to go against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject differently .
Patricia Wor@@ m@@ l suggested :
dear Sat , if we , instead of discussing the discussion as universally , in a way that can only evo@@ ke panic and arro@@ gan@@ ce , if we would say instead of talking about the problem that the state , our daughters from it protects them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are compared to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ?
or do you think it is not a problem ?
but whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm , even though there are laws that prohi@@ bit them .

screen print of the message posted on Sunday early on the website of the Prosecutor of Y@@ ar@@ osla@@ v@@ l district .
on the eve of the national demonstrations against corruption that coinci@@ ded with the day of Russia - the Russian National Day , the website of the prosec@@ utor was h@@ ack@@ ed by Y@@ ar@@ osla@@ v@@ l district . h@@ ack@@ ers left a wit@@ ty message . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers posted the YouTube video &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He is not a Dim@@ on for you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the website of the prosec@@ utor with the following comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Office of the Prosecutor calls on citizens not to follow pro@@ voc@@ ations and keep away from all un@@ sanc@@ tioned events ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at 11.@@ 15 the news was removed from the page - but in the cache it remained .
it is # hon@@ estly gone
on Sunday morning the office of the prosec@@ utor informed the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were h@@ ack@@ ed .
by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content
the Wikipedia page was published on January 18 , 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A Copyright Law in the USA .
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia based on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle .
day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and repor@@ ters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the closure .
although many technology @-@ sav@@ vy Internet users are used to use b@@ ypass tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category .
although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently announced in a published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted .
in China , Turkey is the second most well @-@ known country in the world , when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia .
while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated ) .
a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentr@@ alized pe@@ er @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network , which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult .
the content is available in spite of legal prohibition .
in a blo@@ g@@ post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts :
after listening to the news ( about the block of Wikipedia ) , we put everything in place to take sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the contents on a decentr@@ alized and distributed manner .
this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ org .
IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently from the Wik@@ im@@ edia @-@ Foundation , and it is only screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website .
however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock .
Cris@@ tian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedi@@ .org , a m@@ irr@@ or@@ seite between Wikipedia , and Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar m@@ irr@@ or@@ pages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia .
Con@@ son@@ ni told Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as collabor@@ ators with Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; Pod@@ cast :
it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror .
one attacks another URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
essentially , the server will forward the request to the right Wikipedia page , so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself when locked in Turkey .
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature protection
a su@@ h@@ len@@ der N@@ ash@@ orn , Ch@@ it@@ wan .
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poor@@ ly positioned motifs and well @-@ balanced colours .
this motivated him to wear a camera and try to stra@@ igh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was a child .
today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar , Nep@@ al@@ ese , stri@@ ves to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese animals to the international scene .
and his hom@@ etown next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park gives him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife .
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location helps him in his work :
I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could better give for a passionate wildlife photographer ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
my father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the le@@ op@@ ard was , and I immediately began to kne@@ el pictures ! !
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look .
and he should know it , for he stood by face to Tig@@ ers face to face :
a tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleep time for all animals and birds .
also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when suddenly the King of the Bu@@ ck appeared . he sat down immediately , we look at him and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! !

this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India .
a revised version has been re@@ published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
in many parts of India , women have the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as fear of the consequences should they dis@@ regard the norm .
last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted by the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a fake court and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with names .
the tradition of not nam@@ ing their wives by names is also common among men . however , they have much less justification to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice .
in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city .
it is a place for them alone , where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
as one of 56 clubs , which is present in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is operated by the community of Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the patri@@ archy .
Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the disclosure of practices , such as child marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and manages these clubs .
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video , which Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who do not call her hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which the women can easily identify .
not to pron@@ ounce the names of her hus@@ bands , is a custom that they have all du@@ ly held guilty and never questioned .
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not stop this is regarded as a dec@@ eit@@ ful woman , as a woman without morality .
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion .
at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name , wanted to try out at home , as it is running .
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name .
with this confidence in the luggage Roh@@ ini started their first discussion club .
many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some thought it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected .
at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection , the women tried to put the discussion in motion with an exercise .
Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the names of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us what they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; should it not be equal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ste from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on breaking a centuries @-@ old tradition in which married women should never be able to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
a woman was so shy that she knew only before herself during the whole exercise ; another decided to release the whole frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by dam@@ ning him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
still in adren@@ aline rush about having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their hus@@ bands by name .
and they kept their word .
in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports .
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake .
&quot; &quot; &quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in violence .
Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead that shows the Eh@@ est@@ atus :
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red point if he did it also .
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing him .
the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days .
for many women , the disc@@ us club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make an excursion at each discussion club . &quot; &quot; &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives ; they d@@ anced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never said so hon@@ estly about some things , for example how our identi@@ ties are attached to our hus@@ bands .
it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur .
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have borne only Sar@@ is since their marriage .
for most , that &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ sa cor@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants , they did not dare .
after much discussion and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code , mor@@ als combined with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini sne@@ ered her own pair of cur@@ es ( upper shirts ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them .
next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it .
Roh@@ ini confirms the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly :
so far we have only made small steps .
some women tried it a few times but then stopped telling the name of her husband .
some , including me , make it even , but only when they are alone and there are no other family members .
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing zinc red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the disc@@ us club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the catch for more freedom of movement or their own dress @-@ choice - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat .
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am also .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we all sit in the same boat .

the first Japan visit of the popular band The Beat@@ les is celebrated with a commem@@ oration day
the Beat@@ les in their landing in Japan .
screen@@ shot from the official Beat@@ les YouTube channel .
on June 29th this year , the h@@ ash@@ tag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend , where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beat@@ les .
the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ iko , who exclusively inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit :
for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through .
the people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many well @-@ known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review .
good morning ! for today the Beat@@ les memorial day is in Japan . for the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo .
even today , songs from the Beat@@ les are sung in Japanese Kar@@ aoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools .
the kit@@ sch of the Beat@@ les survi@@ ves everything .
today Beat@@ les memorial day is .
we all love Beat@@ les in our house .
I don &apos;t know if this &quot; W@@ inn@@ ie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll should represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the familiar places associated with the band .
if you love the Beat@@ les , that &apos;s your 5 places you absolutely have to visit .
1 ) Abbey Road
2 ) Matthew Street ( in Liverpool )
3 ) Stra@@ w@@ berry Fields ( New York Memorial )
4 ) P@@ enny Lan@@ e
5 ) ( from the link ) The Beat@@ les Story ( Museum ) , Liverpool
pilgri@@ ma@@ ges can sometimes not be bizarre enough :
good morning together .
today Beat@@ les memorial day is .
exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time .
the characters from the film K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year .
and of course some companies use the fan base in the market , like this R@@ amen Shop ( Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo .
good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! the day is Beat@@ les memorial day .
and what could this be for a day ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will listen to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Y@@ ester@@ day &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today and eat R@@ amen no@@ od@@ les at Mut@@ aro Ko@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is how the day is going to run today .
so , we hope you are here !

bald men are de@@ ported and killed in Moz@@ ambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that smart men could be the target of attacks in Moz@@ ambique .

a new system of kid@@ n@@ apping of bald people for organ traffi@@ cking , probably for super@@ sti@@ tious purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambique . the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice .
at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi .
one of the victims had been de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs were removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently used to be used by the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi .
there is a local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring rich@@ ness , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC stated .
it is the first time successive attacks on smart men have been registered in Moz@@ ambique .
another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , is humans with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to a mission to investigate this practice in the South African country in 2016 .
the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce .
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to travel to the country :
respect to bald men who travel to Moz@@ ambique are the goal of ritual attacks , the Moz@@ ambique Police warned of the latest assass@@ inations of three men of the world because of their body parts .
two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the mur@@ ders took place .
Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the town of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Moz@@ ambique , said that local police are already following the case :
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for probably super@@ sti@@ tious rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth .
in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country .
on Facebook Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ anth@@ a shared the chron@@ ic@@ le of the B@@ log@@ gers poor S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Moz@@ ambique :
I M@@ Ö@@ CH@@ TE GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mo@@ ambi@@ k , DAS S@@ ME is ashamed of a country in which people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , and even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where people would not viol@@ ate honest pursu@@ its or even take their lives to get their bread , a country in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor bald or bald for dis@@ belief or &quot; black magic . &quot;
despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mak@@ ab@@ ren hum@@ our .
Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambique and enthusiastic Twitter pay@@ er twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro S@@ app@@ let , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both gl@@ amor@@ ous :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambique authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; bald people &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

a pioneer of Creative Comm@@ ons in Syria , actively in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding the public &apos;s access to the Internet and Open Knowledge .
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and took part in our meeting of Arab blo@@ ggers in 2009 .
in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were herself an insi@@ ders of the Assad government .
they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information .
Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( August 01 , 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials found out that he was executed in 2015 .
today and in the future , we pay tribute to the work of Bass@@ el as a pioneer in the open web movement .
and we appreciate the efforts of all the people and organisations that have worked in the last five years for his release .
since 2011 and the beginning of protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , such as the Syrian Network for Human Rights .
countless of those arrested or forced by the regime are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions .
between 2011 and 2016 less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have come to death in custody , the international human rights organisation Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the fate of many people remains unknown .

free Bass@@ el : N@@ eti@@ zen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was admitted to hospital for cancer of the liver .
in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion , &quot; after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o called for democratic reforms in China .
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Li@@ us case as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an internal matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , China still receives calls from the international community to release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad .
while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing others have completely wi@@ ped out the issue .
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations with United Nations
Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u .
however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated .
Norway in Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ u &apos;s release .
the relationship between China and Norway came to a stand@@ still after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision .
diplomatic relations were res@@ um@@ ed only in December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to res@@ ume the exports to China , as exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for un@@ conditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo .
due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price .
during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants .
the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as she shared in a statement on June 30 :
at the same time , we expect China to lift up all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members .
they will be able to meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world .
USA in the United States
&quot; &quot; &quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad , in so far as it helps him in his recovery . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced on June 27 that the news agency AF@@ P announced that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the call of the US embassy drew a fur@@ ious response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the State Department that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley informed that China should offer the following :
protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice on which it claims according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations .
the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to un@@ condi@@ tionally release Li@@ u and his wife .
I urge China to un@@ condi@@ tionally release the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o so that he can enter into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany and Germany
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the medical support he needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Chinese President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters that China had great concerns as to whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg .
Canada - Canada
on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family .
Li@@ us Ad@@ voc@@ ate previously told AF@@ P that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervis@@ e the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak and contact with somebody outside , including his lawyers .
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Canada calls on China to preserve its international human rights commitments , including freedom of expression , and freedom of interference for the exercise of these rights . &quot; &quot; &quot;
France and France
France &apos;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on 29 June :
all the necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments it needs , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him .
although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive it .
Taiwan University of Taiwan
the Council of the mainland matters in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Li@@ u and to show greater tolerance to those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development .
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu M@@ ei @-@ n@@ u of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ailing intellectual le@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very worried about Li@@ u in an explanation on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us &apos;s well @-@ being .
he said about Li@@ u :
it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world .
I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , who signed charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China .
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid , as Singapore is recognized at international level as an independent state .
but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
this re@@ mark triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries .
he supports Singapore as a city to be considered .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian pursuit of power in Singapore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country , one hears that we are ultimately no country .
it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty .
Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ?
the reasons led by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of it , he inevitably appeared un@@ democratic .
on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party .
these cities are democratic .
as soon as one reaches the core of the subject , the good old ly@@ re re@@ appears from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , abandoned logic , since it fits better to their power .
in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam gave answers to his American guests with regard to our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers .
he tar@@ nished the corresponding questions with non @-@ answers of a rational manner .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally find it a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
when Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to what country belongs to our city ...
in short , I don &apos;t understand anything .
I would be very grateful if our dear K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to elu@@ ci@@ date this point , provided it was paid highly to be part of the government of Singapore .
by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out the criticism that one should start reading the entire address of the conference , in order to better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and no country .
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneven even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when he said that Singapore was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who , as a leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore ...
at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard that expected me - I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing .
but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , associates correctly and is aware of what he def@@ ends .
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ sec@@ ts the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; &quot; &quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bad faith &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or was it a joy@@ ous advoc@@ ate ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
when Singapore is not a country , we are considered to be an independent and sovereign state ?
if not , what country does the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ?
Singapore is unique , it is equally country and city .
since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements are of serious importance .
why do the people of Singapore afford their military service , they only defend their city , but not their country ?
who does our prime minister have to pay back bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade adds to the affir@@ mation of Singapore and was always a city :
&quot; I didn &apos;t say what I said ... &quot;
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; defense of the country above all &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but that is not quite correct . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; &quot; &quot; global Vo@@ ices recently asked its editors : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home country or homeland ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world to be revealed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the question asked most in Japan is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are you Americans ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , sorry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions .
my clari@@ fication usually follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Hock@@ ey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook inner fur@@ y when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that .
for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that Canadi@@ ans differenti@@ ate from Americans .
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
all of Canadi@@ ans love .
Americans , on the other hand , ... .
so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 .
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
with us there are no weapons !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
all seem to think , Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is allegedly also considered to be the most toler@@ ant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate it .
first , I have many American friends , which I admire very much .
it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you &apos;d conf@@ use me to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
first , to be called &quot; nice &quot; means basically to be di@@ ligent - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , yet stran@@ gely in@@ significant figure of N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gänger ) .
if Canada was really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality .
there are no corners and edges , nothing at which you can push .
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to draw no attention .
this can be something good if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you .
I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadi@@ ans .
we tend to concern ourselves only with our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends .
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Jus@@ tin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ ody Thailand &apos;s Jun@@ ta
a pop band celebrated in Thailand has published a music video that par@@ o@@ dies the Jun@@ ta , which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to reign .
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations he makes his girl@@ friend .
although not politically politically , the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Jun@@ ta .
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to the song was a huge success .
within the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 Li@@ kes .
last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin Video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video .
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as regards the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of the video , which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued in the past three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional Constitution , which gives an absolute decision about important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 11th rule : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change your attitude &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; change in settings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and uncle@@ ar rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state .
for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , monitoring online content and prosec@@ uting people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy .
Thailand establishes a strict law against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Post ) .
on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand .
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money .
in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black v@@ ans before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem .
some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should offen@@ se the monarchy .
meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The tribute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the protests in 2014 .
life continues in the ruins of gh@@ ost towns in Eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and appears here with kind permission .
the post @-@ war society only slowly reco@@ vers in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
it has now been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war has officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still very visible in this part of the Republic .
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Shak@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ ch@@ ava are located in the coal bas@@ ins of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , depreci@@ ation , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together on sovi@@ et sites in the area .
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
today , most of the Russians and rab@@ bits live in the area .
such settlements are also called gh@@ ost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
during the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people still lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost towns .
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
since 2011 , the total population of the district amounted to 16@@ ,000 people after having barely risen over a decade .
in 1989 about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of war &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ storey blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called Chr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ uk@@ ov@@ kas , are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are decay and rarely , they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local elderly man .
he begins a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is nevertheless clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war , the village was full of life .
there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens who served all of the community .
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magnific@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in other villages it looks similar .
the K@@ hr@@ us@@ h@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still house one or two families , are recognizable at the balconies where laundry is dried .
two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house .
when they discover me with the camera in his hand , they withdraw immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girl@@ friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ eke@@ eping and vegetable cultivation .
it is difficult to come across the l@@ aps .
the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages in winter .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini &quot;
about ten years ago an elderly woman named Gal@@ ina ( or aunt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
despite her el@@ dest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will stay in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia forever , &quot; she tells .
Gal@@ ina doesn &apos;t want to accept any financial aid from her daughter and insi@@ sts that she supports her young grand@@ children instead .
Gal@@ inas &apos;s monthly rent is just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive , &quot; she says .
aunt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other vill@@ agers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when holidays are , we visit ourselves .
but we cannot do this all the time - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony .
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; T@@ ante G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini .
I have already prepared the floor .
I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build Zu@@ c@@ ch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war started .
every day she rec@@ alls the village life before the war .
despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the land of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply departed ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it .

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a bit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives approximately $ 9 child money for every child .
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was located once , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens .
she tells us that it was initially a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time it lost its anxi@@ ousness .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
but in fact it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right for them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
when our conversation ar@@ gues towards the end , a little boy runs past us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
while they are running , some of them throw stones onto the ru@@ ined buildings .
these ruins are part of their childhood , which care for in@@ convenience in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it any differently .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; accommo@@ dates migrants on their long journey
Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez conduc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala .

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with kind permission .
on the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality .
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
it is led by a 59@@ - year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink spectacle frame and gold coloured ear@@ ring in ted@@ dy bear shape .
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
for about $ 2.@@ 50 the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal .
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants come here .
sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells , people come to full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry : &quot; m@@ um Africa !
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time .
there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside .
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anybody .
she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey .
Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebas@@ ti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived shortly .
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was a proper nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the Sebas@@ ti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gurt ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he respon@@ ds with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebas@@ ti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
they have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already talk about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a builder on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup .
when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States .
he has been a guest of Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mr@@ s Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her to go again , &quot; he respon@@ ds smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
this winter Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken immigrants in their small house .
he is a polic@@ eman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar that night .
at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians .
some sleep on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside .
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience .
I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason I give them my support . &quot;
after having lived there for three years , he was exp@@ elled from the United States after a raid on his job .
the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them .
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children , who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person , a single @-@ mother , offered him her roof .
a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go .
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses , the travelers consult their tel@@ eph@@ ones quietly .
a mini@@ bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia .
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who have gone away .
like a proud grand@@ mother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
there is one of her daughter with African hair we@@ aving she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old .
she laughs sadly , while she briefly introduces her to me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she repe@@ ats every time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have gone away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a monitoring app on their phones .
a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users
the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in the west of China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their mobile phones .
on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi were given a mobile notification in which she as@@ signs the district government to install a monitoring app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent access to terrorist information &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism .
according to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they installed the app , exchanged messages with a private chat group .
the police report states that the app would investigate and track the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents .
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a security service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their own home network .
this app , featuring filters for min@@ ors , aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; remote control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal the home network of a person . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region .
while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China focus mostly on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in distant , afflicted ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet .
to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , authorities often associate extreme cens@@ ors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs .
the media outlets , which are based on Twitter , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents random@@ ly as to whether they had installed the monitoring app .
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
if you are spotted at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be det@@ ained up to 10 days .
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of imprisonment with the rest of the rest .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images from mainland China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description which indicates that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus gain unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .

a current Freedom House report , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods :

sleep or death , part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death

&quot; &quot; &quot; this is the first of six reports in the row &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot; &quot; &quot;
far from our blue , virtual world , you look at yourself and discover that you are all alone in a place where everything is missing .
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly visible , both inside and outside .
one that makes all honor to her name .
one that has settled into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
but when reality rec@@ alls you and you look behind the scenes - beyond acting , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters transform into beings of flesh and blood , and all cri@@ es after death .
all doubts arise in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of the un@@ healed . it becomes clear to you that you are caught between the walls that your parents have , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone by stone .
they have arrested me and my father thri@@ ce , but that was not enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson &quot; as the boss of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure .
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest .
it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; cri@@ es .
all the neighbor@@ hoods cov@@ eted , only my own not .
for the first time it was quiet , mo@@ tion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I did not put high demands on a city that is blocked up into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their accompli@@ ces .
in the third night things had cal@@ med down a bit after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I heard my voice resist@@ ed through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
many friends , true friends joined me ; we were alli@@ ed to a magnificent picture that fulfilled my expectations completely and completely .
in such a moment you are aware that you release the Spirit from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low down - nothing can give you back your voice after you scre@@ amed the whole way to the office of the security service from the body .
I arrived there .
the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I am now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Col@@ onel Gh@@ ass@@ an starts to say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let me hear how you write &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not near . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were on me .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and you really trust what to look into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what I then did has nothing to do with courage .
I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building .
perhaps it was my foo@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was so sure when I replied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I think I have never stopped looking into my eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the shortest conversation that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I do not repent of what I have said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; put him in sol@@ itary confin@@ ement and his father alike . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his father is equal to that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he became a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; a mental torture I was exposed for months . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with myself .
then again through the farm and into the second office that leads through a corridor to the individual cells .
I am pre@@ ten@@ ding to detail all the details before I enter the room .
unlike anything else , they probably have allocated a larger cell to me this time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to share it with only one other prisoner and can immediately set me without waiting for their permission . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the officer left the cell , and I got back to an old @-@ tried method of communication : to fight against the wall .
I learned that my cell phone was a &quot; first @-@ hand . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
apparently none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
in perfect darkness , no prominent fac@@ ul@@ s can be seen on me , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all numbers only .
&quot; perhaps someone whose voice sounds like mine ? &quot;
all answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him if I remain .
li@@ ars .
I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row in order to drive out all these crow@@ s , which feed on the fruits in the garden of my head .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the distance I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the cri@@ es , every day .
the door opens .
I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to 13 S@@ ure of the Kor@@ an ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are here to be heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus the secret was lifted : in order to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ it@@ or and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their sec@@ t@@ arian black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world@@ view .
this is not a home here , this is not a country ; it is a curse they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero .
I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and stub@@ born man ; at least he seems to me so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he starts a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that par@@ don him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this Ta@@ ge@@ di@@ eben and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I did not answer .
I got used to it , not to answer .
I really can &apos;t tell you exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary means of communication for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I didn &apos;t do anything to earn this penalty .
of punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube , which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot keep your cri@@ es back .
my cri@@ es were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable .
at my first arrest , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a garbage collector earlier or whether that belonged to the normal work equipment .
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to present us , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable .
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still on the line .
I had lost all feeling in my body - and my voice too , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming .
the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and found no pleasure in doing so , which is why it was the next to an electrically charged rod .
electricity flow@@ ed through my whole body , enough to supply my entire district .
my semi @-@ naked body , stretched out on the ground , was the perfect current conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two aw@@ ful hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed , which happened to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move you , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always released me .
where do they lead me ? !
the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ al@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and opposition
Em@@ al@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text .
Em@@ al@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time inside ; sometimes he shu@@ ff@@ les to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch .
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips filed with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
he lives in the top@@ most floor of his family house , which belonged to them since 1967 ; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as rocky ( about : Far@@ mer ) .
for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faced the conservative majority and questioned its old @-@ established opinions on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ score .
with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , Rac@@ ism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man , but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria and to San@@ aa in Yemen .
with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can feel the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya .
even if he doesn &apos;t openly admit it , he has a special a@@ version against the US foreign policy .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees from the second generation &quot; - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now .
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a man , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; while he po@@ urs in water , Nes@@ café sh@@ akes in two cups . it is the Holy month Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam .
basically , the fla@@ x of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the ra@@ kes of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom .
sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you have a look at neighboring countries .
therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan water to drink - in order not to land in prison .
recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time .
some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosex@@ ual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the country &apos;s cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was cancelled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism which in@@ quired the old @-@ proven legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region .
in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la under@@ estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to use &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
this statement probably should not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric but in fact an increasingly clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality reflected in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work .
in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b reg@@ ained traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex .
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas .
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust .
over the past few years , the number of &apos; honour mur@@ ders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside .
according to Human Rights Watch , the number of honorary mor@@ als reached its peak in 2016 ; however , there is still more ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who were victims of mur@@ ders or domestic violence in an appropriate way .
according to a law on fi@@ ref@@ igh@@ ting from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; in@@ definitely be held in prison , &quot; and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman won &apos;t happen .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music is also very popular and is well @-@ known not to shy away from issues that have long been tab@@ oo in his country .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; politics has been so@@ lic@@ ited to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ es the question of Palestinian identity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the core can be continued .
in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song , a verse often repe@@ ats itself :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosex@@ u@@ ality .
he notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + individuals have been cens@@ ored in 2014 even until 2014 .
in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to note later that his comments from the context were torn , twisted and cens@@ ored in his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but only a revised version , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosex@@ uals does not correspond to Islam .
he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ evo , a poet of the eighth century , which is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems .
H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ evo , who later was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosex@@ u@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ?
the real problem , like H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled .
in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite realm , there is nothing new anymore that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
more recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association , with the reason that they had cri@@ tically expressed concern on the issues related to corruption in the country .
in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ bs is said to be just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans .
for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now den@@ ounced M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is what H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees - consists of slow , deliber@@ ate and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society .
in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad .
he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot;
perhaps the region is approached by music , art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , streaming uni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally directed demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least he hopes that .
until it is ready , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist .

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
it is assumed that there is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies of West Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous people of the region , the Emis@@ hi to the knees .
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
we could snap up a few great seats , so we have a great view .
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
a community center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally .
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two fixed cars are just to be seen .
nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only truth - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer :
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high van was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange weapons against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

rarely , external appearance and body care were as important as in this story , as they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dresser .
El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital , a region with a very high crime rate where street @-@ consuming and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place .
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe .
at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men .
the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can reproduce these elaborate hair@@ styles .
the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the ou@@ ter@@ most limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 .
there , experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
educational institutions such as the August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy School , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , have an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dres@@ sers and to receive training in hair@@ dressing , which allows them to find work .
motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
the school presented special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
in 1995 we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district we are very proud of , because we have built up this educational community for love for the children .
Colombia : love letters to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ sal@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the following article is the revised version of the contribution &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Love messages to gu@@ er@@ illa fighters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
isn &apos;t it much more important , people who feel exp@@ elled , aff@@ ection ?
this was precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ a Foundation and Cris@@ tian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the Cart@@ a p@@ or la Rec@@ on@@ cili@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ciliation ) campaign , encouraging young people to write letters to gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace agreement with the F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America .
the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that Colom@@ bian President José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its .
however , in front of the Colom@@ bian people there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace .
gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years , who had been subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carrying weapons around the clock , must now re @-@ integrate themselves into life as civilians .
the Colom@@ bian society , in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards gu@@ er@@ illa fighters , must now take these into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life .
Leonardo and Cris@@ tian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians could join together and help the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ er@@ illa fighter , which is to be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
the idea for reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Cris@@ tian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 .
this one explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need them much more .
he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent need .
thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who will now find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace , &quot; they say .
more than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign so far .
the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á .
&apos;@@ i never thought someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca .
a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ a Foundation go to the camp to personally transfer the letters .
the members of the F@@ ARC focused on how they had done it earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country .
it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later .
Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience :
after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or took me through the camp of the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
when I looked into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighter who wrote something .
I was afraid to go in , because next to him lying on the bed was a M@@ GL pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I told him anyway and asked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
never before in my life someone wrote something like a nice thing , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly , the tears ran over the che@@ eks .
I hu@@ gged him all firmly and sat next to the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate .
perhaps he was sorry for the war too , was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years , and wanted to help him write this letter .
the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . joining the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from star@@ vation . &quot; I would never have thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know that there is a society outside , waiting for us with open arms .
until now I only learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but now where peace rules , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
new voices and voices
as a pr@@ el@@ ude , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion group .
the students were all grown up as already a war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
that is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organisation , their ide@@ als , and gave an insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice done on the part of the state on the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can help shape society more just@@ ly in this country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
hearing these people who haven &apos;t found a hearing before and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me .
the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me .
but it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and hu@@ g .
many former fighters answered the letters .
Gust@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp &apos;s commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote , for example , Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the arch@@ bishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter :
the Colom@@ bian people were prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ arm@@ ament there would be peace .
but this is not the case .
as long as there is ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , raise themselves and protest for their rights . and that is also fully justified ( ... ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war .
we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties .
on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them .

homosex@@ uals and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail .
with hor@@ r@@ ors activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but the threat , which depends on the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community in the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q community , did not come into existence only overnight .
OC Media had the opportunity to talk with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic .
several months ago , the LG@@ B@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines after reports have been published that deal with wor@@ sen@@ ing , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic .
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities suspected of susp@@ icious qu@@ eer men and hiding them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ man , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there .
since her childhood she felt that she was a woman in reality .
when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow .
after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had learned from the gender equality of their coun@@ try@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened .
fear@@ ful for her life , she moved to the United States .
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble .
she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation .
while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that , the photos of my documents through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round .
on October 10 , 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when I was about to fet@@ ch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your unc@@ le . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I hurt nothing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time on Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how long do you want to dish@@ on@@ or the family , you sc@@ andal ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old .
then I lost consciousness and wo@@ ke up in the hospital at the end of the night .
apparently some women had everything to get along and started scre@@ aming .
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two broken wounds in my right lung .
OC Media : in which wings were you placed - in which men or women ?
Sab@@ rina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there &apos;s still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women .
I am very grateful for that .
when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it afraid to do ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name .
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has dealt with me respect@@ fully .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February , I received threats .
they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown .
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
they asked me to return to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that this was all a lie .
they made absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by running up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my gender , that everything was just bad , and Photos@@ hop .
I have gran@@ ny size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for her .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
my mother was too much and she laid a rope around her neck .
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number@@ plate with a 95 on it .
after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was a bit la@@ zy .
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
for security reasons I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me .
with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened .
I can still not understand how it could be .
just before leaving Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
I bought it without regi@@ stering me , without identification without everything .
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone .
at the moment when I wanted to invo@@ ke my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t think you &apos;d be safe , just because you left the country ?
our people already know in which hotel you hide . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a tab@@ oo subject .
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier .
I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her .
when we chat with camera , I am actually trying to look like the person she rec@@ alls from her past - so to my male form .
but this is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
for this I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I talked to someone who sat in gun for one and a half months .
he said that during Ram@@ adan , there were no people arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not shut up a new wave .
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
with this I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction .
OC Media : are gay men now still captured in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there would not be so many .
if , then , above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to present themselves to Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment .
as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you understand ?
as if these people were not simply disappeared , but deliberately sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise .
OC Media : is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone imprisoned in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard had grown .
there has been nothing new from them ever since .
they simply took them along .
and this so @-@ called Lord , that person himself was there when these people were taken along .
up to now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports so far . we suspect that such actions are quite possible .
why else would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know whether these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people belonging to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya , I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite big Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems .
on the contrary , it was much safer than now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Russia wanted to bring us to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ci@@ vi@@ liz@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but eventually pushed us back into the Stone Age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had dy@@ ed lashes , wore tu@@ bular jeans and short loops .
the Ministry of Health of Sh@@ aria has never cro@@ oked me just one hair .
in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially at weekends , met a whole group of people like me .
it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there .
we have never been offen@@ ded .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
it is often said to children when they make fun of the sick .
OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill ?
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never insul@@ ted me , never ch@@ ased me and never beaten me .
OC Media : how long did this time of grace begin ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ rov came to the plan for a long time .
when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television .
he did not talk about us per se , but primarily on women &apos;s behavior .
nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city .
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
but every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly wor@@ sen@@ ing .
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US .
apart from that I &apos;m still active as an activ@@ ist .
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
we organize te@@ ac@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards .
I don &apos;t make a cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ apped out refu@@ ges .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ bern .
so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion .
this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to prophes@@ y with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I &apos;m from there , so it &apos;s unpleasant to hear something like that .
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
do you know many think about the transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy .
these are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact , different attitudes of life .
for me , it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personally here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago .
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
since the last few months there is a strong rise in suicide .
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , characterised by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight .
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region in the south @-@ west of Iran .
he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness to be able to stand up for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who want to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and wish to remain anonymous .
a video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kind@@ led himself .
some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the fl@@ ames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ hani hospital in the town of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more .
he died a short time later .
it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives .
the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - have suffered .
their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government .
Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination
the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livel@@ ihood .
a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ la@@ vi monarchy took over power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran .
in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture .
despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop only slowly , and the local population only gets little from this wealth .
it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and priv@@ ation .
the Iranian regime systematically refuses to produce jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries .
the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that diver@@ ge water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are located .
these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries .
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ k young@@ sters increased to 81 % .
N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director of Co@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % secondary school and 45 % have a university degree .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist with resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and ra@@ cial ethnic discrimination &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as officials and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors .
this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and comp@@ el them to earn their living outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z .
there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace , let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes .
given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi , human rights activists suggest an alarm before the situation is explosive .
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and aware of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , even with inter@@ sec@@ tional ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Comm@@ ons license .
the following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
when I say that I am not a femin@@ ist , many women react - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with fru@@ stration .
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought @-@ out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we should generally be all femin@@ ist * inside .
for example , despite equal education women still earn less money than men nowadays .
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
or that cultural and social norms will still cause women to stum@@ ble sooner or later in various spheres of life on a glass ceiling , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs .
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple below .
I am a black woman .
and yet : if I come to speak on skin color , on ra@@ cism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the femin@@ ist movement , many white femin@@ ists decide to silence femin@@ ists .
however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to &quot; lift up their voices and &apos; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &apos; , in order to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women .
but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alized form of ra@@ cially motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways .
or that black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls , due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the one hand , I want all women to have equal rights for all men and all men . on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement whose centre is the white woman who refuses to take into account injus@@ tices in their thinking , which refer both to gender and skin colour of a person .
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist @-@ oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women .
in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compl@@ ained in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in an historical sense a men@@ tion@@ less and margin@@ alized being .
I refuse to join group@@ ings , which in addition absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation to advance their eg@@ oc@@ entri@@ c program .
I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin color and gender . some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better .
although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name .
I prefer to release myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism and join the Movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , rather than advoc@@ ating myself for a white @-@ femin@@ ist paradig@@ m that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us .
Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : rec@@ laim@@ ing , says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped , which make up the black woman .
although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black woman is affected .
in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures , because I exist in this paradig@@ m .
I am recognized as a part of this paradig@@ m due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment in which my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored , nor rejected .
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
this contribution from To@@ d@@ d Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems .
as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again .
again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the last 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern of the Kur@@ dist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations .
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains us his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tells Mus@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq .
Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization of Water@@ keepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ keepers Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ ari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water any more , how would we survive then ? &quot;
this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , an Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film and multimedia journalist .
the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little not@@ e@@ worthy sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities that can tell their stories in their own way .

a police inspec@@ tor said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent towards her .
since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put into the files , but more could not be done .
when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the well @-@ known display of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez also took advantage of nothing .
a few days later , the second wife retired .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
in general , if women make an ad at all , they generally do not receive any support from the state .
in many cases , the women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit being victims of violence must notify the prosecution authorities at all .
cont@@ ent@@ s@@ 1 Stri@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a legal system that does not unter@@ ni@@ mm@@ t@@ 3 Paragu@@ ay laws : good approach , flaw@@ ed implementation beats and statistics
it is difficult to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social science research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports , which , however , do not even point out the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
however , the figures available are al@@ arming .
in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence at the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office . 70 % of these were violence against women .
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace . here too 86 % of the ads of women came .
in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse .
these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ardi , only a few of these crimes are actually displayed . &quot; there are 9 women who do not do so in Paraguay because of psychological abuse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on every woman who is subject to physical abuse , two women who do not do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she declared at the end of 2014 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal act , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners .
until August 2016 alone , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of suicide in the country .
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies because of violent acts by men .

invisible abuse and a legal system that does not under@@ mine
before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insist@@ ed that she named him the names of all her former friends .
at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she did . this should always be regre@@ t@@ table .
today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable :
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
when I read about it before , I always thought that only women who are too sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men .
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report ab@@ uses by Carlos Vera .
without nam@@ ing a name , she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her .
many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he rhet@@ or@@ ically asked if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse .
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why she had enjoyed Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him in the past .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some kind of complic@@ ity .
Victoria San@@ tos , who was not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner ab@@ used them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe you &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) composed of women who are all victims of abuse in some way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other .
they do what many others do not do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psychological abuse .
her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
Victori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives , she received no support .
she led a trial against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ a@@ geable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner .
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , poor implementation
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country .
on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # for you ) .
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os ( # Non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Am@@ ne@@ sty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d to an independent criminal act and to punish the hard@@ est as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
thus the text was changed in a number of points in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , fear@@ ing that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is generally forbidden , which is in principle forbidden in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment .
the original bill had envis@@ aged most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs which the victims of violence have to carry on themselves , if they simply furnis@@ h indication and want a secure accommodation to impose the state .
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
in Paraguay abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships .
here a re@@ thinking must take place , so violence is no longer regarded as a normal thing .
whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the offen@@ ders get away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to refund as long as mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been changed , including a passage taken by the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation .
opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the submission of the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gender &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; political force &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot; &quot; &quot;

independent media in Oman suspended one year after bann@@ ing a newspaper
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago , the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ tan .
You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , remains in prison , where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence .
two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were arrested and put in trial , but later released .
Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had put his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , through a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Finance Minister , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank .
the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , in particular domestic secret services , civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , restric@@ ting and det@@ ecting human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists .
the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in public authorities and institutions , both online and offline .
the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country .
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
on July 28 , 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , found an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; this was about corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in judicial decisions .
in the report government officials were accused of having pressur@@ ised judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a inheritance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n of 26 July 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo source : Facebook page of Az@@ am@@ n
on 3 August 2016 , he was charged Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a member of the editorial committee , from ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces .
on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is &apos;s arrest .
the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; publishing and spreading the paper on any way , including online , is banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the Court in Mas@@ at .
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of dis@@ ruption of public order , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the pres@@ tige of the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of breach of a ban on publication and de@@ fam@@ ation .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of $ 3,000 each ( $ 7@@ 800 ) . furthermore , a year @-@ long career prohibition against the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to dissemin@@ ate material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
for al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , a damage deposit of 5,000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al was established ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 .
the App@@ eals Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 and sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six months sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ at . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his imprisonment sentence .
the App@@ eals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; newspaper .
in spite of the decision of the Court to rel@@ inqu@@ ish Az@@ am@@ n , the paper is still facing attacks by the Iranian government .
on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended three months .
on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the minister presented himself once again against the decision of the App@@ eals Court to restore the publication of the newspaper .
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks against journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently viol@@ ated the freedom of the press .
further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atine and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation .
due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression arises that the Iranian authorities are still un@@ willing to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press .
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Iranian authorities :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j promptly and un@@ condi@@ tionally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can follow their work ;
3. to protect the press freedom in the country and
4 . to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman un@@ hin@@ dered their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation measures , including judicial har@@ ass@@ ment .
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ governmental and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring states by promoting the freedom of expression and association and the right to assemble , support and protect them .

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , mapping takes place with his agreement
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on @-@ site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investments for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem .
secondly , research conducted by African scientists is helping establish its own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent .
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , CI@@ DR@@ Z ) .
he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia in the 1990s , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed a serious impact on national health .
he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana .
as a post @-@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself resear@@ ched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the S@@ á@@ b health system .
with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research .
( disc@@ laim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier talks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GV ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the Sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
in addition , I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens .
GV : what do you think is the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being makers .
the solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here .
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are funded differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not previously have ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet .
laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GM : how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on , and how can we support the development ?
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
there is a need for special academic training , starting at any age .
social sciences , computer science , big data , research of space , healthcare ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly .
GM : can you describe the pro@@ s and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries based on your experience ?
RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the system that magazines can only make articles against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
this contribution from Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website of En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide .
Frank Mor@@ ton has bred a salad in the USA since the 1980s .
its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ Gor@@ geous , the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space .
for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work has been limited only by its own resour@@ c@@ ef@@ ulness and the question of how many species of salads he can get .
but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
the patents lay not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cur@@ ly leaves .
in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants like cer@@ eal or cart@@ on varieties . based on these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production .
as a passionate representative of a m@@ illen@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still cultiv@@ ating salad , but meanwhile he needs longer because his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is as if there is a b@@ oul@@ der in a river that I have to mate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that these patents go far too far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if they stand in court , nobody can breed any new species of let@@ tu@@ ce , because all characteristics have already been patented . &quot; he continues to do as good as possible and tries to extract the characteristics he wants .
however , it is very careful and endeav@@ ours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property .
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and around the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts at the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the Out@@ red@@ st variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coinci@@ dence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT field and not from the area of plant breeding .
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for open @-@ source seeds ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders .
as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i ( O@@ ss@@ i ) , US breeders may commit that others can use the seeds bred by them freely .
this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell them . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately cut it off - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents .
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
for the em@@ eri@@ ated professor at the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection .
as a result , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance .
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not deal with genetically modified plants .
all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control of the seed , whose recent examples are the amal@@ gam@@ ations of Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer . &quot; those who want to buy good , locally and sustain@@ ably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables are grown is threatened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seed available to others . in contrast , their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics .
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the growing intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore increasingly available .
Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all the cart@@ on features are protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeders at all or only difficult .
for other plants , such estimates do not yet exist , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots .
a question of view
plants are bred in such a way that they have pur@@ pos@@ efully desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and resist threats such as p@@ ests or diseases .
opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , as the changed conditions are much worse than ever due to climate change .
in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokesperson Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture set up the company for the conservation of genetic diversity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders , since &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot; &quot; &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result .
so , such protection does not block innovations , but encourages them by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
Mor@@ ton sees this differently : waiting for 20 years until a patent expi@@ red , certainly does not promote innovation .
and if one has to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have already lost the struggle .
however , the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources should always have been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us .
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in general , Mor@@ ton is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not really create the features ourselves . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plants form them themselves and as a bree@@ der , we have no idea how the plants do that .
a mystery of nature . &quot;
for Car@@ ol Dep@@ pe , plant breeders in the US state Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety breed their own values into them .
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for their cultivation in mass @-@ wise her@@ b@@ ici@@ des , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my concept is exactly opposite . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( those who move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ san@@ to ) , they manage most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case .
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mor@@ ton looks for salads in his breeding garden .

Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders are more innovative by avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent .
I always need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years , making it easy in my opinion . &quot; worldwide response
although the US seems to be a leader in Open Source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly around the world .
in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , is a &quot; open source &quot; seed program . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German organization Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open @-@ source &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; license which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( rules for breeding vary from country to country , so the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be taken one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able , thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants .
however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line .
in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; open source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the open source seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds .
Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for open source seed systems , explains that the organization currently builds a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start @-@ up should be scheduled next year .
a combination of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map .
in September , Global Alliance for the Future of Food , a global alliance for the future of food , has published a report for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others .
the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has especially taken place where and how something is grown , and seed systems have barely played a role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

human rights organisations and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nist .
on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above .
in August , the network published an opinion on Facebook , in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
the Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true , despite this attack and the mo@@ ck@@ ery of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law in order to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals , it was never as important as now .
AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news site M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based network of Al Jaz@@ e@@ era for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website barriers to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no access to the blog of colum@@ nist and human rights researcher Ah@@ med Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada .
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible for Egypt .
now the blog , which he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , became the goal of an attack .
blo@@ gger , the provider in which also Canada &apos;s blog is given a home , is further accessible .
Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students .
his articles mainly revol@@ ve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the ban by the government and reflected what this meant for him :
the blo@@ gs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even though the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me :
1 ) They have managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege ; arrest , attempted murder , discharge at the national Security Council , blocked blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked .
2 ) You proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , al@@ beit only to a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
but now , after blocking it and that they are afraid of words , I still can change the link or create a second blog .
the brave ones go the way to the end .
according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133 . this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at .
in addition , af@@ te also documented the blocking of providers , through which internet cens@@ orship and private surfing was possible , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s )
af@@ te reported in her research :
on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of web pages which V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began .
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content that might have access to the Egyptian users .
the situation is also wor@@ sen@@ ed by the fact that the decisions of the cens@@ orship are taken behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed in court against these actions .
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack it next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .

day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with glo@@ omy head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs .
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves Rob@@ ben Phar@@ m@@ acy with Military We@@ ap@@ ons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the force wave 2017 in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; find at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; known for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the paper explained the motives for their decision :
extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime , etc . everything that happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal !
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty .
in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was no reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure :
extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognize the war .
in the same video , a journalist explained that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations .
in the editorial , the newspaper writes :
we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions .
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues against calling the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification for the failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult for the police to account .
this is not a war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ acent negl@@ ect of public service . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reminder : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital .

&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is wrong : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most recent available data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when we look at the kill@@ ings per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she writes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
extra belongs to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as in Cec@@ í@@ lia emphas@@ ises , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years .
these safety policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003 , whose goal is to capture a F@@ av@@ ela by using a massive police custody and permanently station@@ ed there .
in the beginning , this actually led to a decline in violent deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ anes and repression against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit .
on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot;
he writes :
in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people .
this requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot;
war or her , the fact is that the inhabitants of the F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio .
it is now a week that the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ op@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
in the midst of all this violence this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter .

to stay alive : to learn to plant mushrooms , to plant mushrooms
screen@@ shot from the advertising video .

since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , chi@@ ef@@ ly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops .
according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the Research Institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and Id@@ li@@ b .
the East Gh@@ out@@ a region is particularly badly affected , where an attack on chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians .
many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition anticip@@ ate that the Assad regime &apos;s massacre was perpet@@ rated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations .
since 2013 , these areas , controlled by rebel forces , have been besieg@@ ed outside Damascus , leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points .
through the years of block@@ age , traditional food , such as meat , has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population .
as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms are not among the common foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food @-@ worth@@ iness makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
the direct of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , spoke to the French news agency AF@@ P :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Dr. Ah@@ med Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that more and more &quot; gains awareness . &quot;
in order to collect money for the initiative , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do is used in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da .
it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge for planting mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices .
at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 € , but will continue to raise funds to Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 September 2017 .
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
because of the fuel shor@@ tages , locally produced fuels are made of plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they started with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; production from the regions of the mushroom &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the start of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed fung@@ i everywhere in the East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; breaking the siege . &quot; &quot; &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , etc . ) for the extraction of new foods .
creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home .
creation of new jobs for people with disabilities tied to their homes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and siege are visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested in many district capital cities on 21 October in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires ra@@ ging in the north of Portugal in the week before .
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured due to forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government spending a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain , where there were 4 deaths .
it is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages .
in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded .
according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite recording , approximately 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the district Lisbon .
so that you can get a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

numerous videos spread on the net and show images that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the goal of the protests on Saturday was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people wonder@@ ed why civil protection was not able to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
Jo@@ ão So@@ ver@@ al from the Federation of Far@@ mers from Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co :
after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing .
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , building permits in locations with a high fire risk are questioned .
a far @-@ reaching proposal for the reform of the forest , which the government had introduced after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the commun@@ es who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government introduced an e@@ asing of the law provided by the applicant by means of self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor allowing everything to be built , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article published by the newspaper P@@ ú@@ bli@@ co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the environmental organization Quer@@ cus pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this species .
in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives , was offline .
it was a private initiative that supplied the population with information : it used the application of civilians using the application fo@@ g@@ os.@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires .
the project was launched in 2015 by Jo@@ ão P@@ ina developer to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the site counted more than half a million hits .

in one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Tali@@ ban .
two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan has become a country of terror and despair .
exactly at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , met in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central African Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner .
even though his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more .
in the morning , the boy was supposed to break up .
his unc@@ le would pick him up and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Tali@@ ban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess .
the Tali@@ ban , known for their hatred of Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran .
a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan .
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran . once again , he was in a foreign country with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his livel@@ ihood .
at that time , like today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night . &quot;
after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe .
during the dangerous crossing of the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island .
after the Greek authorities rejected asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 .
some time , A@@ shar@@ af was hom@@ eless , ran through the streets of Rome alone , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to auxiliary persons twice a day .
it is true that due to relatively high growth rates , Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seek@@ ers . it is true , however , that the conditions that find asylum seek@@ ers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the civil rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the large majority of asylum seek@@ ers are housed in more than 3000 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; special admission centres &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to an admission center if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be taken for months after the filing of the asylum application .
until then , people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street .
that &apos;s how it was A@@ shar@@ af .
but his un@@ willing life @-@ willingness helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his entire savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice .
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now the subject of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind ven@@ eti@@ an luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film won the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles .
according to in@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy .
for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries .
in recent years , some Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants .
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world .
the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts .
Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the Restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
but A@@ shar@@ af@@ s goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy trade and retail and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where there is a risk , there are also possibilities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering .
I am planning a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; so they can sell their harvest excess on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says .
the development to a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end stability and prosperity stand .
A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey by himself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey .
N@@ eti@@ zen Report : crimes of law from Egypt enable de@@ activation of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in detention .
he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ v@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the suspension of President Mohamed Mor@@ si .

the Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after regi@@ stering with a government agency .
users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their ID number within six months following the submission of the law .
those who negl@@ ect this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the final penalty of a penalty .
the law , which was promoted by sixty parliam@@ ent@@ arians , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in May , another member filed a legislative proposal in which tough@@ er pen@@ alties would be introduced to the president or a high official . &quot; &quot; &quot;
under Egyptian law , the decision of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ish@@ able . however , under the legislative proposal , such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy .
if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for those convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who took photographs on 13 August 2013 when he photograph@@ ed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who fought against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si .
Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , as more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested at the same incident four years in prison for a court appointment .
recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May because the prison leadership failed to bring the accused of prison into the cour@@ t@@ room , according to human rights groups .
Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened with death penalty due to the fact that many human rights groups agree on the apparent burden of fire , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder .
in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iz@@ a released the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ vi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
the Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly who were also arrested at the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years .
Tun@@ isian activists to inter@@ ro@@ gate documents
in May , Tun@@ isian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia was basically inter@@ ro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , who , according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft law , would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali the corruption accused officials of am@@ ne@@ sty if they return all un@@ lawful funds .
the document published on 21 April on the Na@@ wa@@ at website sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of law look like .
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the mention of his sources , stating Article 11 of the Tun@@ isian press code , which journalists secure the right to protect their sources .
nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case .
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
according to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media .
in the rules it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts believe that in this way the elimination of anonymous comments is to be achieved within social networks . it is up to now uncle@@ ar how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only sel@@ ectively en@@ force these regulations in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence .
then do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
according to Ros@@ com@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat agreed to register as the &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information . &quot;
this term is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to make said services for the removal of content and to force it on request for the delivery of user data .
these web pages currently include web sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ clas@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , email service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services .
Turkish court has blocked Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
a Turkish court ordered the release of Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication had been blocked because it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups to make a political diffusion campaign against Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible .
great Britain can &apos;t stop to sni@@ ff
after this week , the UK government is in the midst of targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption .
the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside .
despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior .
