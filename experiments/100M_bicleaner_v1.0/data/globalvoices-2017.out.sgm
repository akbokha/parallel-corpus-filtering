<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA at least once a year since 2012, I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">Like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and ran their sport.</seg>
<seg id="5">In fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film.</seg>
<seg id="6">As a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, uncovered the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnate, who wanted to occupy the Supreme Federal Constitutional Court with judges who were interested in his interest.</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "according to Method Man," "" "I was like it was the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">And the year I lived in Arizona had only intensified my admiration for the US.</seg>
<seg id="10">I always said, "America is the only country in which I have ever lived whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very fanatical love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">With his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as he says so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">He tells exactly what he thinks like a former colleague, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and tuned for him in droves.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 13 million votes he won in the Republican pre-elections was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the party ever reached.</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">For example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silke, director of the journalism programme, who receives people from all over the world, a deeply believer man with whom I was able to talk about Islam and his past.</seg>
<seg id="23">Also Trumps Weltanschauung did not agree with Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the "Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met our shared love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">Trumps intolerance is also in contrast to generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who battles the environment for her lifetime, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like their son.</seg>
<seg id="26">It still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me and my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">Then there were Andrew Lecce, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise council has helped me a lot in my career.</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">While Trump cleared his way to the nominees of Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and counterpart to his limited vision of America.</seg>
<seg id="30">It turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">On November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly whites, presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps precisely because of his contempt against non-white people.</seg>
<seg id="32">The debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared their racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook those things, almost broke my heart.</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">To classify the people, one of my friends said, is exactly what led us to this situation.</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">Could it be that these voters, of whom most of them know, have voted for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that has disappointed them?</seg>
<seg id="38">In other words, would they perhaps say they are still important in this America?</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">However, it is hard to forget the words of David Remnick, who commentates on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him.</seg>
<seg id="41">This "Whitelash" (WT).: as much as the white against all other ethnicities; the white and whiplash word game, as the great Van Jones mentioned, has exactly what America did so great.</seg>
<seg id="42">Millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is nevertheless a powerful idea - what faith or background you may have, America is all welcome.</seg>
<seg id="43">For this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyan man, whose history as he says himself would not be possible anywhere else in the world.</seg>
<seg id="44">But with the choice Donald Trumps, there is a huge portion of the white Americas on this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism.</seg>
<seg id="45">In America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say.</seg>
<seg id="46">In all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of election.</seg>
<seg id="47">At a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan.</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"" "" "" "would Muslims have a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"did Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices were louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "if someone is not like you, a place in your America?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">"" "he received a unanimous and loud" "" "NO" "" "!" ""</seg>
<seg id="58">Mr. Khan concluded with the words: "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." 36 hours later he was corrected.</seg>
<seg id="59">The country for which his son had fallen, sent him a message.</seg>
<seg id="60">This is Trumps Land, said the news.</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could find no place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And it breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="66">From the misery to the stars: these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rubbish</seg>
<seg id="67">The "Recycled Instruments Orchestra" by Cateura, Paraguay, during a concert in Washington DC.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in Oaxaca, with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">That the music played at both venues not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with...</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a big garbage dump, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town which is very popular with tourists - but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="73">For some years now, La banda de MÃºsica (music bande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults who has found a way to overcome the poverty surrounding them with their musical instruments.</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central concern for the church of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">The community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its abuse of drugs and bananas.</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a casual meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope for the youth.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI writes:</seg>
<seg id="79">As soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion.</seg>
<seg id="80">They always come laughing and playing with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga.</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">More than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura - a village located at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:</seg>
<seg id="83">Music with reprocessed instruments composed of local solid waste materials produced in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez have begun to transform parts of waste into instruments.</seg>
<seg id="84">The instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all of which were made of trash.</seg>
<seg id="85">The repertoire encompasses classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra and so on.</seg>
<seg id="86">In an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio ChÃ¡vez, a local ecologist and musician of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as a favio something that he had never seen before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing instruments made of reprocessed material and called The Recycled Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they transform it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music in front of Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can fight illegal fishing successfully</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">This post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that reports specifically about international, practiced solutions for environmental problems.</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-publication takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices for sharing content.</seg>
<seg id="100">In West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in the Liberian waters before it visited the other coast of Africa.</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were so upset and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this kind to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles were swiftly mobilized against the ship. they refused to bump one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permits.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "" "said Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Authority. he is part of a team who discovered and pursued the ship at that time." ""</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">Ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to the looting of the country's fish stocks.</seg>
<seg id="106">The core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries founded in 2012 by the NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries).</seg>
<seg id="107">In addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that then expelled the prime minister from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "" "" "we have eight countries that are like this and work together. they exchange information and help each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "" "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust Project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="109">Illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden because it is extremely difficult to detect. illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions.</seg>
<seg id="110">Due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by means of which certain habitats and types are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance.</seg>
<seg id="111">But while actions against illegal fishing were once severely hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and through the snail empo, with the information between individual countries, these actions happen in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform.</seg>
<seg id="112">There, for example, the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, news about suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour inspection.</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also closely monitors the activities of ships when they move on the open seas by means of satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in forbidden areas. such suspicious driving routes can also be discovered - such as those suggesting that a ship will load its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">Ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal code.</seg>
<seg id="116">Countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports, which means that ships cannot sell their cargo. and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister.</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "" "" "then there is considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not profitable any more." ""</seg>
<seg id="118">And that's what we want to achieve, "says Per Erik Bergh, chief director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultancy firm who advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i.</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to recover estimated 20 million USD of lost revenue, which the eight members of the HISH-i network lose every year because of the illegal fishermen entering East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, so the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illegal fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">Their practices include activities such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, imaginations, fishing protected species, and fishing in nature reserves.</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they purposefully use the lack of international cooperation and make use of the weaknesses of a non-patently organised control system," "" "says Long." "" "previously, a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say" "" "You cannot walk my port" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"" "but another country could say" "" "Come to me" "". "" "" "and this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has been working so far.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used multiple fraudulent identities and it has tracked and found volatile ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">Due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances.</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "" "says Bergh." ""</seg>
<seg id="130">It builds a system that aims to help FISH-i to locate suspicious ships more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to detect the illegal ships that like to hide.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "" "" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position," "" "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishery data and offers technical support for FISH-i." ""</seg>
<seg id="134">Some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites.</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland therefore helps build a system that combines various levels of information with each other. it is intended to help FISH-i to find criminally acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that.</seg>
<seg id="139">Recently SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Organisation: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world by means of the position of each eyeable vessel.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "gather together with the neighbors to get a better image of who is doing it - that makes sense," "" "he says." "" "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for the investigation." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">"" "we should do this on a global level." "" "the Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project in which a global system allows the prosecution of ships." ""</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that used to be fished without a license and had little to reckon with consequences now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">According to Kiilu some of the countries participating in FISH-i now have a 33% increase in fishery revenues since fishing boats buy more licenses.</seg>
<seg id="145">After FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, inspectors were there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited.</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "other countries also notice these successes." "" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "" "says Kiilu." "" "we have become a study object." ""</seg>
<seg id="148">In 2015, six countries joined forces to go to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also fight illegal fishing, according to exactly the same model as FISH-i. "Safety is the aim to let more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland.</seg>
<seg id="149">Recently FISH-i's most recent member state Somalia had its first big triumph: in October Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only the ship was on the road without a licence and were used towing nets which are now banned.</seg>
<seg id="150">The ship was also invaded into forbidden waters, which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia. "with taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," says Bergh.</seg>
<seg id="151">For FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the oceans.

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on President NicolÃ¡s Maduro's resignation.</seg>
<seg id="155">This picture of MarÃ­a Alejandra Mora shows a close-up of the demonstration in Maracaibo in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="157">After the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition's request to a referendum on the term of office, Venezuelans, in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emptiness, gathered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (e.g.: the refund of Venezuela) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found.</seg>
<seg id="159">The debate is also conducted in other parts of the country - including the Barinas lowland area, in the Andes-regions MÃ©rida and TÃ¡chira, in the central-north of the Carabobo federal state and on the Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta.</seg>
<seg id="160">The political and economic situation of the country is constantly worsening, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans by an acute shortage of food and medicine.</seg>
<seg id="161">Many representatives of the opposition saw the chance of a fundamental change in the removal of the current President NicolÃ¡s Maduro, but ultimately the holding of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities.</seg>
<seg id="162">Marianne DÃ­az, co-acting with Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="163">As part of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence rate are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on the removal of many as the only way to regain the country's institutional structures and to close a new government alliance.</seg>
<seg id="164">The electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad DemocrÃ¡tica or short MUD (e.g.: round Table of Democratic Unity), in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly in 2015. in addition, a 12-hour strike on the following day and a march to the Miraflores Palace, the Venezuelan government seat, scheduled to continue on 3 November.</seg>
<seg id="165">The appeal was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:</seg>
<seg id="166">It is as far as Venezuela: tomorrow National Assembly, Friday countrywide civil strike and on November 3 all after Caracas to the Miraflores Palace.</seg>

<seg id="176">On Twitter images that tell of confrontations are piling up as well as reports of oppression and abuse.</seg>
<seg id="177">Especially large waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Maracay.</seg>
<seg id="178">There the demonstrators went back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed supporters of the government according to their own statement.</seg>
<seg id="179">Hours later they could safely leave the cathedral, but the protests continued.</seg>
<seg id="180">In other parts of the country, some demonstrators tried to stop the police forces, including this woman in the Andean State of TÃ¡chira:</seg>
<seg id="181">The women in TÃ¡chira do not wear a skirt, because otherwise you could see something that many national gardeners don't have!</seg>
<seg id="182">Meanwhile, an infographic already makes the round, which forms the extent of repression per day:</seg>
<seg id="183">Thus the dictatorship has suppressed the country.</seg>
<seg id="184">Many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the streets.</seg>

<seg id="197">This is an adapted version of an interview by Alejo GÃ³mez and Luis Quijano, which was published on 23 August 2016 on DÃ­a a DÃ­a, an Argentinean news site.</seg>
<seg id="198">The interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="199">When he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities of La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinian city of CÃ³rdoba.</seg>
<seg id="200">In the course of the great La Perla-Ribera process in the province of Cordoba, Quijano is now an adult man in the province of Cordoba against his father.</seg>
<seg id="201">In the trial which ended on 24 August 2016, crimes committed during the Argentinean military dictatorship were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">Beginning with the burden of wearing the same name as his father, up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Perla, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough.</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he retained the family secret.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time, I believed that was all right.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="207">As a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father.</seg>
<seg id="208">At that time, I could not see that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer.</seg>
<seg id="209">Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was a police officer. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was deputy commander of the Secret Service Department 141 at La Perla prison.</seg>
<seg id="210">Luis Alberto Quijano.</seg>

<seg id="212">But this is not the story of Luis Quijano, the oppressor who is accused of kidnapping in 158 cases, torture, murder in almost 100 cases and the kidnapping of a 10-year-old child.</seg>
<seg id="213">No, this is the story of Luis Quijanos son, a man who, over the years, recognized the extent of the atrocities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a Federal Supreme Court against his own father.</seg>
<seg id="214">His story shows which great power has a parent about his child and how this child chose a way of salvation.</seg>
<seg id="215">From the sports hall to the military base</seg>
<seg id="216">When my father started to take me to the military base, I often went to the sports hall. there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts.</seg>
<seg id="217">All called him "Kent."</seg>
<seg id="218">I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it.</seg>
<seg id="219">He said:</seg>
<seg id="220">You are an asshole, you have made friends with an ERP.</seg>
<seg id="221">Pass only that they will not take you one day and I have to save you.</seg>
<seg id="222">The abbreviation ERP stands for EjÃ©rcito Revolucionario del Pueblo, - Revolutionary People's Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers "party of Argentina.</seg>
<seg id="223">So he forbade me to go back to the sports hall. a few days later he took me to work on the military base.</seg>
<seg id="224">He told me that I would become a secret agent.</seg>
<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine. for so my father had raised me.</seg>
<seg id="226">At the base of the military base I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners.</seg>
<seg id="227">These were all possible documents: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything.</seg>

<seg id="230">My father took me a total of four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">When he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barrack, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - everything possible - stood.</seg>
<seg id="233">All of it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">He gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big clump of silver in it.</seg>
<seg id="235">On that day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were parked and chatted with a guard.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">I went in and saw a couch that people were tortured.</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that they fixed the one end of a cable. the other end was fastened to the body of the person who had just been captivated there.</seg>

<seg id="301">I guess it was simply decided to kill these people, but why would their bodies disappear?</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families that could be handed over to their mortal remnants?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpses is the last atrocious act that one can do to a man.</seg>

<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Adaptation of the original pictures by Joshua Levine, widely shared in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">The mistake was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers.</seg>
<seg id="352">The daily Kyoto Shimbun, published in Kyoto, wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could it come to such an English translation?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"" "this is an insult to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable," "" "said Holmes." ""</seg>
<seg id="356">The faulty English translation was initially removed. the name "terrible drivers" was later replaced by the appropriate, if also grammatically not quite correct term "elder drivers" (German: "older drivers").</seg>
<seg id="357">The police of the Kyoto prefecture did not apologise for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the bug was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published.</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"" "" "" "we are very sorry that older people felt offended by the insufficient correction (translation) on our part," "" "said the police." ""</seg>
<seg id="360">Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News talked a little more about the phenomenon of "terrible" elderly drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">The word "awful" was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists who are nationally involved in accidents is a cause for concern.</seg>
<seg id="362">In the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005, which corresponds to a 10% share.</seg>
<seg id="363">Ten years later, in 2014, senior citizens created 1,803 of a total of 11,850 accidents.</seg>
<seg id="364">Thus their share rose to 17.7%.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the widespread dissemination of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">For translating, one needs two important skills: passive voice knowledge to understand the source text and active language skills to transfer it to the target language.</seg>
<seg id="378">The latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - not in the source language - native speakers.</seg>
<seg id="379">For example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French, not from French into English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">Many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of native speakers who learn Japanese.</seg>
<seg id="382">Some companies who do not have foreign employees do not leave translations internally. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really.</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">The confused and enigmatic sentences created by mechanical translations show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages.</seg>
<seg id="386">Some of the strangest British formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints that often decorate t-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood.</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but from large companies or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future, the city of Kyoto has hopefully used a better source for its translations.</seg>

<seg id="391">Main page of the portal "Navegar con Libertad" (Free Surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society).</seg>
<seg id="392">On Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the online broadcaster Vivoplay.</seg>
<seg id="393">Later, other users wrote that the internet presentations of VPITV and El Capitolio TV were no longer accessible.</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also recorded recordings of the protests in Caracas, which were organized by opposition groups opposing the government NicolÃ¡s Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">The protests began in the beginning of April after the Supreme Court disbanded the Parliament and had transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself.</seg>
<seg id="396">Luis Carlos DÃ­az, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was taped, and recommended users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="397"># Zensur: enable your VPN.</seg>
<seg id="398">It seems that Internet pages of Venezuelan providers have been closed again.</seg>
<seg id="399">This is from the page of @ VivoPlayNet.</seg>
<seg id="400">Offers such as Vivoplay are popular among the Venezuelan users with Internet access, especially in times of turbulences.</seg>
<seg id="401">Traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations, as the Commission considered this as a call for violence.</seg>
<seg id="402">Without cable TV and informative national TV channels, I registered again at @ vivoplaynet.</seg>
<seg id="403">It's amazing that it is still cheaper than buying two liters of lemonade.</seg>
<seg id="404">The local NGO VEsensifiltro later confirmed that not only Vivoplay was inaccessible by blocking the domain name system (DNS), but also two other online channels. this also applies to the website where the National Assembly transfers its meetings.</seg>
<seg id="405">Previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had shown that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS. this is a technique by which the DNS server requests certain domains error-prone.</seg>
<seg id="406">If a website is blocked by the DNS, the server responds correctly or refuses to request such a website.</seg>
<seg id="407">We confirm a DNS lock: @ elcapitoliotv, @ VPITV and @ vivoplaynet</seg>
<seg id="408">At VPITV, a third blocked channel, the broadcast was suspended on Thursday, 6 April, when the VPITV camera man Elvis Flores, who carried the protests in Caracas live, was put into custody.</seg>
<seg id="409">Flores was beaten while he was in police custody.</seg>
<seg id="410">Eight hours later he was released, and VPITV went on stream again.</seg>
<seg id="411">Although some channels are still accessible via YouTube, it was also reported that the government regulates the internet connections: this makes the Venezuelans more difficult access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country.</seg>

<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the home again and heard how the owner of the house was proud of her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"" "she said." "" "she said." ""</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">When she was ten years old she began to work as a Criadita for the family. in Paraguay the more than 46.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school.</seg>
<seg id="423">The shop is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their age-old son or her minor daughter to another, wealthier family. in exchange, the child gets food, training and a roof over the head.</seg>
<seg id="424">What is not mentioned, however, is that the children must pay countless days of housework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse can be - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted.</seg>
<seg id="425">This practice described as Criadazgo is widespread in Paraguay because of its participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints from human rights organizations.</seg>
<seg id="426">After graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls.</seg>
<seg id="427">She spoke with Criaditas, especially young girls who were affected by the practice of the Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced.</seg>
<seg id="428">She tried to name the things by name, because the feeling of gratitude inoculated by the Criadia guarantees in general silence.</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," Alvarenga explains.</seg>
<seg id="430">On the one hand, the family, who is their daughter in the belief that they complete their education, improve their position in society and make "something out of itself," passes over to another family.</seg>
<seg id="431">On the other hand, the family who takes the girl with him and justifies his exploitation with the faith that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even starved.</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of the Criadazgo</seg>

<seg id="434">Sometimes they never know about it.</seg>

<seg id="436">When Carolina MarÃ­n came to hospital in CaaguazÃº, her body showed traces of violent strokes. shortly thereafter she died.</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">She was Criadita in the household of the former military family TomÃ¡s Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as an official at the registration office.</seg>
<seg id="439">MarÃ­n lived with them in their house in VaquerÃ­a, a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital AsunciÃ³n.</seg>
<seg id="440">At the end of January 2016, Ferreira defeated MarÃ­n as long as she suffered lethal injuries.</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations like UNICEF or Callescuela did the practice of Criadazgo, rooted in the Paraguayan society, responsible for the death of the girl.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be "no other Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," Tina Alvarenga complained.</seg>
<seg id="449">Without documents it is much easier to violate the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">They want TomÃ¡s Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl who was her Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="453">If the case comes to court, the case of Carolina MarÃ­n might be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court.</seg>
<seg id="454">Everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">The Criaditas are not only exploited as labour power, they also live isolated from other girls at their age.</seg>
<seg id="456">Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik in which her father worked, bankrupt and her father lost his work.</seg>
<seg id="457">Their brothers now had to work all work and began to sell sweets on the street or market in order to make money.</seg>

<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital AsunciÃ³n as Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">In the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day.</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She stood up every morning at five o'clock and prepared breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">Fridays, for example, cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor.</seg>
<seg id="464">When the school was over, she went home again and had time for learning.</seg>
<seg id="465">The more she finished learning, the more free time she had.</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="467">Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but also didn't get unlimited food. "I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as food from the fridge," she remembers.</seg>
<seg id="468">The library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party, who was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 to 1989.</seg>
<seg id="469">At some evenings the landlord Alvarenga forced to stand next to him and read editorials of opposition newspapers such as "Sendero" or "El Pueblo."</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to convince her to not believe in the reports of the official media about the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "he thought she was intelligent, but did not refrain with her." "" "the master had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="472">"" "" "" "they didn't allow me to visit my family because they thought I would" "" "learn bad habits" "" "there again." "" "they thought that Alvarenga, who belongs to the Indigenous group of GuaranÃ­, would speak back home her native language GuaranÃ­." ""</seg>
<seg id="473">Their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible for them.</seg>
<seg id="474">But she was completely clear that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work.</seg>
<seg id="475">Also at school, Alvarenga was discriminated against. "one thing that is almost never spoken is bullying and the chicanes who are exposed to Criadita when they go to school.</seg>
<seg id="476">Because the other children have parents, they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents is a criadita.</seg>
<seg id="477">I couldn't invite anybody to my home. I didn't have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="478">In my youth, in the time when friendships develop, I felt particularly clear that I was not one of a group.</seg>

<seg id="525">High up in the Kurdistan mountains in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protection worker Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghostly Persian leopards.</seg>
<seg id="526">A subspecies of the leopards that crosses Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less loot.</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this certain kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">As Raza shows in the video, "Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" and the health and flourishing of the ecosystem also depends on a big predator.</seg>
<seg id="529">The chance to see a Persian leopard in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video states that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera trap, Raza breaks out in pure joy.</seg>
<seg id="530">As a trained biologist, Raza passionately likes to show another side of her country, which consists not only of war and conflict.</seg>
<seg id="531">She has been involved in field studies on wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years.</seg>
<seg id="532">She has been a member of the IUCN / SSC Cat Specialist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protected areas are set up for wild animals in the Kurdistan region.</seg>

<seg id="538">Six years after the tsunami: the state of affairs in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="539">"view from Shizugawa High School to Shizugawa, Minami Sanriku (Miyagi)."</seg>
<seg id="540">Shizugawa was destroyed by the tsunami on 11 March 2011 and the region is still busy rebuilding.</seg>

<seg id="544">At the beginning of March 2017, the newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, who was responsible for the northeast of Japan, reached the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those affected by the "triple catastrophe" in March 2011. a massive earthquake, a tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima triggered the catastrophe.</seg>
<seg id="545">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a fair prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami.</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring councillors Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated, because tsunami had let entire coastal cities disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">The Fukushima prefecture also experienced a nuclear accident, and that's why 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone.</seg>
<seg id="548">From a local point of view, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows which progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the life of local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains statistics from the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results for those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">The apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate</seg>
<seg id="551">The Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (beekeeping, saigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="552">Miyagi had the biggest success among the three prefectures, here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed.</seg>
<seg id="553">Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent.</seg>
<seg id="554">Nevertheless, one still strives to relocate for six years after the catastrophe, evacuation of accommodation shelters (to beekeeping, Kazetsu juutaku) into final replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="555">After the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people saw themselves forced to live in accommodation shelters.</seg>
<seg id="556">In December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes.</seg>
<seg id="557">Nearly 40 per cent of the Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters whereas Miyagi was more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated evacuated after the disaster in accommodation shelters were resettled into final houses.</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate, the number is 34 percent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The status of work and everyday life in the three affected prefectures</seg>
<seg id="560">Like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1100 schools that were affected by misfortune have opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for nearly 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures.</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later, it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">While nearly 100 percent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are in operation again, only 30 percent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="563">The tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected agricultural land in the three prefectures of agricultural land.</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">It is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land cultivated by Fukushima lie in the "nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">In two of the three prefectures, tourism has largely recovered, but also here Fukushima remains far beaten back.</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent on the same level as before misfortune. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit 75 percent.</seg>
<seg id="568">However, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal population, it is more difficult to earn their livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next major earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">In order to determine an overall picture, the newspaper has conducted numerous surveys among the local population and the evacuates. she questioned her about the status of reconstruction and also how her empire has changed compared to the tsunami risk.</seg>
<seg id="571">In her introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey showed that 83.1 percent of local residents took measures to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">However, 55.9 percent of respondents think that still not enough in disaster prevention has been done.</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to evacuate from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In her edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">Fukushima had to experience not only the massive earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed.</seg>
<seg id="578">Almost 63 000 people from Fukushima evacuated from Fukushima to areas outside the prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="579">At the beginning of 2016 some more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, have been resettled in permanent replacement houses.</seg>
<seg id="580">According to the state of 2017 there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture.</seg>
<seg id="581">In the catastrophes most of the evacuates, who still live in Behel-shelters, older than 50 years old, are known to fail because the efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima have to compete with massive construction projects. this is building projects that are part of the Olympic Games which will take place in Tokyo by 2020.</seg>

<seg id="583">When one encounters people from other countries speaking another language, the differences seem to be greater first than the similarities.</seg>
<seg id="584">After a while, however, one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="585">These global links are important as they challenge our prejudices, expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this episode of Into the Deep, the Global Voices Podcast, we look closely at these global links. in our Into the Deep podcast we deal with topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve.</seg>
<seg id="587">We speak with five Global Voices members who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected with someone beyond language and country borders.</seg>
<seg id="588">Veroniki Krikoni talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish; Tori Egherman explains how the love for music overlooks the lack of common language skills during a journey in rural China; Adriana Macias talks about the time when she worked with people from all over the world in London; and Joey Ayoub looks back on his experiences he has collected in a small village in Madagascar.</seg>

<seg id="596">Mateus Ferreira da Silva, who studies social sciences at the University of GoiÃ¡s, has suffered a skull brain trauma and several fractures.</seg>

<seg id="626">With the introduction of the Ãlvaro Reynoso law, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba closed doors (photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="627">The community Gregorio ArleÃ© MaÃ±alich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as the Central - Spanish Sugar Mill, notwithstanding that there is no appreciable sugar harvesting on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">After the harvest, the sugar cane industry in the region stood still, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the smells of steel and concrete remained.</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resigned and commuting daily to the factories still grinding.</seg>
<seg id="633">Nene, a soldier's veteran, who runs every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not rob his sleep.</seg>
<seg id="634">He heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation after a long inactive period because they were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something that he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">Nene recalls exactly that in MaÃ±alich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept.</seg>
<seg id="637">The sugar cane industry already resisted plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions, and climate change.</seg>
<seg id="638">In 2016 production was 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910.</seg>
<seg id="639">The news would have been a subject of concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore.</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated, and they were hardly competitive for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">The initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production goal was 4 million tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="645">They only left the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives which led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">Nevertheless, the sugar price rose once more than a decade ago.</seg>
<seg id="649">From 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound must remain, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and FAO, the United Nations Agricultural and Food Organisation.</seg>
<seg id="650">If the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country.</seg>
<seg id="651">Not everything went well</seg>
<seg id="652">"" "" "" "today's day will come into history with security," "" "these were the first words of Cuban President Fidel Castro in his speech on October 21, 2002 in the sugar factory in Lavandero." ""</seg>
<seg id="653">From then on, the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry.</seg>
<seg id="654">In the following years, the shutdown of a total of 98 sugar cane factories, more than 65 million people received their full salary for further training.</seg>
<seg id="655">The same happened in the sugar cane factory Gregorio ArlÃ©e MaÃ±alich on May 14, 2004.</seg>
<seg id="656">Luis Alberto PÃ©rez has worked in the factory since 1967.</seg>
<seg id="657">If Nene, as he is known as a soldier, speaks about the closure of the factory, the word he is most repeating is "scam."</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are in the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">In order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group.</seg>
<seg id="660">Before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come.</seg>
<seg id="661">These documents were officially recorded, which differed only with regard to the parts that would be removed, the address sat and the date.</seg>
<seg id="662">All were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal.</seg>
<seg id="663">From then on, the responsibility was postponed and the letters came more and more frequently.</seg>
<seg id="664">Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the discontinued factory for two years and he was one who received the letters. "the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation," he asserts.</seg>
<seg id="665">Eddy Reyes, 64 years old, is waiting for retirement in another complex, the Boris Luis Santa Coloma.</seg>

<seg id="690">Recording a song from "Home to Me" - Grassy Narrows First Nation.</seg>
<seg id="691">Photo taken with permission of N'we Jinan.</seg>
<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities throughout Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them. they do so with hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">As part of the N'we Jinan tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios directly to schools and youth centres since 2014 to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances.</seg>
<seg id="694">The original workshops were conducted by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked together in Nord-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars.</seg>
<seg id="695">The workshop thus increases that the young participants in conversations like "cultural identity, language, conflict, love, self-acceptance," or whatever comes to mind.</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos where young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">Because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the State of Nebraska.</seg>
<seg id="698">This video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the territory of the KKitschkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the history of Highway 16, also called "Highway of tears," a street section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered.</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were largely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to mediate how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs is, despite the influences of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">Many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although young people do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations.</seg>
<seg id="702">In the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the chorus will be sung at Cree.</seg>
<seg id="703">The young people involved got some help from Gary Jolly of the Northstars hip-hop group who gave them a verse in Eastern James Bay Cree dialect.</seg>
<seg id="704">On the Facebook page of N'we Jinan the verse is available in transcription, as is a translation into English, which is translated into German:</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day you will hear our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we as a youth have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">So they can grow and move forward as much as our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what the Creator has decreed for</seg>
<seg id="713">In the commentary box, the reader and advocate of Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also makes a contribution and adds the verse in syllable (which is also published on his blog and published here with permission):</seg>

<seg id="718">In Japan you can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="719">In order to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, are exhibited near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (of the food, "plastic models of the dishes") from each dish served in this restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry devoted to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">In the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a number of small businesses that produce just those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">For most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend transforms them today into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets.</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new plastic trays decorated with plastic ribbons as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">Many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collection objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are a few Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food demand is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">In this case, an awning-don (a popular rice bowl with seafood) was turned into a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile support.</seg>
<seg id="731">We also produced this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that captures your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">Designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is a great design.</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">Some mobile phone stands and mobile phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon roe is used, a popular topping served with white rice.</seg>
<seg id="736">On Twitter, some users had their doubts:</seg>
<seg id="737">"" "is there anyone who would say:" "" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile phone with salmon roe?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I will be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take on a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">In addition, there are also paddy balls (Onigiri), earrings and handybands made of dried salmon.</seg>
<seg id="742">For more bizarre plastic dishes you can look at: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow on twitter the hashtag # for selections.</seg>
<seg id="743">If you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry.</seg>

<seg id="749">In reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious "struggle against drug trafficking" in Mexico, the extremists and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails.</seg>
<seg id="750">Reporting on drugs bosses like El Chapo GuzmÃ¡n, head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict perfectly into the background.</seg>
<seg id="751">The day after a violent incident hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the communities that have learned to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="752">Behind every body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed.</seg>
<seg id="753">This is why the Mexican news portal Animal PolÃ­tico summoned the digital project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" (German: "living with drug trafficking"), telling these victims a voice and telling stories of people who were engaged in the struggle between law enforcement agencies and cartels.</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal PolÃ­tico describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are far more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">For example, when businesses close because they are threatened by drug dealers and have to drive entire communities for so many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk.</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "a video entitled" "" "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" "" "(German:" "" "how fear lives" "" ") tells exactly these stories." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">A main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for secret tombs every weekend according to his son.</seg>
<seg id="761">Or Emma Veleta RodrÃ­guez, who lost her father only one day, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews.</seg>
<seg id="762">"" "priests:" "" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and search for graves, according to the people we have loved." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="774">"" "" "" "we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership." ""</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">KYHB, a reader of Animal PolÃ­tico, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="778">Their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known illness and sensational journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the title pages with images that can only come from a textbook for criminology or files from specialists.</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">No, it's not normal that my 10 year old cousin thinks he wants to be Narco (German: drug dealers) if he's great. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the "heroic deeds" of the offenders when they go through the streets.</seg>
<seg id="786">For me it's as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who have fear that something happens to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">The insomnia of human beings is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the enforced disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified by being "" "" soaring up "" "." "" "</seg>
<seg id="789">I think they are trying to admit that they are spared from such tragedies when they do not stir and are still.</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months blackmail in the Capital District: as a family has been sacked with threats," she describes how armed criminals were forced to spend money from her business month after month, until they had not only destroyed the business but had torn her family apart.</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you've lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">The pain about it never passes, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone.</seg>
<seg id="793">Habits changed, phone numbers also.</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">The farther we are from each other, the better.</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">We want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you.</seg>
<seg id="798">In these terrible days I asked myself if tears would dissolve my deep rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain.</seg>
<seg id="799">"" "journalist Mario GutiÃ©rrez Vega published the article" "" "The Forgotten Kids of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez: a Generation of Violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">What is it like to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous town of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">He is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them.</seg>
<seg id="803">Bryan is an orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg, make potatoes, make tortillas warm and make "Chichi" for the babies who live with him. this is his name for the preparation of the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder.</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">When he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">His childhood was past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, who had been shot by armed men from a passing car.</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born, the situation in JuÃ¡rez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in JuÃ¡rez.</seg>
<seg id="811">In 2008, 2009 and 2010 JuÃ¡rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Citizens Council for Public Security and the Government of the United States Government.</seg>
<seg id="812">In 2010 alone, the public prosecutor amounted to 3103 murders. this corresponds to 8.5 murders per day.</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">In addition to the project "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco," Animal PolÃ­tico has launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to show the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country over the last four decades in an understandable way.</seg>
<seg id="816">If a picture is worth a thousand unreal words</seg>

<seg id="818">The fact-check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting up a rumor or exposing a fake.</seg>
<seg id="819">But how is the year after something has emerged the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to continue to exist.</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">Since its first release, it has been misleading to portray tragedies that have actually taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="822">This false link between image and event - "wrong description" or "wrong context" in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is plenty of careful reporting about events in DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to messages.</seg>
<seg id="824">What Happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">In 2010, a tank car crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, piled around and exploded. 230 people died here.</seg>
<seg id="826">After the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected and devastated for years. the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to drive.</seg>
<seg id="827">Tragically, the tank truck fell victim to the victim.</seg>
<seg id="828">Representatives of the authorities described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses, including a cinema close to people who were full of people who looked at the football world championship.</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were incinerated to ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="831">A picture entitled "This is Nigeria." by the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, 12th January 2015.Several photos of the incident make up the horrible scenes of this day.</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while people look at them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">Over the years, the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">On 3 January 2015, Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian villages of Baga and Doro Gowon.</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported drastically about atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">There were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were slaughtered.</seg>
<seg id="841">"" "but the figures could not be confirmed." "" "no one remained behind to count corpses," "" "said a local man to Human Rights Watch." ""</seg>
<seg id="842">Many were dismembered, shot or burned.</seg>
<seg id="843">The follow-up time was only shown on the basis of satellite images.</seg>
<seg id="844">The reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army protector in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015).</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from the DR Congo resurfaced again, as it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">A massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris.</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">In fact, this misuse of the image from DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented access to Nigeria since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="851">In all these cases the picture was presented as a cover for mass killings.</seg>
<seg id="852">Even one step further forward personal comments such as this example falsely falsify the image from DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments.</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">According to a flash, published by the United Nations, those who managed to flee were beating punches, rape and some dead, some by burning.</seg>
<seg id="855">While others reported on the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:</seg>
<seg id="856">This picture comes from an Arabic-Arab news page that falsely claimed President Myanmar's Thein Being said that monks and politicians would have participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to illustrate this information.</seg>
<seg id="857">The original contribution, which was recently accessed on 26 April 2017, can be accessed here.</seg>
<seg id="858">Other news organizations that called AFP as their source also wrongly attributed Thein to this statement, but had not related the image from the DR Congo.</seg>

<seg id="927">Frames and Pictures</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong themes or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the murders of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is undervalued in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">To understand religion and the value of human life is important both. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts.</seg>
<seg id="932">However, a deeper question is what happens if readers can no longer believe these images.</seg>
<seg id="933">There are many people with social media who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy.</seg>
<seg id="934">Suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and does the actual horror of what actually happened in DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?</seg>
<seg id="935">The distribution of violent images has been debated extensively (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">One argument is that refusing images of a refusal to recognise the tragedy. sometimes these pictures are even required by the victims themselves.</seg>
<seg id="937">At the same time, there is a concern that violent images are desensitizing readers and viewers and taking the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study which investigated how violent media act on helping others).</seg>
<seg id="938">While there is a lot to discuss with regard to violent representations in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting.</seg>
<seg id="939">Technologists are experimenting with algorithms in order to support the fight against "fake news." they will have to think thoroughly about situations in which a picture suggests something, which can actually also be replaced by the context or in a completely missive way.</seg>
<seg id="940">However, each examination of false attributions should also take into account how international they can be.</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e.g. insurmountable) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">Such words exist in every language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these irreplaceable words are already well-known (like the famous Portuguese saudades) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture (for example Spanish Soboresa).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist persistent every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">A word or expression does not suffice, which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant with this one word.</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">Most of these lists deal with Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of "untranslatable" Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages.</seg>
<seg id="951">For example, in the blog you can find words from Vanuatu's Mwotlap language, such as:</seg>
<seg id="952">"vakasteglok" - take care of your parents in recognition of how you have been working for you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">And words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil like:</seg>
<seg id="954">"kwadi" - The comfort or laziness that you feel after you have warmed up in the sun during cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog about:</seg>
<seg id="956">They unveil other cultures, reveal other thoughts and arouse our curiosity.</seg>
<seg id="957">Sometimes you influence how we analyze the world around us and classify the linguists on this page want to publish even more of these "irreplaceable" words and show how different, valuable and impressive these small languages are.</seg>
<seg id="958">Speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are highly appreciated by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite speakers here.</seg>

<seg id="971">Triggered by the monsoon, which usually begins at the end of May, the rivers Kalu, Kelani, Gin, Nilwala and Attanagalu Oya have stepped over the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country.</seg>
<seg id="972">After an opinion of the catastrophes centre of Sri Lanka of 28 May 2017, 126 people were killed and scarcely hundreds of people were missed because of the floods and sludge.</seg>
<seg id="973">Over 400,000 people have been affected since last Friday (26 May) and about 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations.</seg>
<seg id="974">The rain falls on Saturday (27 May), and the water levels in some areas decreased slowly.</seg>
<seg id="975">The health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still inaccessible areas.</seg>
<seg id="976">The following images and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster:</seg>
<seg id="977">High water in Tawalama City with water stands of up to 7.5 meters. Twitter users like Azzam Ameen and Sri Lanka Tweet deliver regular updates to the flood situation.</seg>

<seg id="980">This morning, the Neluwa bus was in the high water, water level up to 6 meters. village Moragoda near Galle also flooded because of the water level of the Morogoda Ela.</seg>
<seg id="981">The Air Force has provided five aircraft for rescue operations and another five are made for the transportation of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages.</seg>
<seg id="982">Various organizations and startups are also ready to help.</seg>

<seg id="988">The taxi call app PickMe (Sri Lanka) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster center will be informed.</seg>
<seg id="989">Last year after the disaster of the Roanu Tropical Storm, PickMe launched a "flood control" button that allowed users to call a vehicle to collect assistance and donations. these were then redirected to the Sri Lankan Red Cross for free.</seg>
<seg id="990">They also launched a "SOS" button, which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boatrescue operations for people included in flooding water and landslides.</seg>

<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We don't all look like that.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">We identify ourselves with being a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all plugged into the same Muslim drawer.</seg>
<seg id="1009">This drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims, who as I do not fit in there, become Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1010">To be Muslim</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone.</seg>

<seg id="1027">This narrative fails to recognise that if French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and Saudi-Arab, Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body, which are both sides of the same coin.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>

<seg id="1033">Because of these stories we tell and because of the way we tell them, Islamophobia is today not just fear of Islam, religion, but fear of the "other."</seg>

<seg id="1120">They have grown exponentially, because they have made Muslims "others."</seg>
<seg id="1121">There is another group that has grown exponentially by creating the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1122">A few years before, it had not yet been given; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="1123">I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as my daughter is now, but who today made me an irrepressible Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Things I left here like a breadcrumb line in my speech.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Things that might awaken memories, for in all the intersections that make up our humanity, a story may lurk where someone is made "another."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Right now, on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley, conversations are held at the 8th Annual Conference on Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="1127">More than a hundred academics talk about our problems with the "other," "structural racism" and "American militarism."</seg>

<seg id="1130">We all have to ask ourselves why?</seg>
<seg id="1131">Why do I tell this here at this TEDx Talk 2017 in Stanford, where Edward Said, the man who showed us how wars will be led and people will be enthralled by creating the "other" in the public presentation, four decades ago became a scientist of Stanford.</seg>
<seg id="1132">We have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of what my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women's March, because the employment that we have no president, the chocolate cake, while he bombed already broken countries and "to other made" people goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion.</seg>

<seg id="1134">Initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity</seg>
<seg id="1135">Storytelling stories, by Flickr-users Daniele Rossi, using the license CC BY-NC-ND 2.0.</seg>
<seg id="1136">Can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier?</seg>
<seg id="1137">For Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling initiative (TLS), the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Global Voices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird, the irreplaceable blog.</seg>
<seg id="1139">Here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities.</seg>
<seg id="1140">In fact, in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oakland in the United States, where TLS has had events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages will not be passed on to the children born there.</seg>
<seg id="1141">The following applies to the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass mortality of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents do not have to forget who they are to belong to.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"" "while" "" "listening is often associated with it," "" "uses these events instead to" "" "listen to appreciate, feel, tie." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format, storytellers first introduce their story in their own language and then translate or explain them in English.</seg>
<seg id="1145">Even if the participants are not a professional storyteller, their dedication and presentation lead to the audience being listened to.</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotion as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">The following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language of Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassimetou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art typical for her country.</seg>
<seg id="1148">In another event John Nyamara tells the tale of the hare and the baboon in the language Shona from Zimbabwe:</seg>
<seg id="1149">"" "after explaining the importance of his parable, John Nyamusara is asked:" "" "how is that to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language?" "" "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:" ""</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">So far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling took place in three cities, and the organizers hope to extend this. all those who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own storytelling shows.</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the United States to reestablish public debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">With the aim of reviewing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration last 3 April 2017. the march started at the puertorial Capitol, the government building of the capital, and went up to the Plaza de ColÃ³n in the old city of San Juan.</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la AuditorÃ­a de la Deuda" (civil front for the neural examination of debts) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Rico.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the renewal of the debt have also filed a petition on the official website of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their claim:</seg>
<seg id="1159">The people of Puerto Rico claim that politicians, bankers and government officials responsible for debt are being held accountable for their corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1160">"" "" "" "we call for a financial audit and a Steering Committee without any personal interests in public debts, with a fixed remuneration that acts in favour of the economy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Rico refused to pay a debt which is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with sinking pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not in the US sovereign territory - suffers from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Hence the so-called "Centre for New Economy," an non-governmental non-profit organization without party affiliation with focus on socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority.</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>

<seg id="1182">The Syrian-Palestinian web developer Bassel Khartabil, also known as Bassel Safadi, has been missing for over a year.</seg>
<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">More than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he has provided for an open network.</seg>
<seg id="1185">At this year's re: Publica, the annual conference on digital culture aimed at Berlin, an event dedicated to the # FreeBassel campaign was dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="1186">MÃ©lanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the resident CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara RÃ¼hling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publisher of books produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read extracts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The cost of freedom: a collective reresearch).</seg>
<seg id="1187">The book published last year and is freely available here contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it means:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what is the real cost to which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">Activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create a sense of our various experiences.</seg>
<seg id="1192">This book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and acclaimed Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was deleted from the directory of the Adra prison in which he sat on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then, we have no information on its current state or whereabouts.</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book, entitled "Collective Memories," gives his friends and his family a voice to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and in freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has allowed many of us to start thinking about their own fate, actions and decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we abandoned in this process of temporary extreme convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital activist has been in the custody of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">In October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, to an unknown place.</seg>
<seg id="1202">His wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the "Military Police of Bassel had taken the basis of a" strictly secret "command of the military tribunal in his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she had been contacted by people on November 12, 2015 who presented themselves as an insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">However, his whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">A pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding the access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1206">Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and at the moment the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of the bassels was more provisionary than the work he began with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras.</seg>
<seg id="1208">Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here merges Greek and Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Bassel could not know at that time that ten years after he began this work, the IS would put everything on it - this architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world.</seg>
<seg id="1210">This strip in digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule that will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">Tragically, Bassel could not close this project so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">I spent my entire life with dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace her.</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I have learned to read, write and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use computers as well as smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">He also taught other prisoners, how they use computers, at least theoretically, without actually having them in their hands.</seg>
<seg id="1221">Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a sample letter she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in jail.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together on the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the lyrics to him when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English.</seg>

<seg id="1248">Since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65.000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights).</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those who were arrested or disappeared under the regime by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">By 2016, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in detention according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">Today, we reiterate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mozambique: due to corruption convicted Director after release again on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">In anger, Mozambique reacted to a corruption case in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus after half of his sentence in which corruption was committed.</seg>
<seg id="1256">This is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defendants due to embezzlement of 54 million Metikal.</seg>
<seg id="1257">The money came from public funds from Mozambique airports, their advice to Cambaza between 2005 and 2008.</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately demanded his return to the company, which took place on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">In accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to resume its old post, as the company did not carry out disciplinary proceedings after his detention.</seg>
<seg id="1260">However, many people don't like the action well.</seg>
<seg id="1261">The Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade PÃºblica, short CIP), a local institution dedicated to public transparency condemned the company's decision to put the director again in an interview with Deutsche Welle:</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "" "" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a regression regarding the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP." ""</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have instituted a disciplinary procedure against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">The company apparently remained silent and did not take appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"" "EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambique social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "" "unwardly" "" ":" ""</seg>
<seg id="1266">If Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be an advisor after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had dinner.</seg>
<seg id="1267">He could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image.</seg>
<seg id="1268">But as he is incompetent, he consented to become reintegrated into the company, which he helped to cause damage.</seg>
<seg id="1269">Consequently it is obvious: Cambaza is liked to pay for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Revocally!</seg>
<seg id="1271">Bitone Viage, young Mozambique and student of political science in Brazil says the director does not possess any morals:</seg>
<seg id="1272">Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insults him I cannot believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already so massively insulted the state.</seg>
<seg id="1273">Cambaza lacks morals and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself in the state.</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible money source and the state itself has become tired of this man who was charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence.</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users wrong</seg>
<seg id="1287">"" "the Burmese word" "" "Kalar pae" "" "means chickpeas or splits." ""</seg>
<seg id="1288">Photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported</seg>
<seg id="1289">According to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network picked up their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'.</seg>
<seg id="1290">Although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective "Indian."</seg>
<seg id="1291">"" "Facebook censored the word" "" "Kalar" "" "or" "" "enbeg" "" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network." ""</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements gave the word an extremely depreciating connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">In particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as a hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="1294">But in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform.</seg>
<seg id="1295">"" "" "" "Kalar" "" "may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech." ""</seg>
<seg id="1296">The context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have expressed doubt for its use.</seg>
<seg id="1297">In addition, there are several Burmese words with basically different meanings, which have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '.</seg>
<seg id="1298">For example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splinters), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain).</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboofutzer Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">However, he asked his friends in a witty way if they knew how he could ease his back pain by making a pun.</seg>
<seg id="1302">The phrase ku la - "healing" (ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different.</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">Zin Win Htet is convinced that she will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it extinguishes all posts that were suspected of racism.</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">The automatism will not understand what you write on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What should be done instead, is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example, "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae."</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">While the action may send a strong signal to anyone who wants to spread hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long.</seg>
<seg id="1313">The experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views.</seg>
<seg id="1314">The author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' is banished from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... when I became aware of this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked.</seg>
<seg id="1316">Ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to watch, post and share content for 24 hours because the post "did not meet the Facebook community standards."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts by people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post, the author told his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example, the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook likes a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through its platform, but it doesn't work like that.</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred among the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">In addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have banned words like "faeces" or "pea curry."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts.</seg>
<seg id="1326">If they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great deal of revenue, that would be great.</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">Instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net.</seg>
<seg id="1329">Here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that contained no hate speech but were still removed:</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"" "the Burmese text reads" "" "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film." ""</seg>
<seg id="1332">Just to try out whether Facebook is removing the mail containing the word Kalar. "</seg>
<seg id="1333">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1334">"" "the post states," "" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1335">Screenshot, used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased.</seg>
<seg id="1337">Among other things, hate speech in social networks is to fuel violence in the congregations in Myanmar in addition, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to escape.</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook was criticized for his failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">But instead of censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better running to look at the context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them.</seg>

<seg id="1345">Prior to this change in the law, some members of Hindu and Muslim religious communities were held in practice, and in May 2016, brother Harrytriad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organisation (IRO), a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country, said that the state should not interfere with it, as it does not determine maturity. "</seg>
<seg id="1346">"" "this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Children's Rights Convention, the minors as," "" "defined every man under the age of 18." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">Statistics from the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, who were married to 15, were 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and with 18 were 8.1 percent.</seg>
<seg id="1348">In 2011, the statistical central office of the country confirmed that between 1997-2007 more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19.</seg>
<seg id="1349">Online petitions and social media movements, which endeavoured to abolish law on children's marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result.</seg>
<seg id="1350">Nevertheless, not everything went smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="1351">A Hindu-leader, for example, had no concerns to say to the critics of the children's marriage, that they should be condemned to take care of their own affairs. "</seg>
<seg id="1352">This kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this virtually uncomplicated thing, and at some point there was doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill of law at all.</seg>
<seg id="1353">But in the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the children's marriage - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained himself - so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"" "" "" "now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be proclaimed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators gave a status update on Facebook, which reposted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted by 35 votes in the House of Representatives and none of them voted against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">After being decided in the Senate, the draft can now become a law.</seg>
<seg id="1358">The majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws on children's marriage were finally changed.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Facebook member, Lovell Francis, who is a ministerial post in the Ministry of Education, said:</seg>
<seg id="1360">It took too much time and unnecessary talk, which has veiled the core of the matter, but do you know what? the toe-toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and that is worth almost every price.</seg>
<seg id="1361">While Abel was the opinion, it took me long enough to abolish the practice, Lara Quentrall-Thomas was overjoyed that the day had finally come:</seg>
<seg id="1362">Public Status Update on Facebook by Lara Quentrall- Thomas, which says:, Excellent news!</seg>
<seg id="1363">The law of marriage has been decreed.</seg>
<seg id="1364">Minimum age - 18, Voices - 35 for it - 0 on the other hand!!!! "</seg>
<seg id="1365">Torture Mutota, which belongs to the Women's Institute for Alternative Development (WINAD), a civil society group who spoke quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was:</seg>
<seg id="1366">The marriage-capable age in Trinidad and Tobago is now independent of the religious affiliation 18 years.</seg>
<seg id="1367">The draft for the modification of the marriage network was decided today, on 9 June 2017.</seg>
<seg id="1368">There are 41 deputies in the House of Representatives and 35 of them were present at the vote.</seg>
<seg id="1369">All deputies who were against have voted in favour of the law.</seg>
<seg id="1370">The toddlers are legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tobago.</seg>
<seg id="1371">It was a long fight (...) # childlike turret.</seg>
<seg id="1372">Many thanks to all the activists who fought him.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Congratulations.</seg>
<seg id="1374">A thank you to our deputies.</seg>
<seg id="1375">But a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Maharaj, therefore, the Secretary-General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most well-known Hindu organisation of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1376">Months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to undertake judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to have fulfilled his promise.</seg>
<seg id="1377">During the Attorney General of Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said it was quite legal if Maharaj wanted to go against the law, most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject differently.</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worml suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">Dear Sat, if we, instead of discussing the discussion as universally, in a way that can only evoke panic and arrogance, if we would say instead of talking about the problem that the state, our daughters from it protects them from being abused by large, hard-boiled men who are compared to them, "would you then be ready to continue the discussion?</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think it is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">But whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the child marriage is legal or still the norm, even though there are laws that prohibit them.</seg>

<seg id="1390">By mirroring web pages, Turkish users can again view Wikipedia content</seg>
<seg id="1391">The Wikipedia page was published on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA Copyright Law in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month now Turkey has been blocking the popular encyclopedia Wikipedia based on the crowdsourcing principle.</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day after day it becomes clearer how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the closure.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Although many technology-savvy Internet users are used to use bypass tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category.</seg>
<seg id="1397">Although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently announced in a published report by the Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Act (Nr. 5651) was adopted.</seg>
<seg id="1398">In China, Turkey is the second most well-known country in the world, when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1399">While the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and are often updated).</seg>
<seg id="1400">A solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform laid down all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralized peer-to-peer network, which is not based on the domain name system and thus makes a complete censorship difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal prohibition.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost, IPFS reports about its efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">After listening to the news (about the block of Wikipedia), we put everything in place to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the contents on a decentralized and distributed manner.</seg>
<seg id="1404">This can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org.</seg>
<seg id="1405">IPFS also announced that this step was done independently from the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is only screenshots and no Live- or dynamic versions of the website.</seg>
<seg id="1406">However, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced tr.vikiansiklopedi.org, a mirrorseite between Wikipedia, and WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirrorpages when locked in the respective country Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as collaborators with Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks "Podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">It is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror.</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attacks another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Essentially, the server will forward the request to the right Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself when locked in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and well-balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to wear a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">Today, at the age of 28, Sagar, Nepalese, strives to bring Nepalese animals to the international scene.</seg>
<seg id="1421">And his hometown next to the Chitwan National Park gives him the perfect opportunity to shoot pictures that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife.</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could better give for a passionate wildlife photographer!!</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the bank of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran away with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">My father had watched him and showed me the place on the other side of the river where the leopard was, and I immediately began to kneel pictures!!</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as fearful as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">And he should know it, for he stood by face to Tigers face to face:</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger is not disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleep time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">Also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when suddenly the King of the Buck appeared. he sat down immediately, we look at him and he stares me through the Sal trees!!</seg>
<seg id="1434">To promote the protection of wild animals Sagar places the logo "I click for conservation" (lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos.</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the advancement of Nepal's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1469">This entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India.</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been republished here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">In many parts of India, women have the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family.</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead, they use a pronouns or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">From Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as fear of the consequences should they disregard the norm.</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted by the Indian state Odisha by a fake court and violated by her family and the village community after she had addressed a married relatives with names.</seg>
<seg id="1475">The tradition of not naming their wives by names is also common among men. however, they have much less justification to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1476">In the small village of Walhe in Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and thus quickly became the main theme of the city.</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone, where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">As one of 56 clubs, which is present in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1479">Rohini Paste has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera at the disclosure of practices, such as child marriage to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and manages these clubs.</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video, which Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who do not call her husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which the women can easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Not to pronounce the names of her husbands, is a custom that they have all duly held guilty and never questioned.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not stop this is regarded as a deceitful woman, as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this round of discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">At the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name, wanted to try out at home, as it is running.</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him from now on his name.</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this confidence in the luggage Rohini started their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">Many women had never heard the word "patriarchy" before. some thought it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected.</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection, the women tried to put the discussion in motion with an exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"" "then she asked all," "" "If we cannot tell the names of our husbands, but they can call us what they want, does that mean they don't respect us?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1499">"" "should it not be equal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands on their lips," "" "says Rohini Paste from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on breaking a centuries-old tradition in which married women should never be able to pronounce the names of their husbands." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she knew only before herself during the whole exercise; another decided to release the whole frustrated frustration against him and his family by damning him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">Still in adrenaline rush about having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try at home to name their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">When her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1511">"" "another woman said," "" "Rohini meant I should do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation started out in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinnoberred dot on the forehead that shows the Ehestatus:</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred point if he did it also.</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">The other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days.</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women, the discus club is a safe place where they can share their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "" "" "we make an excursion at each discussion club." ""</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"" "I don't want women to worry about who could hear what could hear," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never said so honestly about some things, for example how our identities are attached to our husbands.</seg>
<seg id="1525">It feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur.</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have borne only Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">For most, that's okay, but some wanted to wear a salsa corta, a wide shirt over a pants, they did not dare.</seg>
<seg id="1529">After much discussion and discussion about the advantages of his own dress code, morals combined with the Saris and much more, Rohini sneered her own pair of cures (upper shirts) into a discussion round so that women could wear them.</seg>
<seg id="1530">Next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it.</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini confirms the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but then stopped telling the name of her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1534">Some, including me, make it even, but only when they are alone and there are no other family members.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing zinc red on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discus club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the catch for more freedom of movement or their own dress-choice - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">By giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman walks home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1548">Screenshot from the official Beatles YouTube channel.</seg>
<seg id="1549">On June 29th this year, the hashtag was to be found in the Japanese Twitter trend, where many fans exchanged memories and shared their appreciation for the Beatles.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The visit of the Beatles in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a reversal in the Japanese culture of the post-war period.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The first Japanese journalist, Hoshika Rumiko, who exclusively interviewed the Beatles in 1964 in London, marked the 50th anniversary of the first visit:</seg>
<seg id="1552">For just under five days the Beatles were in the country, but this was enough to let the Japanese go through.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The people here have quickly become clear that they had no choice but to receive the Beatles with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Many well-known Japanese sizes had reached their zenith when the Beatles came to Japan for the first time in 1966.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The music of the cult band is "more than just a universal language like English," said Ryuichi Isaka, president of the retail giant Seven & amp; i Holdings, the online magazine Nikkei Asian Review.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Good morning! for today the Beatles memorial day is in Japan. for the past 51 years they were here in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Even today, songs from the Beatles are sung in Japanese Karaoke bars and in English classes at Japanese secondary schools.</seg>
<seg id="1558">The kitsch of the Beatles survives everything.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Today Beatles memorial day is.</seg>
<seg id="1560">We all love Beatles in our house.</seg>
<seg id="1561">I don't know if this "Winnie the Pooh" doll should represent John Lennon or not.</seg>
<seg id="1562">And as it is for fans, Japanese naturally also make pilgrimages to the familiar places associated with the band.</seg>
<seg id="1563">If you love the Beatles, that's your 5 places you absolutely have to visit.</seg>
<seg id="1564">1) Abbey Road</seg>
<seg id="1565">2) Matthew Street (in Liverpool)</seg>
<seg id="1566">3) Strawberry Fields (New York Memorial)</seg>
<seg id="1567">4) Penny Lane</seg>
<seg id="1568">5) (from the link) The Beatles Story (Museum), Liverpool</seg>
<seg id="1569">Pilgrimages can sometimes not be bizarre enough:</seg>
<seg id="1570">Good morning together.</seg>
<seg id="1571">Today Beatles memorial day is.</seg>
<seg id="1572">Exactly today in 1966, the Beatles came to Japan for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="1573">The characters from the film K-On! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road.</seg>
<seg id="1574">The same thing we did last year.</seg>
<seg id="1575">And of course some companies use the fan base in the market, like this Ramen Shop (Japanese noodles) in Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id="1576">Good morning, here is Mutahiro Koya Ramen! the day is Beatles memorial day.</seg>
<seg id="1577">And what could this be for a day?</seg>

<seg id="1585">A new system of kidnapping of bald people for organ trafficking, probably for superstitious purposes, worries the police of ZambÃ©zia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a number of operations to stop the practice.</seg>
<seg id="1586">At the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims had been decapitated and some of the organs were removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently used to be used by the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi.</seg>
<seg id="1589">There is a local superstition that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring richness, the police spokesman of ZambÃ©zia of the BBC stated.</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time successive attacks on smart men have been registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Another group, the goal of murders for obscure purposes, is humans with albinism.</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to a mission to investigate this practice in the South African country in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1593">The persecution of people with Albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighbouring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice.</seg>

<seg id="1595">He warned those who plan to travel to the country:</seg>
<seg id="1596">Respect to bald men who travel to Mozambique are the goal of ritual attacks, the Mozambique Police warned of the latest assassinations of three men of the world because of their body parts.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Two suspects were arrested in the district of Milange, where the murders took place.</seg>
<seg id="1598">Hussene Algy Adamo, student and inhabitant of the town of Inhambane in the south of Mozambique, said that local police are already following the case:</seg>
<seg id="1599">PRM believes that the shamans are involved in the death of the bald men.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of ZambÃ©zia, for probably superstitious rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans, which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate wealth.</seg>
<seg id="1601">In recent days, three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1602">On Facebook Angela Ferreira Samantha shared the chronicle of the Bloggers poor Snaippa, indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique:</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo by Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia, which was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">This story was originally published on July 8, 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press.</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo has drawn attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was admitted to hospital for cancer of the liver.</seg>
<seg id="1630">In 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for "Subversion," after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08, a manifesto called for democratic reforms in China.</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"" "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China referred to Lius case as" "" "an internal matter" "" "and told a spokesman that he considered it" "" "not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1633">Nevertheless, China still receives calls from the international community to release the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1634">While some countries have criticised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing others have completely wiped out the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United Nations with United Nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu.</seg>
<seg id="1638">However, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated.</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway in Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister BÃ¸rge Brende refused to answer questions about Liu's release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">The relationship between China and Norway came to a standstill after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that it would ultimately have nothing to do with the decision.</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume the exports to China, as exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">After the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price.</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony, Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">On 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to immediately free Liu and his wife from house arrest and to allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants.</seg>
<seg id="1648">The top diplomat of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Lius as she shared in a statement on June 30:</seg>
<seg id="1649">At the same time, we expect China to lift up all restrictions of Mr. Lius wife and family members.</seg>
<seg id="1650">They will be able to meet and receive all the visits they wish, and be able to communicate freely with the outside world.</seg>
<seg id="1651">USA in the United States</seg>
<seg id="1652">"" "U.S. Ambassador Terry Branstad told us that the Americans" "" "wish him that he has the possibility of treatment abroad, in so far as it helps him in his recovery." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1653">A spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced on June 27 that the news agency AFP announced that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "the call of the US embassy drew a furious response from China, with the utterance of the State Department that" "" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley informed that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">Protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of its choice on which it claims according to the Chinese Constitution and legal system as well as international obligations.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The U.S. Senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a resolution in Congress to urge the Chinese government to unconditionally release Liu and his wife.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Chinese President Xi Jinping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1662">Previously, diplomatic sources reported in Beijing the news agency Reuters that China had great concerns as to whether the vortex of Liu could overshadow the visit to Hamburg.</seg>
<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">On 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum asked China to provide adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family.</seg>
<seg id="1665">Lius Advocate previously told AFP that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervise the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with somebody outside, including his lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"" "" "" "Canada calls on China to preserve its international human rights commitments, including freedom of expression, and freedom of interference for the exercise of these rights." ""</seg>
<seg id="1668">France and France</seg>
<seg id="1669">France's Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu for humanitarian reasons in a declaration on 29 June:</seg>
<seg id="1670">All the necessary measures need to be taken to ensure that Liu Xiaobo receives all the treatments it needs, regardless of where, needs. furthermore, his wife and family should have contact with him.</seg>
<seg id="1671">Although the news channel France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there will be no further information whether France will eventually receive it.</seg>
<seg id="1672">Taiwan University of Taiwan</seg>
<seg id="1673">The Council of the mainland matters in Taiwan called on China on June 27 to release Liu and to show greater tolerance to those who are using peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Taiwanese legislator Yu Mei-nu of the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called on China to allow the ailing intellectual leu to be treated in Taiwan.</seg>
<seg id="1675">Dalai Lama</seg>
<seg id="1676">The spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very worried about Liu in an explanation on June 28 and admitted that many asked him to pray for Lius's well-being.</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">It is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, more stable and prosperous China, which in turn had contributed to a more peaceful world.</seg>
<seg id="1679">I felt very moved and encouraged when I saw hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens inspired by Liu Xiaobo, who signed charter 08, which stands for democracy, freedom and rule of law in China.</seg>
<seg id="1680">Singapore: city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1681">Singapore.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid, as Singapore is recognized at international level as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">But according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore to other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"" "the blog" "" "Cavalierio" "" "accused the Minister of Justice to" "" "twist the logic" "" "to defend the existing authoritarian pursuit of power in Singapore." ""</seg>
<seg id="1695">And then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this valuable country, one hears that we are ultimately no country.</seg>
<seg id="1696">It sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty.</seg>
<seg id="1697">Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?</seg>
<seg id="1698">The reasons led by Shanmugam were not very classy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of it, he inevitably appeared undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="1699">On the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party.</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">As soon as one reaches the core of the subject, the good old lyre reappears from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, abandoned logic, since it fits better to their power.</seg>
<seg id="1702">In the end, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests with regard to our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1703">He tarnished the corresponding questions with non-answers of a rational manner.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to clarify his opinion as she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">When Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to what country belongs to our city...</seg>
<seg id="1707">In short, I don't understand anything.</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K. Shanmugam would take the trouble to elucidate this point, provided it was paid highly to be part of the government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">By publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out the criticism that one should start reading the entire address of the conference, in order to better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and no country.</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"" "when he said that Singapore was rather a" "" "city" "" "than a country," "" "he explained why the Singapore elections are so uneven even if we enjoy free and fair elections." ""</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"" "when he said that Singapore was" "" "no country," "" "he obviously did not mean it in this sense!" ""</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who, as a leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1716">At least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard that expected me - I agree with them or not, but that's another thing.</seg>
<seg id="1717">But with K. Shanmugam, member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, associates correctly and is aware of what he defends.</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review dissects the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"" "has Mr. Shanmugam committed" "" "a bad faith" "" "or was it a joyous advocate?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1720">When Singapore is not a country, we are considered to be an independent and sovereign state?</seg>
<seg id="1721">If not, what country does the sovereign rights of Singapore go back?</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique, it is equally country and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">Since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, Mr Shanmugam's statements are of serious importance.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Why do the people of Singapore afford their military service, they only defend their city, but not their country?</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">The journal Journey of a Decade adds to the affirmation of Singapore and was always a city:</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I didn't say what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"" "I can understand that we often hear statements like" "" "defense of the country above all" "", "but that is not quite correct." ""</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">Their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series, with rumors about certain parts of the world to be revealed and another facet is to be shown.</seg>
<seg id="1741">The latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, editor for Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan.</seg>
<seg id="1742">"" "the question asked most in Japan is:" "" "are you Americans?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1743">"" "" "" "no, sorry," "" "I answer." "" "I'm from Canada." "" "since 1994 I live and again in Japan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1744">Depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions.</seg>
<seg id="1745">My clarification usually follows the standard answer: "Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature." many Canadians may cook inner fury when they are held for Americans, but I don't mind that.</seg>
<seg id="1746">For someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that Canadians differentiate from Americans.</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All of Canadians love.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans, on the other hand,....</seg>
<seg id="1750">So it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11.</seg>
<seg id="1751">Canadians have always carried small maple leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors.</seg>

<seg id="1753">With us there are no weapons!</seg>
<seg id="1754">Same-sex marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005!</seg>
<seg id="1755">All seem to think, Canada is so great.</seg>
<seg id="1756">We are polite.</seg>
<seg id="1757">We obviously say very often "apologies."</seg>
<seg id="1758">Canada is allegedly also considered to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not like these types south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>

<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">"" "but there are also some problems with the stamp" "" "nice" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1768">First, to be called "nice" means basically to be diligent - like the good-natured, gentle, yet strangely insignificant figure of Ned Flanders from "The Simpsons" (who has its own Canadian DoppelgÃ¤nger).</seg>
<seg id="1769">If Canada was really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, it would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that "nice" has no personality.</seg>
<seg id="1770">There are no corners and edges, nothing at which you can push.</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to draw no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">This can be something good if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, far away from the things that happen around you.</seg>
<seg id="1773">I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major part of Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to concern ourselves only with our own affairs.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps simply cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence with the neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="1777">We lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends.</seg>
<seg id="1778">Luckily for us (and for the rest of the world) Justin Trudeau entered the stage to show Canadians are more than just "nice." our prime minister has made Canada downright sexy.</seg>

<seg id="1780">A pop band celebrated in Thailand has published a music video that parodies the Junta, which in 2014 seized power and despite its promise to restore the civilian government, the country continues to reign.</seg>
<seg id="1781">The new song "Dictator Girl" (Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells about what regulations he makes his girlfriend.</seg>
<seg id="1782">Although not politically politically, the music video refers indirectly to the continuing military rule of the Junta.</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the country's situation.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The video to the song was a huge success.</seg>
<seg id="1785">Within the first three days alone, the video uploaded on Facebook was 1.254 times and received 8,800 Likes.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Last month, even the Charlie Chaplin Video "The Dictator" in Thailand was even blocked after a group of activists told the public to watch this video.</seg>
<seg id="1787">The video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, particularly as regards the situation of the country under the Junta rule.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Take a look at these recordings of the video, which refer to some of the political issues that Thailand has pursued in the past three years.</seg>
<seg id="1789">"" "the" "" "44 rules of the girls" "" "may refer to the draconian section 44 of the provisional Constitution, which gives an absolute decision about important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army." ""</seg>
<seg id="1790">"" "the 11th rule:" "" "change your attitude" "" "refers to the notorious programme of" "" "change in settings" "" "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other persons viewed by the Junta as critics." ""</seg>
<seg id="1791">The picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state.</seg>
<seg id="1792">For this purpose, a new unit was established in the army, monitoring online content and prosecuting people accused of having slandered the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand establishes a strict law against "Lese Majeste" (Majestic Post).</seg>
<seg id="1794">On 20 May 2014, martial law was proclaimed in Thailand.</seg>
<seg id="1795">Two days later it came to a coup of the army.</seg>
<seg id="1796">One of the problems the Junta continues to pursue is their decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money.</seg>
<seg id="1797">In the video, it is even shown how people are thrown into a black vans before bringing them into an internment camp, another problem.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Some journalists sit in prison because they allegedly caused "confusion" in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences, they should offense the monarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1799">Meanwhile the teaser of the songs showed members of the band, who imitated the Salut from "The tribute of Panem," which was already used by Putin's opponents during the protests in 2014.</seg>

<seg id="1807">Villages like Dzhantukha, Akarmara, Pyataya Shakhta, Polyana and Kharchava are located in the coal basins of Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1808">Various ethnic groups such as Russians, Greeks, depreciation, Georgians and Armenians lived and worked together on soviet sites in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1809">Many of them had to leave their homes during the war.</seg>
<seg id="1810">Today, most of the Russians and rabbits live in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1811">Such settlements are also called ghost towns in Abkhazia.</seg>
<seg id="1812">During the pre-war period, more than 10,000 people still lived here, today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns.</seg>
<seg id="1813">This phenomenon is characteristic of Tkuarchal.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Since 2011, the total population of the district amounted to 16,000 people after having barely risen over a decade.</seg>
<seg id="1815">In 1989 about 43.000 people lived in this district.</seg>

<seg id="1898">On the way of migrants who cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality.</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">It is led by a 59- year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink spectacle frame and gold coloured earring in teddy bear shape.</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">For about $2.50 the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal.</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants come here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">Sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells, people come to full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start to cry: "mum Africa!</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">At the moment it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has received 200 guests at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1911">There are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside.</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anybody.</seg>
<seg id="1913">She also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them medicines that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey.</seg>
<seg id="1914">Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived shortly.</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was a proper nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">They have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to take a first stop in South America and then move towards the north.</seg>
<seg id="1925">"" "the family had heard of other companions of Mama Africa." "" "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "" "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already talk about Whatsapp from Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Like many of his companions, Michelet has previously lived in Brazil and worked as a builder on building sites of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cup.</seg>
<seg id="1928">When the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest of Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money in order to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs RamÃ­rez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her to go again," he responds smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. RamÃ­rez tells her guests often send text messages when they are gone to greet them or to report about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">She doesn't know much about Africa but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like in Ghana.</seg>
<seg id="1935">Ms. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants traveling through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city, a dead end leads to JesÃºs Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">This winter Valenzuela and his family have taken immigrants in their small house.</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">He has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar that night.</seg>
<seg id="1940">At the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Some sleep on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside.</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience.</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border across the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason I give them my support. "</seg>
<seg id="1946">After having lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job.</seg>
<seg id="1947">The majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them.</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children, who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">In Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown person, a single-mother, offered him her roof.</seg>
<seg id="1950">A few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next step is to go.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses, the travelers consult their telephones quietly.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Ms. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full but she is also nostalgic, because of those who have gone away.</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">There is one of her daughter with African hair weaving she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old.</seg>

<seg id="1960">A check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users</seg>
<seg id="1961">The inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in the west of China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1962">On July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi were given a mobile notification in which she assigns the district government to install a monitoring app named Jingwang (or "web cleaning").</seg>
<seg id="1963">"" "in the announcement, it is said that the app" "" "prevent access to terrorist information" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">However, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="1965">According to an exclusive report of Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they installed the app, exchanged messages with a private chat group.</seg>
<seg id="1966">The police report states that the app would investigate and track the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists, along with "illegal religious" activities and "harmful information" including videos, images, eBooks and documents.</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">Jingwang is a security service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom.</seg>
<seg id="1969">The main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and to remotely control their own home network.</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app, featuring filters for minors, aims to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many different ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"" "for example, the" "" "remote control" "" "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal the home network of a person." ""</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to monitor digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">While reports about digital censorship in China focus mostly on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in distant, afflicted ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet.</seg>
<seg id="1975">To limit unrest and discontent in conflict areas, authorities often associate extreme censors and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns.</seg>
<seg id="1976">The media outlets, which are based on Twitter, published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents randomly as to whether they had installed the monitoring app.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">If you are spotted at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be detained up to 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced the people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment with the rest of the rest.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"" "" "" "images from mainland China" "" "also published a Jingwang product description which indicates that the software can lift the password request of a Windows operating system and thus gain unlimited access to the computer's hard drive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1985">After the installation of Jingwang, computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the City Council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">All government branches, authorities and institutions connected with the party including universities and research institutions are obliged to follow the instructions provided by the Cybersecurity Office on the operation of their computers and communication devices.</seg>
<seg id="1988">A current Freedom House report, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:</seg>
<seg id="1989">In Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi in order to register their "personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards" at local police by August 1.</seg>
<seg id="1990">The intention is obviously to identify and destroy any "terrorist" videos. however, this action violates the rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offences, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages.</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">Some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I didn't do anything to earn this penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Of punishment in all its diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>

<seg id="2090">The Jordanian Rapper Emallam Hdaib talks about the rights of LGBTQ + community, freedom of expression and opposition</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text.</seg>
<seg id="2093">Emallam Hdaib spends most of his time inside; sometimes he shuffles to his screen, sometimes to his computer, back and again to his couch.</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips filed with nicotine.</seg>
<seg id="2095">He lives in the topmost floor of his family house, which belonged to them since 1967; the year in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as rocky (about: Farmer).</seg>
<seg id="2096">For six years now, Hdaib is a passionate activist who faced the conservative majority and questioned its old-established opinions on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapscore.</seg>
<seg id="2097">With his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, Racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman, but also in cities ranging from Damascus to Syria and to Sanaa in Yemen.</seg>
<seg id="2098">With his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can feel the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya.</seg>
<seg id="2099">Even if he doesn't openly admit it, he has a special aversion against the US foreign policy.</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as "Palestinian refugees from the second generation" - so he describes himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib.</seg>
<seg id="2104">"" "then he adds:" "" "I think that because I am a man," "" "while he pours in water, NescafÃ© shakes in two cups. it is the Holy month Ramadan; in this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset." ""</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">Obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically, the flax of lukewarm coffee and the rakes of the Kent-cigarette in the nose are primarily of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">Sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you have a look at neighboring countries.</seg>
<seg id="2109">Therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water to drink - in order not to land in prison.</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Ministry of Jordan has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">Some MPs who support the Islamic action front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the country's cultural and traditional norms and is the main reason for the concert.</seg>
<seg id="2112">"" "the deputies and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "" "was cancelled" "" "because of the singer's sexual orientation." ""</seg>
<seg id="2113">Many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism which inquired the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region.</seg>
<seg id="2114">In a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila underestimated the Jordanian people as "progressive supporters of human rights" who continue to use "intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">This statement probably should not be simply shallow rhetoric but in fact an increasingly clear crystallizing reality reflected in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work.</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016, Hdaib regained traditional gender norms by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the canvas.</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should really trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">Over the past few years, the number of 'honour murders' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">According to Human Rights Watch, the number of honorary morals reached its peak in 2016; however, there is still more aggravating that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women who were victims of murders or domestic violence in an appropriate way.</seg>
<seg id="2121">According to a law on firefighting from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can "indefinitely be held in prison," and for their release it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic expenditure as well as the guarantee on the part of the family that the woman won't happen.</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music is also very popular and is well-known not to shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression.</seg>
<seg id="2124">"" "" "" "I come from the Middle East, man." ""</seg>
<seg id="2125">"" "politics has been solicited to me," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed," Hdaib tackles the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"" "in" "" "Lawla al 3aib" "" "and in" "" "Ghareeb" "" "the focus is on poverty." ""</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song, a verse often repeats itself:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"" "" "" "you are free, and everyone else is." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2132">In the course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can, in his words, "get what you want" - be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality.</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals have been censored in 2014 even until 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to note later that his comments from the context were torn, twisted and censored in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2135">"" "" "" "on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but only a revised version," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="2136">Today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals does not correspond to Islam.</seg>
<seg id="2137">He mentions Abu Nuevo, a poet of the eighth century, which is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems.</seg>
<seg id="2138">Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuevo, who later was to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?</seg>
<seg id="2139">The real problem, like Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled.</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite realm, there is nothing new anymore that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">More recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service held several former government officials and members of the teacher association, with the reason that they had critically expressed concern on the issues related to corruption in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2142">In view of this, the concert Hdaibs is said to be just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians.</seg>
<seg id="2143">For him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denounced Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is what Hdaib sees - consists of slow, deliberate and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society.</seg>
<seg id="2144">In the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without any intervention from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="2145">He does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to "experience it."</seg>
<seg id="2146">Perhaps the region is approached by music, art and literature of genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streaming unitions and artificially directed democracies. at least he hopes that.</seg>
<seg id="2147">Until it is ready, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist.</seg>

<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">These big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">It is assumed that there is a variant of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, drums and dancing came over more than a thousand years and came from a time when armies of West Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi to the knees.</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">We could snap up a few great seats, so we have a great view.</seg>
<seg id="2155">It is difficult to imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">A community center in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally.</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro Gajoen for a long time: two fixed cars are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">Nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only truth - and still a breathtaking way to spend their summer:</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>
<seg id="2160">Yattemare! "# summer festival in the north of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>

<seg id="2167">Rarely, external appearance and body care were as important as in this story, as they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser.</seg>
<seg id="2168">El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima's capital, a region with a very high crime rate where street-consuming and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace.</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region do not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">At the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - experiences an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men.</seg>
<seg id="2171">The trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hairdressers who can reproduce these elaborate hairstyles.</seg>
<seg id="2172">The unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the outermost limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers "Batalla de Barberos," which has been taking place since 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2173">There, experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (more videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">Educational institutions such as the Augusto Salazar Bondy School, located in El Callao, have an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressers and to receive training in hairdressing, which allows them to find work.</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school presented special training workshops prior to the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">In 1995 we were the only vocational school in the municipality and the district we are very proud of, because we have built up this educational community for love for the children.</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: love letters to guerilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>

<seg id="2181">"" "the following article is the revised version of the contribution" "" "Love messages to guerilla fighters" "" "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve." ""</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">Isn't it much more important, people who feel expelled, affection?</seg>
<seg id="2185">This was precisely the question of the young Colombian activists Leonardo PÃ¡rraga from the Bogota Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation and inspired her to the Carta por la ReconciliaciÃ³n (Letters to Reconciliation) campaign, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">Only recently their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their part: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace agreement with the FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the end of the longest armed conflict in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="2187">The signing of the peace treaty was so significant that Colombian President JosÃ© Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits.</seg>
<seg id="2188">However, in front of the Colombian people there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace.</seg>
<seg id="2189">Guerrilla fighters who lived in illegal camps for many years, who had been subjected to war rhetoric and carrying weapons around the clock, must now re-integrate themselves into life as civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2190">The Colombian society, in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerilla fighters, must now take these into their ranks and support them in the construction of a new life.</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians could join together and help the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerilla fighter, which is to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">The idea for reconciliation was born at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2196">This one explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need them much more.</seg>
<seg id="2197">He plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent need.</seg>
<seg id="2198">Thus the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who will now find their place in society and build a new life. "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of war history a common history of peace," they say.</seg>
<seg id="2199">More than 2,000 letters have been collected during the campaign so far.</seg>
<seg id="2200">The initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡.</seg>
<seg id="2201">'i never thought someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over on 19 March in one of the UN camps in the region of Caldono Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">A group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogota Foundation go to the camp to personally transfer the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC focused on how they had done it earlier in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">But this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country.</seg>
<seg id="2206">It was a very moving moment for everyone involved. "it is unbelievable how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between," told the political scientist Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later.</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience:</seg>
<seg id="2208">After passing the letters, a former warrior took me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2209">When I looked into one of the "Cambuches" (a kind of hut in which the guerilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something.</seg>
<seg id="2210">I was afraid to go in, because next to him lying on the bed was a MGL pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"" "I told him anyway and asked," "" "Hello, what are they doing?" "" "he said," "" "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me." ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">Never before in my life someone wrote something like a nice thing, so I answer it. "suddenly, the tears ran over the cheeks.</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him all firmly and sat next to the pomegranate.</seg>
<seg id="2215">Perhaps he was sorry for the war too, was sorry to be the faithful companion of this fighter for all the years, and wanted to help him write this letter.</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. joining the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers from starvation. "I would never have thought anyone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society outside, waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I only learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"" "but now where peace rules, I can learn many things and work in dignity." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">As a prelude, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion group.</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already a war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">That is why the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organisation, their ideals, and gave an insight into their views on the peace process: "for many years we have experienced how social injustice done on the part of the state on the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can help shape society more justly in this country.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"" "for a goal of this magnitude, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," "" "one of them said." ""</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">Hearing these people who haven't found a hearing before and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their life circumstances and their environment was very painful for me.</seg>
<seg id="2227">The reality in which the country lives, hurts me.</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforts me that all people - even those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the camp's commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote, for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, the archbishop of Cali, the following letter:</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian people were prophesied that after the disarmament there would be peace.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">As long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, raise themselves and protest for their rights. and that is also fully justified (...).</seg>
<seg id="2234">"" "" "" "we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons." ""</seg>
<seg id="2235">That is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war.</seg>
<seg id="2236">We give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties.</seg>
<seg id="2237">On our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them.</seg>

<seg id="2247">Several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines after reports have been published that deal with worsening, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities suspected of suspicious queer men and hiding them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>

<seg id="2260">After that, the photos of my documents through the whole WhatsApp made the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On October 10, 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"" "when I was about to fetch a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," "" "Here is a gift for you from your uncle." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">When I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I hurt nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"" "then I heard a sentence, but this time on Chechnya:" "" "how long do you want to dishonor the family, you scandal?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old.</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital at the end of the night.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything to get along and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man was fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called a ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">In the hospital I learned that I had two broken wounds in my right lung.</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wings were you placed - in which men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">Sabrina: my documents are obsolete, there's still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women.</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very grateful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">When I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it afraid to do; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name.</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has dealt with me respectfully.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February, I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">They called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown.</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">They asked me to return to Chechnya to prove that this was all a lie.</seg>
<seg id="2284">They made absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by running up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my gender, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop.</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have granny size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for her.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"" "they said to her," "" "You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family but the entire republic." ""</seg>
<seg id="2290">We cannot touch you because you are a pious woman but you have to disappear from here. "</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother was too much and she laid a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened window panes and a numberplate with a 95 on it.</seg>
<seg id="2295">After it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was a bit lazy.</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">For security reasons I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me.</seg>
<seg id="2300">With her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened.</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Just before leaving Moscow, I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">I bought it without registering me, without identification without everything.</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I plug the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">At the moment when I wanted to invoke my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message: "you don't think you'd be safe, just because you left the country?</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you hide. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">However, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo subject.</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">As much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier.</seg>
<seg id="2318">I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her.</seg>
<seg id="2319">When we chat with camera, I am actually trying to look like the person she recalls from her past - so to my male form.</seg>
<seg id="2320">But this is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do, those who have stayed there?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who sat in gun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">He said that during Ramadan, there were no people arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not shut up a new wave.</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">With this I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end require a proof that the so-called "honor" has experienced by blood satisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men now still captured in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there would not be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">If, then, above all those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to present themselves to Kadyrow's judgment.</seg>
<seg id="2332">As far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="2333">"" "say:" "" "if they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base." ""</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">As if these people were not simply disappeared, but deliberately submerged in order to radicalise.</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this just a guess or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone imprisoned in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard had grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">And this so-called Lord, that person himself was there when these people were taken along.</seg>
<seg id="2342">Up to now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports so far. we suspect that such actions are quite possible.</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know whether these persecutions and abductions of people belonging to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya, I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite big Grozny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">Even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2350">On the contrary, it was much safer than now.</seg>
<seg id="2351">"" "Russia wanted to bring us to" "" "Civilizations" "", "but eventually pushed us back into the Stone Age." ""</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed lashes, wore tubular jeans and short loops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Health of Sharia has never crooked me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially at weekends, met a whole group of people like me.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there.</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is, "Don't talk about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you because they believed you were ill?</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never insulted me, never chased me and never beaten me.</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace begin?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrov came to the plan for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2365">When he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television.</seg>
<seg id="2366">He did not talk about us per se, but primarily on women's behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2367">Nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">But every time I came back home I could feel how the situation in the Republic was constantly worsening.</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I'm still active as an activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">We organize teacreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards.</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't make a cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I clapped out refuges.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's albern.</seg>
<seg id="2383">So nature is, it has nothing to do with religion.</seg>
<seg id="2384">This is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to prophesy with foam in front of the mouth that there are no gay men.</seg>
<seg id="2385">"" "the Dagestans have which, the cabardines have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet they exist - but" "" "not in Chechnya." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">I'm from there, so it's unpleasant to hear something like that.</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">Do you know many think about the transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his gender to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy.</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different ways of feeling to be exact, different attitudes of life.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me, it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personally here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">Since the last few months there is a strong rise in suicide.</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">The self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, characterised by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight.</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the Ahwaz region in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">He suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness to be able to stand up for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who want to work in Ahwaz and wish to remain anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube held the moments after he had kindled himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">Some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the town of Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors could not do anything any more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">It was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arab Ahwazi minority, and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take their lives.</seg>
<seg id="2408">The Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - have suffered.</seg>
<seg id="2409">Their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Arab Ahwazi suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination</seg>
<seg id="2411">The region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi community living in Iran has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it difficult for the native Arab population to deny its livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2412">A century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy took over power and took great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2413">In the Ahwaz region there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2414">Despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop only slowly, and the local population only gets little from this wealth.</seg>
<seg id="2415">It is often victims of untreated diseases, hunger and privation.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Iranian regime systematically refuses to produce jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The government has also built a variety of dams that diverge water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located.</seg>
<seg id="2418">These dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industries.</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawk youngsters increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director of Cooperative, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job, completed primary school, completed 55% secondary school and 45% have a university degree.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"" "a" "" "systematic strategy... aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2422">Karim Dohimi, an Iranian Ahwazi human rights activist with resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of "poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination" leads to a "high rise" in the number of suicide among young Ahwazi-men.</seg>
<seg id="2423">"" "" "" "this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process." ""</seg>
<seg id="2424">As officials and institutions do not prefer to hire Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to work opportunities in all sectors.</seg>
<seg id="2425">This is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and compel them to earn their living outside their homeland Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2426">There are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arab names are not tolerated at the workplace, let alone speak the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothes.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Given the circumstances surrounding the Arab Ahwazi, human rights activists suggest an alarm before the situation is explosive.</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and aware of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement published by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">When I say that I am not a feminist, many women react - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - with frustration.</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought-out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">For example, despite equal education women still earn less money than men nowadays.</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">Or that cultural and social norms will still cause women to stumble sooner or later in various spheres of life on a glass ceiling, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs.</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I suffer twice and triple below.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">And yet: if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to silence feminists.</seg>
<seg id="2448">However, they all agree that women - all women - should come together in order to "lift up their voices and 'Kumbaya, my Lord', in order to achieve equal rights (some) of women.</seg>
<seg id="2449">But they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalized form of racially motivated violence that we are exposed to black women in two ways.</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women from other ethnicities and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">That black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls, due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"" "" "" "or that women in black spheres and women with migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2453">On the one hand, I want all women to have equal rights for all men and all men. on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement whose centre is the white woman who refuses to take into account injustices in their thinking, which refer both to gender and skin colour of a person.</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist-oriented sphere that has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women.</seg>
<seg id="2455">In 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech: "am I not a woman?" and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in an historical sense a mentionless and marginalized being.</seg>
<seg id="2456">I refuse to join groupings, which in addition absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation to advance their egocentric program.</seg>
<seg id="2457">I will no longer try to close white women the importance of overlapping skin color and gender. some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them for the better.</seg>
<seg id="2458">Although the intersectional feminism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and to distinguish themselves from white feminism, the word "feminism" is still in its name.</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to release myself fully and completely from feminism and join the Movement of Womanism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, rather than advocating myself for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: reclaiming, says that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped, which make up the black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2462">Although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected.</seg>
<seg id="2463">In a womanistic environment I can lift black women and women from other cultures, because I exist in this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment in which my life is neither bypassed nor ignored, nor rejected.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article is part of the series # PorserMujer (# weighteinefraubin), which reports about the wave of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">A police inspector said Ada BÃ¡ez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent towards her.</seg>
<seg id="2483">Since the end of their relationship some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put into the files, but more could not be done.</seg>
<seg id="2484">When another woman showed Balbuena because of abuse, the well-known display of Ada BÃ¡ez also took advantage of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later, the second wife retired.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">In general, if women make an ad at all, they generally do not receive any support from the state.</seg>
<seg id="2488">In many cases, the women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit being victims of violence must notify the prosecution authorities at all.</seg>

"there are various indications and reports, which, however, do not even point out the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">However, the figures available are alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">In 2015, 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence at the District Attorney Office. 70% of these were violence against women.</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace. here too 86% of the ads of women came.</seg>
<seg id="2495">In the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2496">These statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">According to the Paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually displayed. "there are 9 women who do not do so in Paraguay because of psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2498">"" "on every woman who is subject to physical abuse, two women who do not do so," "" "she declared at the end of 2014." ""</seg>
<seg id="2499">Since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an own criminal act, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2500">Until August 2016 alone, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of suicide in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">According to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies because of violent acts by men.</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible abuse and a legal system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">Before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends.</seg>
<seg id="2506">At the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she did. this should always be regrettable.</seg>
<seg id="2507">Today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos. but for two years she endured psychological violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult recognizable:</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">When I read about it before, I always thought that only women who are too subservient because they are deceived by violent men.</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report abuses by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">Without naming a name, she wrote articles on Facebook where she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he rhetorically asked if he had ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why she had enjoyed Carlos and didn't leave him in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some kind of complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Victoria Santos, who was not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that their former partner abused them.</seg>
<seg id="2517">"" "Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo (" "" "I believe you" "" ") composed of women who are all victims of abuse in some way." ""</seg>
<seg id="2518">In the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">Victorias ads with the authorities remained without result and even from their relatives, she received no support.</seg>
<seg id="2524">She led a trial against her former partner who developed into an unmanageable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner.</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach, poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"" "" "" "in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied." ""</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "the ad of abuse is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice," "" "says Victoria Santos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2528">Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2529">On 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# for you).</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# Non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees to explain Femizid to an independent criminal act and to punish the hardest as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Thus the text was changed in a number of points in order to also win the deputies for the law, fearing that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is generally forbidden, which is in principle forbidden in Paraguay and will be punished with up to five years imprisonment.</seg>
<seg id="2533">The original bill had envisaged most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs which the victims of violence have to carry on themselves, if they simply furnish indication and want a secure accommodation to impose the state.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay abuse is seen as part of interpersonal relationships.</seg>
<seg id="2536">Here a rethinking must take place, so violence is no longer regarded as a normal thing.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Whoever is silent in the face of these facts makes himself guilty and contributes to the fact that the offenders get away.</seg>
<seg id="2538">"" "" "" "we have to refund as long as mistreatment is no longer considered normal." ""</seg>
<seg id="2539">On 10 November 2016, the law was passed in the Paraguayan Senate. however, parts of the law had been changed, including a passage taken by the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="2540">Opinions on the changes go apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>

<seg id="2545">Independent media in Oman suspended one year after banning a newspaper</seg>
<seg id="2546">"" "" "" "this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information" "" "on the homepage of the banned newspaper Azamn." ""</seg>
<seg id="2547">More than a year ago, the Iranian authorities closed the independent Arab-language newspaper Azamn for their reporting on corruption in the sultan.</seg>
<seg id="2548">Yousef Al-Haj, one of the editors of the newspaper, remains in prison, where he served a one-year prison sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2549">Two other editors of Azamn, Ibrahim Al-Maamari and zaher Al-Abri, were arrested and put in trial, but later released.</seg>
<seg id="2550">Oman has been ruled by Sultan Qabus ibn Said since 1970, who came to power after he had put his father, Said ibn Taimur, through a coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="2551">Since then, in addition to his role as the only Sultan, he has held the most important positions in the country: Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, Finance Minister, Foreign Minister, Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank.</seg>
<seg id="2552">The Sultan's rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces, in particular domestic secret services, civil liberties, including press freedom, restricting and detecting human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists.</seg>
<seg id="2553">The authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens, including activists, to express their views on the country's public affairs, such as corruption in public authorities and institutions, both online and offline.</seg>
<seg id="2554">The attack on the newspaper Azamn, its closure and imprisonment three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country.</seg>
<seg id="2555">Azamn is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman (an absolute monarchy) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2556">On July 28, 2016, security forces Ibrahim Al-Maamari, editor-in-chief of Azamn, found an article published in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 with the title "High-ranking parties bind the hands of the judiciary." this was about corruption in the judiciary and the interference of high-ranking officials in judicial decisions.</seg>
<seg id="2557">In the report government officials were accused of having pressurised judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to raise a verdict in a inheritance.</seg>

<seg id="2559">Photo source: Facebook page of Azamn</seg>
<seg id="2560">On 3 August 2016, he was charged Al-Abri, a member of the editorial committee, from ISS before the special department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2561">On 9 August 2016, the ISS received the deputy editor-in-chief Yousef Al-Haj, who had acted as chief editor after Al-Maamaris's arrest.</seg>
<seg id="2562">The newspaper was closed indefinitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that "publishing and spreading the paper on any way, including online, is banned from 9 August 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2563">On 26 September 2016, the first trial in the trial against Al-Maamari, Al-Haj and Al-Abri took place before the Court in Masat.</seg>
<seg id="2564">The Court sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and ordered the final closure of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2565">"" "al-Maamari and Al-Haj were both convicted of disruption of public order," "" "abuse of the Internet" "" "and" "" "undermining the prestige of the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2566">In addition, al-Haj was found guilty of breach of a ban on publication and defamation.</seg>
<seg id="2567">Al-Maamari and Al-Haj were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fines of $3,000 each ($7800). furthermore, a year-long career prohibition against the two journalists was imposed.</seg>
<seg id="2568">Al-Abri was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Rial (2600 US dollars) after he was found guilty of using "an information network to disseminate material that could pose a threat to public order."</seg>
<seg id="2569">For al-Abri, a damage deposit of 5,000 omani Rial was established (13,000 US dollars) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016.</seg>
<seg id="2570">The Appeals Court acquitted Al-Abri in a hearing on 26 December 2016 and sentenced Al-Haj to six months in prison for one year and Al-Maamari.</seg>
<seg id="2571">Al-Maamari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six months sentence from the central prison in Masat. al-Haj is still in prison, where he served his imprisonment sentence.</seg>
<seg id="2572">The Appeals Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the "Azamn" newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2573">In spite of the decision of the Court to relinquish Azamn, the paper is still facing attacks by the Iranian government.</seg>
<seg id="2574">On 8 January, the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of "Azamn" was extended three months.</seg>
<seg id="2575">On 8 May 2017, the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement, in which the closure of "Azamn" was extended by three additional months, and with which the minister presented himself once again against the decision of the Appeals Court to restore the publication of the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2576">The ongoing closure of Azamn and the attacks against journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which Oman has recently violated the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2577">Further injuries include, for example, the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mowatine and the exercise of pressure on Albalad, the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation.</seg>
<seg id="2578">Due to the ongoing closure of Azamn and the detention of the journalist Al-Haj, the impression arises that the Iranian authorities are still unwilling to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press.</seg>
<seg id="2579">The Gulf Centre for Human Rights (Gulf Centre for Human Rights, GCHR) calls on the Iranian authorities:</seg>
<seg id="2580">1. release Yousef Al-Haj promptly and unconditionally;</seg>
<seg id="2581">2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Azamn so that their journalists can follow their work;</seg>
<seg id="2582">3. to protect the press freedom in the country and</seg>
<seg id="2583">4. to ensure that human rights defenders and journalists in Oman unhindered their legitimate human rights work without fear of retaliation measures, including judicial harassment.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The Gulf Center for Human Rights (GCHR) is an independent, non-governmental and non-governmental organization that supports human rights defenders (including independent journalists, bloggers, lawyers, etc.) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring states by promoting the freedom of expression and association and the right to assemble, support and protect them.</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, mapping takes place with his agreement</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on-site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">Diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investments for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem.</seg>
<seg id="2591">Secondly, research conducted by African scientists is helping establish its own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2592">Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ).</seg>
<seg id="2593">He grew up in Lusaka, Zambia in the 1990s, just as the AIDS epidemic showed a serious impact on national health.</seg>
<seg id="2594">He left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana.</seg>
<seg id="2595">As a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself researched the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the SÃ¡b health system.</seg>
<seg id="2596">With Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research.</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrier talks as a private person).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the Sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">In addition, I just started a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens.</seg>
<seg id="2601">GV: what do you think is the most important scientific topics in your country and in general in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there is no basic research here. we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">This has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being makers.</seg>
<seg id="2605">The solutions we get are often not well applicable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here.</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are funded differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here, because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GM: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research work you did not previously have?</seg>
<seg id="2614">RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet.</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory material is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GM: how is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it concentrate on, and how can we support the development?</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">There is a need for special academic training, starting at any age.</seg>
<seg id="2623">Social sciences, computer science, big data, research of space, healthcare (non-transferable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly.</seg>
<seg id="2624">GM: can you describe the pros and cons of life as scientists in Africa over Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here.</seg>
<seg id="2626">"" "the system that magazines can only make articles against payment (the so-called" "" "Paywall" "" ") also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research." ""</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">This contribution from Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website of Ensia.com, a magazine that reports on solutions for environmental problems worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has bred a salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Its company offers 114 varieties, such as OutredGorgeous, the first plant that has been grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space.</seg>
<seg id="2631">For almost 20 years, Morton's work has been limited only by its own resourcefulness and the question of how many species of salads he can get.</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">The patents lay not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curly leaves.</seg>
<seg id="2634">In recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants like cereal or carton varieties. based on these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts in food security are concerned about the future of food production.</seg>
<seg id="2635">As a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still cultivating salad, but meanwhile he needs longer because his work is increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"" "" "" "it is as if there is a boulder in a river that I have to mate." ""</seg>
<seg id="2637">"" "so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," "" "he says." "" "I think that these patents go far too far." ""</seg>
<seg id="2638">And if they stand in court, nobody can breed any new species of lettuce, because all characteristics have already been patented. "he continues to do as good as possible and tries to extract the characteristics he wants.</seg>
<seg id="2639">However, it is very careful and endeavours not to use any material that is protected as intellectual property.</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and around the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts at the International Space Station ISS have bred and ate red RÃ¶mersalat of the Outredst variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds like the movement from the IT field and not from the area of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for open-source seeds) is inspired by the movement for free "open source" software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was established in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can thus be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">As part of the initiative, called Ossi (Ossi), US breeders may commit that others can use the seeds bred by them freely.</seg>
<seg id="2647">This does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell them. "open source" breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately cut it off - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents.</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">For the emeriated professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control of the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important both for food security and environmental protection.</seg>
<seg id="2651">As a result, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seeds with natural resistance.</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement does not deal with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">All kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not. "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control of the seed, whose recent examples are the amalgamations of ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer." those who want to buy good, locally and sustainably produced vegetables should also know that the way this vegetables are grown is threatened.</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food sovereignty without seed sovereignty is not possible." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">The members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to continuing to make their seed available to others. in contrast, their approach is to patent seeds and plant characteristics.</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is endangered, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the growing intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore increasingly available.</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all the carton features are protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders at all or only difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2659">For other plants, such estimates do not yet exist, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than salad or carrots.</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">Plants are bred in such a way that they have purposefully desired characteristics - from those through which their taste or colour improves up to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and resist threats such as pests or diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, as the changed conditions are much worse than ever due to climate change.</seg>
<seg id="2663">In an e-mail, Monsanto spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Ministry of Agriculture set up the company for the conservation of genetic diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2664">"" "however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property includes other breeders, since" "" "patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "" "a patent is basically a plan everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired." ""</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method to the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">So, such protection does not block innovations, but encourages them by making more material and know-how available to the public. "</seg>
<seg id="2667">Morton sees this differently: waiting for 20 years until a patent expired, certainly does not promote innovation.</seg>
<seg id="2668">And if one has to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have already lost the struggle.</seg>
<seg id="2669">However, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources should always have been a common good and should remain: "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us.</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"" "this is what drives us and it is impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2672">"" "in general, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant characteristics:" "" "we do not really create the features ourselves." ""</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form them themselves and as a breeder, we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">For Carol Deppe, plant breeders in the US state Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding: "those who breed a variety breed their own values into them.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, are needed for their cultivation in mass-wise herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"" "my concept is exactly opposite." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">While some medium-sized enterprises (those who move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto), they manage most smaller seed companies to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not worthwhile or both are the case.</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">Morton also believes that breeders are more innovative by avoiding plant patents: "it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent.</seg>
<seg id="2682">I always need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a few years, "he says." with a patent you are protected from competition for 20 years, making it easy in my opinion. "worldwide response</seg>

<seg id="2684">In India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ("Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, is a "open source" seed program. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre works with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements.</seg>

<seg id="2686">"" "the German organization Agrecol is working on an" "" "open-source" "" "license which is ultimately a more formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">(rules for breeding vary from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">At the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable, thus addressing the current practice of the European Patent Office that allows patents on conventionally bred plants.</seg>
<seg id="2689">However, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the patent office to implement this new line.</seg>
<seg id="2690">In October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on "open source" seed systems in Ethiopia, farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa to learn about the open source seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for open source seed systems, explains that the organization currently builds a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems for which the official start-up should be scheduled next year.</seg>
<seg id="2692">A combination of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map.</seg>

<seg id="2720">Human rights organisations and blog are the latest goals of censorship in Egypt</seg>
<seg id="2721">The Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="2722">This time it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a columnist.</seg>
<seg id="2723">On the weekend of 05.August, the Egyptian government closed the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information (ANHRI), which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported on the above.</seg>
<seg id="2724">In August, the network published an opinion on Facebook, in which the Egyptian authorities criticised for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Arabic Network for Human Rights information remains true, despite this attack and the mockery of Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who should defend the law in order to expose the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world. even though it has never been so difficult to overcome these goals, it was never as important as now.</seg>
<seg id="2726">ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news site Mada Masr, Arabic-language issue of the Huffington Post and the Qatar-based network of Al Jazeera for alleged "support of terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="2727"># Egypt: 1. human rights organisation of the wave of website barriers to victims. @ anhri is one of the main data sources for human rights in Arabic language https: / / t.co / NIZmOpDS5K</seg>
<seg id="2728">In addition to ANHRI, there is no access to the blog of columnist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gamal Ziada.</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes for websites and media not accessible for Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2730">Now the blog, which he set up to circumvent the censored apparatus of the Egyptian government, became the goal of an attack.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Blogger, the provider in which also Canada's blog is given a home, is further accessible.</seg>
<seg id="2732">Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how police exercised physical violence against two students.</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles mainly revolve around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the ban by the government and reflected what this meant for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">The blogs to lock is very old but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even though the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:</seg>
<seg id="2736">1) They have managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege; arrest, attempted murder, discharge at the national Security Council, blocked blogs as well as any other website for which I worked.</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, albeit only to a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First, I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">But now, after blocking it and that they are afraid of words, I still can change the link or create a second blog.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave ones go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">According to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August 133. this resulted in technical tests in the networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat.</seg>
<seg id="2743">In addition, afte also documented the blocking of providers, through which internet censorship and private surfing was possible, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">On Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of web pages which VPNs offer began.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content that might have access to the Egyptian users.</seg>
<seg id="2747">The situation is also worsened by the fact that the decisions of the censorship are taken behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis through which it can proceed in court against these actions.</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack it next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>
<seg id="2751">The Brazilian army at the Favelas in NiterÃ³i, a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro, during the government crisis.</seg>
<seg id="2752">Photo of: Estado Maior (CML) via photos pÃºblica, CC-BY-NC 2.0</seg>
<seg id="2753">Day after day newspapers in the whole of Brazil report with gloomy headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motifs.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves Robben Pharmacy with Military Weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and airwaves to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"" "" "" "in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the force wave 2017 in Rio achieved the highest level for 10 years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; find at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"" "the newspaper" "" "Extra" "", "known for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio, published the editorial" "" "This is not normal" "", "in which she announced a new section called" "" "War in Rio" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">Extra will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex crime, etc. everything that happens from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section "War in Rio." (...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In a four-minute video shared on Facebook, OctÃ¡vio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper stated that this decision was no reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">In the same video, a journalist explained that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial, the newspaper writes:</seg>
<seg id="2768">We are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions.</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">In an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist CecÃ­lia Oliveira argues against calling the violence as a "war." this is in their opinion a justification for the failed security policy through the media and could make it more difficult for the police to account.</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"" "" "" "this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as shown extra in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of public service." ""</seg>
<seg id="2774">Reminder: the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital.</seg>

<seg id="2777">"" "according to the statistics of 2015, Rio de Janeiro as" "" "the most violent place in Brazil" "" "is wrong:" "" "22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country. these are the most recent available data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"" "when we look at the killings per state, Rio is in place 16," "" "she writes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2780">Extra belongs to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as in CecÃ­lia emphasises, has been repeating the state's security policy for years.</seg>
<seg id="2781">These safety policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de PolÃ­cia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the State of Rio in 2003, whose goal is to capture a Favela by using a massive police custody and permanently stationed there.</seg>
<seg id="2782">In the beginning, this actually led to a decline in violent deaths. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports of chicanes and repression against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit.</seg>
<seg id="2783">On his Facebook page, journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria for the term "civil war."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">In addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for people.</seg>
<seg id="2786">This requires the state to use means and ways typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a "enemy," where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of "collateral damage" and "lost spheres."</seg>
<seg id="2787">War or her, the fact is that the inhabitants of the Favelas continue to suffer in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="2788">It is now a week that the police cleared the mountain with the Favela Jacopzinho to avenge the death of a policeman.</seg>
<seg id="2789">In the midst of all this violence this incident also made headlines: a salesman died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2802">Since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and blockades, chiefly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops.</seg>
<seg id="2803">According to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PAX and the Research Institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and the surrounding country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib.</seg>
<seg id="2804">The East Ghouta region is particularly badly affected, where an attack on chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians.</seg>
<seg id="2805">Many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition anticipate that the Assad regime's massacre was perpetrated by the United Nations and other human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="2806">Since 2013, these areas, controlled by rebel forces, have been besieged outside Damascus, leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Through the years of blockage, traditional food, such as meat, has become unattainable for large parts of the population.</seg>
<seg id="2808">As a counterpart, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a "life-saving food source."</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghiras Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms are not among the common foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food-worthiness makes them an attractive food source for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">The direct of the project, Abo Nabil, spoke to the French news agency AFP:</seg>
<seg id="2812">"" "" "" "we chose to cultivate mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that has been struggling for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that more and more "gains awareness."</seg>
<seg id="2814">In order to collect money for the initiative, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo is used in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda.</seg>
<seg id="2815">It is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge for planting mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2816">At the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 â¬, but will continue to raise funds to CanDo until Monday, 04 September 2017.</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">Because of the fuel shortages, locally produced fuels are made of plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy.</seg>
<seg id="2819">"" "Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they started with" "" "production from the regions of the mushroom" "" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption." ""</seg>
<seg id="2820">Then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on.</seg>

<seg id="2822">Since the start of the project and after another 3 months, they have distributed fungi everywhere in the East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested in many district capital cities on 21 October in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires raging in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured due to forest fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government spending a week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain, where there were 4 deaths.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is estimated that there were more than 500 fires that spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages.</seg>
<seg id="2837">In June, a similar tragedy occurred in PedrÃ³gÃ£o Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded.</seg>
<seg id="2838">According to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite recording, approximately 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal in 2017 alone - an area of the size of the district Lisbon.</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can get a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire in 4 districts.</seg>

<seg id="2854">The environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of easily combustible wood, spread like in a vicious circle, after fires of this species.</seg>
<seg id="2855">In addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16, when inhabitants sought information or attempted to contact relatives, was offline.</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that supplied the population with information: it used the application of civilians using the application fogos.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of the fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">The project was launched in 2015 by JoÃ£o Pina developer to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the servers were not able to withstand the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the site counted more than half a million hits.</seg>

<seg id="2877">In the morning, the boy was supposed to break up.</seg>
<seg id="2878">His uncle would pick him up and bring him to the tugs.</seg>

<seg id="2884">Abdul Ali Mazari, leader of the party Hezb-e-Wahdat, dominated by Hazara, had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Hazara suddenly felt defenceless.</seg>
<seg id="2885">The Taliban, known for their hatred of Hazara, came closer and closer.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country in the direction of Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">A few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan.</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Then he took what was left of his little wage and went to Iran. once again, he was in a foreign country with other refugees and towed sacks with mortar that were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">At that time, like today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation.</seg>
<seg id="2891">"" "" "" "it was really hard," "" "said Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "" "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we also worked." ""</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night. "</seg>
<seg id="2893">After four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the journey to Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2894">During the dangerous crossing of the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island.</seg>
<seg id="2895">After the Greek authorities rejected asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002.</seg>
<seg id="2896">Some time, Asharaf was homeless, ran through the streets of Rome alone, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to auxiliary persons twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that due to relatively high growth rates, Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers. it is true, however, that the conditions that find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The civil rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"" "the large majority of asylum seekers are housed in more than 3000" "" "special admission centres" "". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2900">According to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to an admission center if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can still be taken for months after the filing of the asylum application.</seg>
<seg id="2901">Until then, people who have no money for accommodation can either rely on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2902">That's how it was Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his unwilling life-willingness helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">After several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his entire savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice.</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast food.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Asharaf Baratis's success story is now the subject of the documentary "Behind Venice Luxury - a Hazara in Italy" (German: "behind venetian luxury - a Hazara in Italy") by the director Amin Wahidi.</seg>
<seg id="2907">The film won the Venice City Award in 2017, which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017.</seg>

<seg id="2911">The conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non-Italians - are very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2912">Much bureaucracy, high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="2913">According to inofficial estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="2914">For many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries.</seg>
<seg id="2915">In recent years, some Afghans have emerged, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">In Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The menu of the restaurant tells the story of their journey to Italy through the various Afghan, Iraqi, Turkish and Greek courts.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Qalandari opened in Padua the Restaurant Peace & amp; Spice and also behind the Pizzeria Kabulogna in Bologna and a sushi restaurant in Rome are also Afghans.</seg>
<seg id="2920">But Asharafs goals reach far beyond the Italian gastronomy trade and retail and aim back to the country which he had forced to leave as a teenager.</seg>
<seg id="2921">"" "" "" "where there is a risk, there are also possibilities," "" "says Asharaf with a smile." "" "I want to invest in Afghanistan." ""</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know that my people are suffering.</seg>
<seg id="2923">I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country, especially for women.</seg>
<seg id="2924">"" "they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2925">Asharaf is also making plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul, where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques. "so they can sell their harvest excess on the market and improve their financial situation," he says.</seg>
<seg id="2926">The development to a successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt, but in the end stability and prosperity stand.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Asharaf has made this journey by himself. now he wants to help other Afghans on this journey.</seg>

<seg id="2929">He reported about the clearing of the camp Raba'a el Adavya in Cairo, which protested against the suspension of President Mohamed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Photo taken by @ Ciluna27 on Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="2931">Global Voices Advocacys Netizen Report is an international snapshot that shows challenges, victories and emerging trends in global internet rights</seg>
<seg id="2932">The Egyptian parliament reviews a draft bill that foresees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government agency.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Users would have to register to use social networks within six months of submitting their full name as well as their ID number within six months following the submission of the law.</seg>
<seg id="2934">Those who neglect this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the final penalty of a penalty.</seg>
<seg id="2935">The law, which was promoted by sixty parliamentarians, is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be debated there.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"" "" "" "in May, another member filed a legislative proposal in which tougher penalties would be introduced to the president or a high official." ""</seg>
<seg id="2937">Under Egyptian law, the decision of the President and state institutions is already punishable. however, under the legislative proposal, such a deed would be punished with prison and fines, as legal experts of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy.</seg>
<seg id="2938">If the law is passed, this can mean up to three years imprisonment for those convicted.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"" "" "" "in addition, this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger already for many years." ""</seg>
<seg id="2940">A striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mahmoud Abo ZID (known as Shawkan) who took photographs on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian police while demonstrating violence against demonstrators who fought against the military coup that led to the removal of the elected President Mohammed Morsi.</seg>
<seg id="2941">Shawkan waited, as more than 700 protest participants, who had been arrested at the same incident four years in prison for a court appointment.</seg>
<seg id="2942">Recently, his trial was postponed to 20 May because the prison leadership failed to bring the accused of prison into the courtroom, according to human rights groups.</seg>
<seg id="2943">Shawkan is threatened with death penalty due to the fact that many human rights groups agree on the apparent burden of fire, illegal gathering, murder and attempted murder.</seg>
<seg id="2944">In another case, a criminal court in Giza released the two journalists Hany Salah-el-Deen and Mosad Al-Barbary. they were indicted for their reporting on pro-Morsi seat blockade on Raba'a Al-Adaviya Square in Cairo.</seg>
<seg id="2945">The Court also reduced the punishment of journalists Abdullah al-Fakharany, Samhi Mustafa and Mohamed al-Adly who were also arrested at the previous incident, from 25 years to 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Tunisian activists to interrogate documents</seg>
<seg id="2947">In May, Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the interrogation of Sami Ben Gharbia, which is co-founder of the independent media platform Nawaat and the Global Voices Advocacy Project.</seg>
<seg id="2948">Ben Gharbia was basically interrogated by the President of the Republic, who, according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial draft law, would guarantee businessmen and during the former regime by dictator Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali the corruption accused officials of amnesty if they return all unlawful funds.</seg>
<seg id="2949">The document published on 21 April on the Nawaat website sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the bill of law look like.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Ben Gharbia rejected the mention of his sources, stating Article 11 of the Tunisian press code, which journalists secure the right to protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="2951">Nevertheless, he joined the District Court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness in the case.</seg>
<seg id="2952">Does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification?</seg>
<seg id="2953">According to new regulations of the Information Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the users of social media in China require a permit before they write or share news in social media.</seg>
<seg id="2954">In the rules it is also stated that the registration with the full real name will be required.</seg>
<seg id="2955">Analysts believe that in this way the elimination of anonymous comments is to be achieved within social networks. it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations.</seg>
<seg id="2956">Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to only selectively enforce these regulations in order to protect citizen journalism and independence.</seg>
<seg id="2957">Then do we see ourselves in "WeChat"?</seg>
<seg id="2958">Not in Russia!</seg>
<seg id="2959">In May, the state censorship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese messaging app WeChat.</seg>
<seg id="2960">According to Roscomnadzor, WeChat agreed to register as the "organiser of the distribution of information."</seg>
<seg id="2961">This term is part of a law dating back to 2014, thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the "publication of the information." the law also allows the government to make said services for the removal of content and to force it on request for the delivery of user data.</seg>
<seg id="2962">These web pages currently include web sites such as Vcontacts and Odnoclasniki (Russia's two most popular social networks), the Image Board 2.ch.hk, email service mail.ru and dozens of other services.</seg>
<seg id="2963">Turkish court has blocked Wikipedias</seg>
<seg id="2964">A Turkish court ordered the release of Wikipedias in Turkey, after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English-language articles, the data that Turkey supports the jihadists in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"" "the Turkish Ministry of Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communication had been blocked because it was" "" "a source of information that cooperates with groups to make a political diffusion campaign against Turkey." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2966">It is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website. it is thus, in addition to China, one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Great Britain can't stop to sniff</seg>
<seg id="2968">After this week, the UK government is in the midst of targeted consultation regarding increased surveillance powers that would force Internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that decrypt data encryption.</seg>
<seg id="2969">The government has consulted telecommunications companies and intelligence services on the proposal, but has left other technology companies and the civilian population on the outside.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Despite all this, the consultation continues until May 19. reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior.</seg>
