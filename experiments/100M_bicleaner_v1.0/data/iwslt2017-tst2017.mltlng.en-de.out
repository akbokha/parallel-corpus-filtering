that is James Ris@@ en .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize in New York Times repor@@ ter .
long before anyone had heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ularly that the N@@ SA had heard illegal phones of Americans .
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation , in which the CIA literally delivered dra@@ fts to Iran for a nuclear bomb .
if that sounds crazy , read it .
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
for almost 10 years the government has been investigating ri@@ fts and called upon him to call his alleged sources .
in this turn he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists .
according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information .
but it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal .
so when the government kno@@ cked at Ris@@ en , he did something that many brave repor@@ ters did before him : he refused and said that he would rather go to jail .
from 2007 to 2015 , ris@@ ons lived with the risk of going into prison .
but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened .
suddenly , although they were assuming for years that it would be essential in their case , the demands of the government were dropped to cracks .
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the repor@@ ters and sources can hide less and less .
instead of failure and ris@@ king to make statements , this could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him .
and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , have been secretly anx@@ ious about his telep@@ hon@@ y .
just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , his credit information , and even travel documents with the list of his flights .
in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and crack .
unfortunately , this is only one of many cases .
President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary condemned him more than all US governments in front of him .
now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret .
since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist .
so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone .
but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to b@@ ypass the rights of repor@@ ters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources .
and they can do that from the moment they get in touch , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the stuff .
today there are communication software that has not yet existed when cra@@ cking had written his book , and it is much safer than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls .
such a technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source translation system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the Internet @-@ renowned Aaron Swar@@ tz , and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work .
instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , like the one here of the Washington Post .
there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any normal contact form .
these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access .
so the government can no longer collect information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset .
Secure@@ Drop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is up to us to ensure that not only technology designers such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to make mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot; &quot; &quot;
who wants to report ab@@ uses in the care of soldiers and wants to report about over@@ crowded hospitals . or the next environmental officer who suggests f@@ lin@@ t to the poll@@ uted water . or a Wall Street In@@ sider who warns us of the next financial crisis .
at least these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights .
thank you .
&#91; on April 3 , 2016 the largest data leak in history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; revealed that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; enormous sums of money &#93; have hidden &#91; enormous sums of money in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works .
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s prime minister resig@@ ned .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ asch@@ ar al @-@ Assad let@@ ter@@ box firms has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
it is said that a track of $ 2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ list .
now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents .
now that sounds like the plot of an agent &apos;s killer or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people .
why should this happen to us ?
but the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services like healthcare , education , roads .
and this concerns us all .
for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenom@@ enal .
media and leading politicians all over the world discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years .
I think many people seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work .
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter .
probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who were present in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal .
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers .
if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US .
in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to give less information to found a company than to get a library card .
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
this allows sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring susp@@ icious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really shock@@ ed that everyone up to a lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . but it shows the problem with this system .
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our cover@@ t investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single top politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal .
it &apos;s about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability .
and in order to cope with this , we have to change the rules of the game .
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
that may sound very comfor@@ ting as if we could not do anything against it ; as if nothing ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful .
but as a native optim@@ ist , I see that something has begun to change .
over the past few years we have seen incidents towards more transparency , as far as the owners of companies are concerned .
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since then , the EU has entered central registers at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe , and who controls it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lag@@ ging behind .
representatives of both parties brought a draft bill in both parliament chambers , but this does not make progress we would like to see .
we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global .
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
we need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseu@@ do firms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need leaders who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency by laws . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; together we can finally end the transparency , which now allows this type of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
one day after I finished my design studies I made a res@@ ale sale .
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him for a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake asking him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I thought , &quot; Oh , man !
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das !
this is a small trunk !
&quot; &quot; &quot; then I heard say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do you know ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the blanket and thought , &quot; Oh man ! what did I burn there ?
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he &apos;s crazy ? &quot;
I got such a fear that I got out of bed on the toes at the door , and my bedroom door shut down .
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my point of view completely .
perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
to house people on my air mattress was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress .
let &apos;s take a leap , two years later ...
I am unemployed , almost broke , my ro@@ omm@@ ate draws and the rent is increased .
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought how to earn something . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and every morning breakfast .
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and set up as &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; AI@@ R@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for $ 20 on the air mattress on wooden floor .
they found it great , and we too .
I am sure that our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ettes ta@@ sted completely different because we made it for our guests .
we tou@@ red with them through the whole city . when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I started .
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent ?
things got rolling .
my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer .
we wanted to find out if this could be a business concept .
thus we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when a visit comes .
over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be the next big thing ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we waited for the ro@@ cket to ign@@ ite .
indeed , they do not .
nobody who is still in con@@ sol@@ ation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people .
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
when you have a problem , you ins@@ ist on the things you can do . we were able to design .
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience .
we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who never met before .
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
th@@ um@@ bs up when you &apos;re ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone .
give your relaxed phone to your left ro@@ omm@@ ate .
this quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home .
visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet .
how does it feel to keep the relaxed phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
so even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es cell phone ?
could you please preach on Twitter that he was can@@ did@@ ly for the office of the President ?
you can now return mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail about this experiment ?
what if your neighbor had first imagined with his name ; if he had told where he comes from , how his dog or his children are called ?
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well sprung mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decis@@ i@@ vely .
in the beginning we have done some things wrong .
it was hard for people to leave negative jud@@ gements .
in the end , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had left their assessments before making them online .
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we investigated how likely it is that people trust one another , depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence .
we trust the people most who are most similar to us .
the more differences we find , the less we trust .
this is a natural social bias .
it becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes .
but if you have more than ten , everything changes .
a good reputation ste@@ ers common ground .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
we also learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself .
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
if you tell too little , for example &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tell too much , for example : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with my mother -- -- -- &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the request is rather not accepted . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great works of art in your home ! I &apos;m on vacation with my family . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how can I create this degree of openness with design ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on what topics to write .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces towards strangers .
what we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to disp@@ ose of these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
first : unbeliev@@ ably good luck .
second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third , a need that had not been met before .
for us , the business is working very well .
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who haven &apos;t been allowed to celebrate parties or devast@@ ate homes .
hosts have left guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I participated in customer service . all calls came straight to my mobile phone .
I stood at the forefront when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I just think about it .
the dis@@ appointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
fortunately , there was only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays a problem .
for men trusted one another in law .
when trust works , won@@ dro@@ us works can be created .
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary surgery !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals .
J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save lives , even though they don &apos;t know one at all .
you drive in your own car to the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books past .
they can stay even longer without calcul@@ ating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so , of course , not every stay exp@@ ires .
but these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself :
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but to call it simply &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the thing is not fair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people create a part of themselves , and that changes everything .
if you travel today , it is easy to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic .
but what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions ?
what if at any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill out a thoroughly and show one of the districts that you have never heard before ;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would shape apartments from the ground up to the clas@@ h ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation .
in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun .
were now offered residents . students who were looking for a residence ,
were given to people whose children had moved out . In@@ cu@@ b@@ ator programs have been launched ,
to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . over our platform alone 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or even hosts tonight .
the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we didn &apos;t re@@ inv@@ ent the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work ?
apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust .
design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I find this amazing ,
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes me .
we know , of course , that design cannot solve any problem .
but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design in the near future .
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ?
or just a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not blame you for your negative impressions .
so the media represent people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra .
I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted ,
a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ ker@@ in ,
and I am a practicing spiritual Muslims .
but not like Lady G@@ aga , because , baby , I was not born .
I have decided to do so .
when I was 17 years old , I made the decision to ou@@ ten me .
no , not as a homosex@@ ual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my head cover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the funny thing was that at that time it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence , and against the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal .
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have strug@@ gled with the Quran .
I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed .
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication , deep@@ ening with every reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to wines .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you fully understands you , and yet somehow loves you ?
it feels like that .
later I married and started as all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had a child later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast at the end , looked up on the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot;
there was smoke , air@@ planes flew into buildings , people ran@@ ged from the buildings .
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical distur@@ b@@ ance ?
my shock quickly turned into rebellion .
why should you do something like that ?
I switched to the TV channel and heard : ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; Near Eastern descent ... &quot; ... &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ icious one .
the same day we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move into a new city and start post@@ graduate studies .
I remember , as we were sil@@ ently driving -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time dre@@ aded to be recognized as a Muslim .
we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and then , I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Be careful &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Do not be ashamed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and again the warnings were waiting : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que could be a goal . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I looked at the extensive coverage .
the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were held for Muslims , torn into the open and beat .
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to be able to explain itself constantly .
I have nothing against questions , I love questions .
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today we can actually hear people say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we mal@@ ignant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ignant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less , because the question is wrong .
like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the US &apos;s body , but a vital organ .
thank you !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans .
will the closing of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
there may be a few parking places free , but do not stop the terror .
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to a more toler@@ ant view of people of other beliefs and to show greater ci@@ vic participation .
and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques .
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or bed in front of a computer .
in the process of radic@@ alisation , one has found that it begins online . first , the person is cut off from their community , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a bra@@ in@@ washing that leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ it@@ or or a beli@@ ever .
if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop people to go to the mos@@ que .
some still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Kor@@ an .
when Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS .
but we would add ourselves to their imagination by acknowled@@ ging them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x cl@@ one with Christianity .
both groups maintain their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if you throw a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that makes them read in Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
he said the problem was just the opposite . every minister with whom she spoke , she sil@@ enced and told her that her wrath , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble .
inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution .
this Ima@@ m established the connection with God and her church .
instead of acc@@ using them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world .
what she learned in the mos@@ que kept her from joining the IS .
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ?
a study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen .
we rather accept an author@@ itarian regime , conformity and prejudi@@ ce .
a study shows that if you submit to test persons messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather agree with military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circum@@ cision of the rights of American Muslims .
this is not only an academic problem .
if you see when the mood sw@@ elled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it .
it can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all .
in the allocation of collective guilt , it is not only about explaining oneself .
De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple living in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school .
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
he was talented at the dental department , talented , promising ...
his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man she knew .
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when is such an accomplished young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page .
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can be not only im@@ moral , but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we staying safe at home ?
we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , as it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion .
we chose the mos@@ que .
with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mos@@ que .
I took him out , pulled off my shoes , went to the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop .
the hall was completely filled .
then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled members were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us .
at that moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had brought courage and sympathy with panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve .
but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , work in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule .
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you don &apos;t dec@@ eive . I &apos;m totally normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
when one looks at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world , people want ordinary things .
they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace .
so in no way I am an exception .
if people like an exception appear as a rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule .
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a milli@@ ard business .
control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide .
before air @-@ parcel order penet@@ rated our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ metre high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . a few years ago , they started to fly with ropes .
by connecting flights , flight units reach high speed and acceleration in a confined space .
you can also build independently load@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear bur@@ dens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to laws of nature .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to transc@@ end the limits of possible in an autonomous flight .
in order for a system to work autonom@@ ously , it has to know coll@@ ectively where the mobile objects are located .
in our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks .
for today &apos;s demo@@ s we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a branch of our laboratory .
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space , determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
external commands exist at the highest level . e. g. &quot; start &quot; and &quot; land . &quot;
this is a so @-@ called rear starter ,
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap .
like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations .
in contrast to most of the Star@@ r@@ flü@@ gl@@ ers , it can float , and thus has great advantages at start and landing , and is very versatile .
however , there is always a down@@ side .
a limitation of rear @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the flight unit no matter in what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research , we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter .
one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accum@@ ulate to hurt you .
decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flying devices , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder .
recently we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechanically saf@@ est remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently .
it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller ,
no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ bow , no further actuators or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller .
although it is mechanical simple , there is a lot happening inside the inside , so that it can fly stable and move around in the room .
nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern star@@ ters . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right .
the probability of throwing it right when I see everyone is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video filmed yesterday evening .
if the moon is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance .
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
in this way he receives the au@@ ral ability ,
moving in the room in all directions , no matter in which direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates .
of course it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers .
some things can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly from flying .
let us look at it .
when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they need to be extremely safe and reliable .
this machine is made up of two separate two prop@@ eller aircraft .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
when you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller is off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , even if restricted .
we will now demonstrate this by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression .
we took standard Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore , there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for guys like us lies the wage in the development and the act of creativity .
it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way .
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
1.3 billion years ago two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant galax@@ y , they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of pure energy .
this short moment they brigh@@ tened brigh@@ ter than all the stars in all the galax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set their energy freely in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded into gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events in time .
more than 1.3 billion years ago , multi @-@ cell life was born on Earth .
since then the earth has produced quite a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet .
about 25 years ago , a group of particularly cour@@ a@@ geous -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravit@@ ational @-@ waves , which occur approximately through colli@@ ding black holes .
most of them thought they were crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
after decades of development , construction , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer @-@ gravit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory .
in the following period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance .
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems .
on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gravit@@ ational waves of the two colli@@ ding black holes in the earth were ro@@ aring through the earth .
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ gh@@ ter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
that is why they were the fruits of my life .
AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gravit@@ ational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observations like lig@@ o meas@@ urable signals . but what are gravit@@ ational @-@ waves ?
a gravit@@ ational wave is a ri@@ p@@ pling in the structure of space and time .
when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other .
lec@@ turers in courses on theory of rel@@ ativity often lead to a really radical dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
the problem is that gravit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous .
on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ owed by us when the waves were met . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 .
that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a followed by 1 . therefore one explained the Lig@@ o staff for nuts .
with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that &apos;s already absurd , this length should be measured to less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucle@@ us . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque .
at the end of his classic text on gravity
described Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , hunting for waves in the following way : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success .
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
visible light has a wavel@@ ength that is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell .
this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you .
with sounds it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you :
the face of your child .
instead , we listen to certain features such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it .
&quot; now Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stupid Bob &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the same applies to gravit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
but by paying attention to changes in the ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories .
at least for Lig@@ o , the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
so when we trans@@ mu@@ te wave patterns in sound , we can literally hear the universe .
to listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision between two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time .
SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ ping : w@@ up@@ p !
if the two bodies are turning very fast , you can hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . this sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu !
it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form .
AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; surfing &apos;s noise &#93; Som@@ e@@ one who knows what to hear , recognize this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate about as fast as the sticks of your mixer .
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , rot@@ ates one hundred times a second before they colli@@ de .
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know this because we heard it .
therein lies the remaining meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to research the universe as it was never before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
much in space , we can &apos;t see -- practical or basically -- not .
a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ie stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ ae .
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
the exciting physical processes , however , occur at the core , which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon .
we will never see through this op@@ aque .
gravit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it since the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own offspring .
using gravit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
and the most important thing : I am optim@@ istic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening .
in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first run of things that we did not expect .
my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , like Lig@@ o they watch , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe .
they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are , so to speak , the Sau@@ ri@@ erk@@ no@@ chen for our archaeological work .
Lig@@ o gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos .
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos .
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
no , but yes !
did I want to be live on TV ?
no , but yes !
did I want to start playing ?
no , no , no , yes , yes , yes .
and a crazy thing happened : just to do what I was afraid of , removed my fear .
my fear of talking , my social anxiety -- p@@ uff , away .
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my life has changed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me .
but there was a definite yes , which changed my life deeply , to an un@@ expect@@ edly kind . it began with a question of my little ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
a new attitude to life in my family . from then on , I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I am doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time .
almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very busy .
it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things out , consider life .
dream job .
no . no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am TV . I produce TV .
I make television , in great style .
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time .
each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
a new episode every nine days four shows , so every nine days 20 million dollar television , four television programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television ,
350 million dollars for one season .
in America my tel@@ ev@@ isi@@ ons run one after the other on Thursday evening .
all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers .
my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories .
four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world .
do you know who is still doing that ?
no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan .
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with this .
I say it because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you are running a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a budget , take me seriously if I speak of work , so you understand that I don &apos;t just walk on the computer and fan@@ ciful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it &apos;s not going to dream with a dream job .
it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all silence -- no tears .
I work hard , hard and I love it .
when I go into work , there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country out of nowhere .
it is when I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
as a result , you get a high sound , deliver a marathon .
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the bu@@ zz .
there is such a change in me when work is going well .
a bu@@ zz starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the bu@@ zz sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on it .
many people accept when I declare to them the hum@@ ming that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing makes me happy .
don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does .
but the bu@@ zz -- when I began with television production when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this bu@@ zz , this energy .
sum@@ ming is more than writing .
the bu@@ zz is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is the voice of God in my ear .
and if you have such a sum , then you can &apos;t strive for size differently .
the feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn &apos;t matter at what price .
this is called the bu@@ zz .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is a genius .
maybe it &apos;s ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
I only know that I &apos;m not made for failure , and I only know that I love hum@@ ming .
I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
to make it clear : the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more things are , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there are .
the more I work to succeed , the more I have to work .
and what did I say about work ?
I love work , isn &apos;t it ?
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming .
I like this hum@@ ming . I love hum@@ ming .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
revised , over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , burned out .
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mo@@ m won &apos;t be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; No , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the children of Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the bu@@ zz@@ ing ceased .
the bu@@ zz@@ ing of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my job anymore . the engine was off .
the hum@@ ming did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
I did the same things as always : the same title work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ated , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever .
but there was no bu@@ zz .
in me was silence .
four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four .
four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ...
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a Pre @-@ Show @-@ Titan ,
everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore .
and that was my life .
all I did .
I was the bu@@ zz@@ ing and the bu@@ zz@@ ing was me .
so what do you do if what you do , the work you love suddenly fade away ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know you do what you &apos;re doing , you &apos;re working , you love what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a pa@@ inters , Bill Gates , you just love another and that knows how the bu@@ zz feels when you already knew the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ?
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ?
and then my &quot; southern wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am on the way out , late at it and she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I want to say no , when two things become aware of me :
first , I must say Yes to all and second , she did not call me &quot; estim@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she calls no more &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; estim@@ ations &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when is this happening ?
I miss it when I am Titan and my hum@@ ming bet@@ s , and here everything changes before my own eyes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and I say , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , lon@@ el@@ iness and lack of hum@@ ming , I can do nothing except to watch out .
I am focused .
I &apos;m quiet .
the country I created , the marathon I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist .
all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , vig@@ il@@ ance pen@@ cils and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl release in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost enters .
and that not immediately , but it happens it happens .
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly comes back .
no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there .
not the bu@@ zz@@ ing , but a hum@@ ming .
and now I feel like I know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming of the titanium , this is only the replacement .
if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself using programs and TV @-@ hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is .
the bu@@ zz is not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
true hum@@ ming depends on love .
the bu@@ zz is the current that comes from the lust for life .
true hum@@ ming is self @-@ confidence and peace .
the real bu@@ zz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure .
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
the real hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ?
it &apos;s just love .
we all need a little more love , much more love .
as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes .
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from all guilt as a work@@ ah@@ olic .
it is law , I have no other choice . I have no other choice , if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again .
I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it .
I don &apos;t care about how to work .
the truth hur@@ ts ,
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to work at the workplace than at home .
this admission is painful , because what a person does better work than to be a home ?
well , I .
hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; --
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is not one of them .
we move around in the garden , before and back , back and forth .
we make small dance parties ,
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused .
I will always go to my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me .
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
maybe hold me for na@@ ive , for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
you &apos;re right , but you can do it too !
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is just 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different .
it is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes .
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuits replaces me .
and if my teen@@ ie daughter is talking with me for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year .
there are only 15 minutes , more does not need it .
everyone can pick up 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood day !
15 minutes per piece !
no mobile , no clothes , no distra@@ ction .
the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray .
but 15 minutes are inside !
my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it doesn &apos;t have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for peace of mind .
it &apos;s not about playing with your children . it &apos;s about joy ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; to play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; games &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general . &quot; &quot; &quot;
give yourself the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and store it .
I &apos;m not perfect in it . I fail and I win . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to beat myself more and more . &quot; &quot; &quot;
15 minutes on the piece , why not allow for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the bu@@ zz came back in my spare time . the bu@@ zz seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without playing .
it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear an unknown melody , she fills me and my soul . she bin@@ ds me to new ideas . I use it to the ful@@ lest and love my work again .
I like hum@@ ming , but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I am not the bu@@ zz , the hum@@ ming is not me ... no more .
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends .
this is my bu@@ zz .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the hum@@ ming of love .
the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that .
I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan while travelling to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children .
the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother .
the more I play , the more clear my head is .
the more I play , the better I work .
the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country I created , the marathon I run , the troops , the screens , the high tone , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right hum@@ ming : the bu@@ zz@@ ing of life .
the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , lasting , naked and new attitude of life is growing in me . less Titan -- more I !
the more I feel exactly this sum , the more I know who I am .
I &apos;m the author . I think things out , I consider you to live .
that belongs to the job , which means living his dream .
this is the dream of this job ,
because a dream job should be a bit dre@@ amy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I said &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to work less and more games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or a car accident .
for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing .
after severe injury of the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability .
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures .
they have certainly heard of one of the most well @-@ known , the &quot; deep brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ planted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons &quot; circu@@ it@@ ry in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved .
it truly is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease suffering from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
with some help , the brain can help itself .
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room .
I often supplied patients with brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that the brain is sw@@ inging to the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
in order to save life , you have to reduce the pressure of the skull .
for this you sometimes need to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist to analyze the brain mass .
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families .
you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve .
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was able to do so .
he saw this under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
it looked exactly as a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , mature cells .
perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism .
the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain .
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die , they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks , they even died .
we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently .
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ bl@@ ec@@ or@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fo@@ et@@ us stage , they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why are they kept ?
we don &apos;t know that .
we believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations .
but this is not so safe .
one thing is clear however -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain .
in the final step we re @-@ planted them at the removal point of the same individual .
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ t -- aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ implant these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys .
in the first scenario we imported the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the room is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear .
in the second scenario we added an injury and re @-@ imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we dy@@ ed in vitro , in the culture .
of course we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained Mon@@ keys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take feed pellets of a tray .
they made it very good .
when they reached a stable skill level , we injured the motor skills area in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex .
then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand anymore .
just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke .
patients are paraly@@ zed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with the monkey .
when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted his own cells .
on the left you see the monkey , who recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the rice plant@@ ation .
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze it and use it later .
we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models such as Parkinson &apos;s disease .
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her in man .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bruno Giussani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know someone who can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I definitely do .
of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans .
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results one needs about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate and so on .
J@@ B : yeah , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team .
BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials . if you continue looking into the future , how many years it takes for someone to come to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will the authority permit us to start it soon ?
then this study must be carried out with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
after that , you have to apply this to a multic@@ entre study .
you must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for visiting TE@@ D and that you told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society .
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable ge@@ dness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
in fact , democracy wan@@ es with us , in Europe .
at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear to me as finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece .
at that moment , I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my re@@ belli@@ ous friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be aboli@@ shed when it would change anything .
at this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy .
I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ umb to a mis@@ belief , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ en@@ sel@@ ess democracy .
without democracy our societies are bl@@ amed , our future ble@@ ak and our great , new technologies are wa@@ sted .
on the subject of waste I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threat@@ ens our economies .
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which casts his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world .
we all know the mountain of debt ,
but few recognize his twin .
a mountain of unt@@ apped cash , which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations , which are too fear@@ ful to invest there where it would be productive and income which could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example green energy .
I call them two numbers .
over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollars have been invested in the U.S. , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on .
3,@@ 4 tril@@ lion US dollar accounts for a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it to the $ 5.1 tril@@ lion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing except to infl@@ ate stock exchanges and to promote real estate prices .
thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms .
the result is stag@@ gering wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , rein@@ forces the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who , by fear , the prophecy of the ro@@ cket could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up ,
invol@@ un@@ tarily , the circumstances cause the body to kill it .
this is my hair with capitalism --
all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth .
is democracy the solution ?
but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as majority control the government .
the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy naturally closed too many --
women , foreigners , and of course slaves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the importance of ath@@ en@@ ical democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decisive thing about the ath@@ en@@ ish democracy was and is that she kept the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , giving them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voting rights in questions of state interests .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
like a candle that shines brigh@@ tly , it is quickly burned out .
however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens ,
but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution .
while the ath@@ en@@ ical democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which was ultimately a statute for rulers .
for the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was im@@ planted on politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone .
in our current demo@@ cra@@ cies there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , as the economy gradually emig@@ rated and deprived them of politics .
wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not a degeneration of its DNA .
it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is diver@@ ted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my sh@@ arks with capitalism .
if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ors that sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds on , that at the end it star@@ ves .
it is similar to the economy that has chann@@ eled politics so far that it har@@ ms itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , the ine@@ quality falling , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies .
the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well @-@ being of humanity .
if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demo@@ s &quot; keep control , as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners .
by the way , this is not a new idea .
the Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go out very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only reg@@ ain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is one solution : to aboli@@ sh the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots .
the problem is , as long as economics and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks grow higher , the waste of subli@@ me , and social conflicts lower , as I believe -- very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China .
so we have to re@@ design the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we demo@@ crati@@ ze the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in a path@@ ological monitoring hyp@@ er that makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; a documentary .
the question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --
the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines serve humans and humans invest their energy into the exploration of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ian &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life .
I think we must be optim@@ istic .
so what would it look like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; @-@ like utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; Matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
in practical implementation I would like to give you , in brief , some examples .
in the field of companies , please introduce a capital market where money is earned while working and in which your capital flows from one place to another , from one company to another , and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company .
then all revenues from capital and revenues originate and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led .
no distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees working there , but which the company does not belong . no more exchange between capital and labour , no large gaps between investment and saving , and ultimately no lifting twin peaks .
in the field of global political economy , please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity .
imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund .
&quot; &quot; &quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; green &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed at the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference in 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
today we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy .
the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which they preferred privileged people , and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , globally Key@@ nes@@ ian .
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
we will aw@@ aken in such a world
&quot; &quot; &quot; or are we going to sink into a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
it is in our hands , and we do it better demo@@ crati@@ cally .
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
in your biography you describe yourself as a liberal Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant .
the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive drop in overall economic demand , which ter@@ med Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers as &quot; long term stagn@@ ation . &quot;
by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low .
if this analysis is true , Marx is quite relevant ,
just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liberal Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am totally s@@ wir@@ ling .
BG : in fact , and now we are .
Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough .
BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the or@@ ators you have said very clearly what you think from the West &apos;s point of view in China .
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy .
as I said in my speech , we have limited the democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic @-@ free zone .
in a certain sense , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is today similar to the England of the 19th century .
for -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is a mistake , historically regarded .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill ,
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
what we can see now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second .
now propos@@ ing China to do what the West has done in the 19th century sm@@ ells of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that &apos;s coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone ,
not only Greece , but the Eurozone ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to say good @-@ bye to ourselves and the long @-@ lasting den@@ ial that a massive throw @-@ away line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to be mas@@ sively threatened by the development of the whole European Union . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this den@@ ial --
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , have continued to choose the den@@ ial . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
if you try to get an economic system that is not viable , through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you may be able to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive .
BG : what changes do you anticip@@ ate ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ...
if there is a minister of finance , or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then that is a dangerous person .
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that didn &apos;t exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the distor@@ tions running through the Eurozone .
they did not want to conc@@ ede that for 5 years they had passed through a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
it is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; none of the tro@@ ika who imposed on us this policy was : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be still pro @-@ European .
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union .
this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy .
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
if we allow ourselves to propose the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , what appears to me , it will also be det@@ ri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans .
BG : we hope you &apos;re wrong at this point .
Yan@@ is , thank you for being at TE@@ D .
Y@@ V : thank you .
von Roy Price has never heard the majority , although it is probably responsible for 22 medi@@ oc@@ re minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 .
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios ,
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ hair@@ style and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Films , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry .
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
he has to find shows which are very , very good .
in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve .
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this review .
if your show is valued at nine and higher , this will be a winner .
then you have a successful show .
these are shows like Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where is there any more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what goes on at this end of the curve .
Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to prohi@@ bit &quot; to@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
he makes more thoughts about the mean output , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire .
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
the pressure is present and of course it is also the first time that Amazon does something , so Roy Price does not want to risk anything .
he wants to create success .
he needs guaranteed success , so he considers a competition .
he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch them for free .
and if Amazon comes out for nothing , how do you pick it up , right ?
millions of viewers are watching these episodes .
however , they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows .
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
you record when you start the show when you pause , which parts you jump over or watch again .
they collect millions of data to then decide which show they should produce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
they did this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good .
it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a bit above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked .
approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it , but it makes it a bit different .
instead of organizing a competition , he and his team have watched the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the reviews they give the shows their course of which shows they like etc .
then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors .
when they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but rather a drama series about a Sen@@ ator .
do you know this show ?
yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons .
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
of course , the question is : what has happened here ?
one has two very competitive , data sealed companies .
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
if you collect millions of data for a decision you encounter , you should make a good decision .
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it optimi@@ zes it through very powerful computers .
the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ?
if data analysis does not work this way , this is somewhat frigh@@ tening because we live in a time when we use more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television .
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
no one . OK , that &apos;s even good .
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison .
if someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not .
just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
moderate television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse .
unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data ,
not always the best results are produced . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also wrong .
yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes .
in 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis breaks of flu , the bad way , they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches .
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success cul@@ min@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
it worked flaw@@ lessly , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore ,
and no one could say why .
it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
despite all these errors , data flows into decisions of life - at the workplace , in the law enforcement , in medicine .
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use in@@ concei@@ v@@ ably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
or the development of a medicine . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things :
first you dis@@ assemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the components ; as a second , you put the items together again to make a decision .
sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again .
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts .
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it &apos;s the brain of an expert .
that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and understanding , where they also belong in the process .
they use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data .
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show , which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way .
they used data to control all their decisions , first as they compete for TV ideas , then when they chose &quot; alpha House &quot; as a show .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they tell us the data . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
data are helpful for better decisions but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions .
no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful .
many of you will ...
before there was any data , this was the device for decisions .
many know it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a j@@ a- or no @-@ issue you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most likely &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I will fight it later with a technique demo .
so far I have made some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in retro@@ sp@@ ect .
but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions .
but this does not alter the basic structure .
so maybe the ball will be smar@@ ter and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner .
and I feel this is very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing , and taking risks .
because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve .
thank you very much .
