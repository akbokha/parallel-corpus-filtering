<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize in New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">Long before anyone had heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA had heard illegal phones of Americans.</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation, in which the CIA literally delivered drafts to Iran for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">If that sounds crazy, read it.</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">For almost 10 years the government has been investigating rifts and called upon him to call his alleged sources.</seg>
<seg id="11">In this turn he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists.</seg>
<seg id="12">According to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information.</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right if media do not receive this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal.</seg>
<seg id="14">So when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many brave reporters did before him: he refused and said that he would rather go to jail.</seg>
<seg id="15">From 2007 to 2015, risons lived with the risk of going into prison.</seg>
<seg id="16">But then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened.</seg>
<seg id="17">Suddenly, although they were assuming for years that it would be essential in their case, the demands of the government were dropped to cracks.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">Instead of failure and risking to make statements, this could also do his digital footprints for him.</seg>
<seg id="20">And so the investigators, without his consent, have been secretly anxious about his telephony.</seg>
<seg id="21">Just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, his credit information, and even travel documents with the list of his flights.</seg>
<seg id="22">In the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey sterling, a CIA whistleblower and crack.</seg>
<seg id="23">Unfortunately, this is only one of many cases.</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary condemned him more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret.</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">So we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on everyone.</seg>
<seg id="28">But just as the government's technology allows to bypass the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources.</seg>
<seg id="29">And they can do that from the moment they get in touch, rather than in retrospect, in the stuff.</seg>
<seg id="30">Today there are communication software that has not yet existed when cracking had written his book, and it is much safer than normal e-mails or phone calls.</seg>
<seg id="31">Such a technology is SecureDrop, an open source translation system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the Internet-renowned Aaron Swartz, and has been developed today by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work.</seg>
<seg id="32">Instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, like the one here of the Washington Post.</seg>
<seg id="33">There you can upload documents or send information, just as with any normal contact form.</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">So the government can no longer collect information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset.</seg>
<seg id="36">SecureDrop is but a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">Unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that jeopardize us all.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "it is up to us to ensure that not only technology designers such as Edward Snowden have a chance to make misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistleblower," ""</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report abuses in the care of soldiers and wants to report about overcrowded hospitals. or the next environmental officer who suggests flint to the polluted water. or a Wall Street Insider who warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">At least these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights.</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on April 3, 2016 the largest data leak in history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and mighty] [enormous sums of money] have hidden [enormous sums of money in tax havens.] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] this week we were sent by news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mossack Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">We get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say: "okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that?"</seg>
<seg id="45">We actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works.</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's prime minister resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Baschar al-Assad letterbox firms has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">It is said that a track of $2 billion will lead to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist.</seg>
<seg id="50">Now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others who wait nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents.</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent's killer or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">It seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people.</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">But the truth is that if the rich and powerful are able to hide their fortunes in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services like healthcare, education, roads.</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">For my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal.</seg>
<seg id="57">Media and leading politicians all over the world discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years.</seg>
<seg id="58">I think many people seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work.</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">So you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these signs.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are fewer reports in the USA about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">Probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who were present in these revelations, this scandal.</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">However, by the principle that these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has less American customers.</seg>
<seg id="66">If we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have connections to the US.</seg>
<seg id="67">In fact, it is so that in some U.S. states you need less information to give less information to found a company than to get a library card.</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">This allows scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">Our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet.</seg>
<seg id="75">"" "" "" "we really shocked that everyone up to a lawyer made suggestions on how he could transfer his money." ""</seg>
<seg id="76">None of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. but it shows the problem with this system.</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted suggestions to our covert investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single top politician, involved in a scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">It's about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability.</seg>
<seg id="81">And in order to cope with this, we have to change the rules of the game.</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">That may sound very comforting as if we could not do anything against it; as if nothing ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful.</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a native optimist, I see that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">Over the past few years we have seen incidents towards more transparency, as far as the owners of companies are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"" "" "" "since then, the EU has entered central registers at national level, who really is behind firms in Europe, and who controls it." ""</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is lagging behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">Representatives of both parties brought a draft bill in both parliament chambers, but this does not make progress we would like to see.</seg>
<seg id="90">We would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global.</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind pseudo firms.</seg>
<seg id="93">"" "we need leaders in the economy who stand up and say:" "" "transparency is not good for business." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "we need leaders who recognize the problem and use it to end this kind of transparency by laws." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "" "" "together we can finally end the transparency, which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering." ""</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">One day after I finished my design studies I made a resale sale.</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him for a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "while we paid the bill, I made the mistake asking him:" "" "where do you sleep tonight?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"" "he made the whole thing even worse:" "" "I don't know yet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="105">And I thought, "Oh, man!</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">But I just got to know him! he says he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"" "then I heard say," "" "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="112">"" "a voice in my head said," "" "Do you know?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="113">At night I lay in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought, "Oh man! what did I burn there?</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he's crazy? "</seg>
<seg id="116">I got such a fear that I got out of bed on the toes at the door, and my bedroom door shut down.</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my point of view completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">To house people on my air mattress was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="123">Let's take a leap, two years later...</seg>
<seg id="124">I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate draws and the rent is increased.</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky: "Brian, I thought how to earn something. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and every morning breakfast.</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and set up as "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for $20 on the air mattress on wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great, and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I am sure that our cheese-ham-omelettes tasted completely different because we made it for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">We toured with them through the whole city. when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I started.</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and were able to pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things got rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">My former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer.</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if this could be a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">Thus we presented to the investors: "we want to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when a visit comes.</seg>
<seg id="139">Over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "that will be the next big thing!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed, they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">Nobody who is still in consolation would invest in a business that allows strangers to sleep in apartments of other people.</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">When you have a problem, you insist on the things you can do. we were able to design.</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just appearance and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">We had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who never met before.</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you're ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like you to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your relaxed phone to your left roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">Visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet.</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the relaxed phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Just so, who actually has Al Gores cell phone?</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please preach on Twitter that he was candidly for the office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">What if your neighbor had first imagined with his name; if he had told where he comes from, how his dog or his children are called?</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold on very well sprung mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we have done some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to leave negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">In the end, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had left their assessments before making them online.</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we investigated how likely it is that people trust one another, depending on how similar they are in terms of age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">We trust the people most who are most similar to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find, the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It becomes exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">If you have less than three judgements, nothing changes.</seg>
<seg id="183">But if you have more than ten, everything changes.</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation steers common ground.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">We also learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself.</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">If you tell too little, for example "Hi!," you don't get an answer.</seg>
<seg id="189">"" "tell too much, for example:" "" "I have problems with my mother -- -- --" "" "the request is rather not accepted." ""</seg>
<seg id="190">"" "so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "" "great works of art in your home! I'm on vacation with my family." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create this degree of openness with design?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on what topics to write.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices towards strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not expect was the great amount of people who were more than willing to dispose of these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: unbelievably good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second, the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third, a need that had not been met before.</seg>
<seg id="200">For us, the business is working very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who haven't been allowed to celebrate parties or devastate homes.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have left guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I participated in customer service. all calls came straight to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the forefront when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I just think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">Fortunately, there was only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays a problem.</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trusted one another in law.</seg>
<seg id="210">When trust works, wondrous works can be created.</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary surgery!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect home for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with adequate hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save lives, even though they don't know one at all.</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive in your own car to the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">Because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books past.</seg>
<seg id="220">They can stay even longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So, of course, not every stay expires.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">When I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"" "but to call it simply" "" "rental industry" "", "the thing is not fair." ""</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People create a part of themselves, and that changes everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">If you travel today, it is easy to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic.</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling were a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">What if at any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill out a thoroughly and show one of the districts that you have never heard before;</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would shape apartments from the ground up to the clash?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">In South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun.</seg>
<seg id="240">Were now offered residents. students who were looking for a residence,</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children had moved out. Incubator programs have been launched,</seg>
<seg id="242">To finance new start-ups in the Share economy. over our platform alone 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or even hosts tonight.</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work?</seg>
<seg id="248">Apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust.</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deeply rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find this amazing,</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know, of course, that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">But if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design in the near future.</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or just a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media represent people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of the reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double espresso, with cream extra.</seg>
<seg id="270">I'm introverted,</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatikerin,</seg>
<seg id="272">And I am a practicing spiritual Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="273">But not like Lady Gaga, because, baby, I was not born.</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old, I made the decision to outen me.</seg>
<seg id="276">No, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my head cover.</seg>
<seg id="277">"" "my feminist friends were horrified:" "" "why do you suppress yourself?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="278">The funny thing was that at that time it was a feminist declaration of independence, and against the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have struggled with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed.</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow dedication, deepening with every reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm sometimes brings me to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">Did you ever feel that someone perceives you fully understands you, and yet somehow loves you?</seg>
<seg id="287">It feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">Later I married and started as all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer.</seg>
<seg id="289">"" "I had a child later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" "" "Egyptian-American Dream" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast at the end, looked up on the screen and saw the word "breaking news."</seg>
<seg id="293">There was smoke, airplanes flew into buildings, people ranged from the buildings.</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disturbance?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should you do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">I switched to the TV channel and heard:... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "Near Eastern descent..."... "jihad..."... "bombed Mecca!"</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">Not only my country was attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspicious one.</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move into a new city and start postgraduate studies.</seg>
<seg id="303">I remember, as we were silently driving -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time dreaded to be recognized as a Muslim.</seg>
<seg id="304">We moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world.</seg>
<seg id="305">"" "and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" "" "be watchful," "" "Be careful" "", "" "" "Abide in well lit areas," "" "" "" "Do not be ashamed." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday in that week -- the day when Muslims gather to pray.</seg>
<seg id="308">"" "and again the warnings were waiting:" "" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="309">I looked at the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">The feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or of people who were held for Muslims, torn into the open and beat.</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">"" "" "" "I've got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists." ""</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to be able to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">I have nothing against questions, I love questions.</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"" "today we can actually hear people say:" "" "there is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims." ""</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless, because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">Like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the US's body, but a vital organ.</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">There may be a few parking places free, but do not stop the terror.</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to a more tolerant view of people of other beliefs and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">And as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques.</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">In the process of radicalisation, one has found that it begins online. first, the person is cut off from their community, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brainwashing that leads the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or a believer.</seg>
<seg id="336">If we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop people to go to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">Finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="339">When Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS.</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imagination by acknowledging them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clone with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups maintain their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"" "but if you throw a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" "" "Holy Scripture." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that makes them read in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">He said the problem was just the opposite. every minister with whom she spoke, she silenced and told her that her wrath, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble.</seg>
<seg id="350">Inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalization by extremists who promised her a solution.</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam established the connection with God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">Instead of accusing them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world.</seg>
<seg id="353">What she learned in the mosque kept her from joining the IS.</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24 hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">A study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">We rather accept an authoritarian regime, conformity and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="360">A study shows that if you submit to test persons messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they rather agree with military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you see when the mood swelled against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">So Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected it.</seg>
<seg id="365">It can actually be a tool for the manipulation of the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">We may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all.</seg>
<seg id="368">In the allocation of collective guilt, it is not only about explaining oneself.</seg>
<seg id="369">Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple living in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school.</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">He was talented at the dental department, talented, promising...</seg>
<seg id="372">His sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man she knew.</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "" "" "when is such an accomplished young man from my brother?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">Only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution after he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can be not only immoral, but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">We discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, as it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion.</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">With our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="384">I took him out, pulled off my shoes, went to the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">Then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled members were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us.</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had brought courage and sympathy with panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">But I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with a draught, work in a noble thought factory, so an exception and not the rule.</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">Dalia Mogahed: I would say that you don't deceive. I'm totally normal.</seg>
<seg id="399">I am no exception.</seg>
<seg id="400">My story is not unusual.</seg>
<seg id="401">I am as usual as it is allowed.</seg>
<seg id="402">When one looks at Muslims around the world, and I did that with the greatest ever conducted study on Muslims all over the world, people want ordinary things.</seg>
<seg id="403">They want prosperity for the family, they want work and they want to live in peace.</seg>
<seg id="404">So in no way I am an exception.</seg>
<seg id="405">If people like an exception appear as a rule, then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule.</seg>
<seg id="406">HW: thank you. Dalia Mogahed.</seg>
<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a milliard business.</seg>
<seg id="408">Control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="409">Before air-parcel order penetrated our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-metre high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. a few years ago, they started to fly with ropes.</seg>
<seg id="410">By connecting flights, flight units reach high speed and acceleration in a confined space.</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally respond to laws of nature.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to transcend the limits of possible in an autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">In order for a system to work autonomously, it has to know collectively where the mobile objects are located.</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">For today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a branch of our laboratory.</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in space, determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">External commands exist at the highest level. e. g. "start" and "land."</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called rear starter,</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">Like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations.</seg>
<seg id="424">In contrast to most of the Starrflüglers, it can float, and thus has great advantages at start and landing, and is very versatile.</seg>
<seg id="425">However, there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the flight unit no matter in what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research, we often ask ourselves fundamental abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts that accumulate to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">Decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remotely controlled flying devices, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder.</seg>
<seg id="435">Recently we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner, the mechanically safest remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">It has only a moving part, a propeller,</seg>
<seg id="438">No flaps, hinges and crossbow, no further actuators or controller surfaces, only one propeller.</seg>
<seg id="439">Although it is mechanical simple, there is a lot happening inside the inside, so that it can fly stable and move around in the room.</seg>
<seg id="440">Nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern starters. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right.</seg>
<seg id="441">The probability of throwing it right when I see everyone is low, so I'll show you a video filmed yesterday evening.</seg>
<seg id="442">If the moon is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance.</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">In this way he receives the aural ability,</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in the room in all directions, no matter in which direction it is rotated or even how it rotates.</seg>
<seg id="448">Of course it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers.</seg>
<seg id="449">Some things can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly from flying.</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at it.</seg>
<seg id="451">When flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they need to be extremely safe and reliable.</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two propeller aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">When you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">But if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller is off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, even if restricted.</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">The large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression.</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard Micro-Quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore, there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For guys like us lies the wage in the development and the act of creativity.</seg>
<seg id="466">It serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way.</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">1.3 billion years ago two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, they turned the mass of three suns in a tenth of pure energy.</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they brightened brighter than all the stars in all the galaxies of the entire universe known to us.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set their energy freely in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded into gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events in time.</seg>
<seg id="476">More than 1.3 billion years ago, multi-cell life was born on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">Since then the earth has produced quite a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God is standing at us -- even the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="478">About 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to search for gravitational-waves, which occur approximately through colliding black holes.</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">After decades of development, construction, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer-gravitational-waves observatory.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the following period, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance.</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">At the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to solve some minor, persistent problems.</seg>
<seg id="485">On September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes in the earth were roaring through the earth.</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">That is why they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes for 23 years and their observations like ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a rippling in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">When passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and into the other.</seg>
<seg id="495">Lecturers in courses on theory of relativity often lead to a really radical dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">The problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="498">On September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stowed by us when the waves were met. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21.</seg>
<seg id="499">That means 20 zeros after the comma followed by 1. therefore one explained the Ligo staff for nuts.</seg>
<seg id="500">With a five-kilometer laser detector, and that's already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. that's grotesque.</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">Described Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, hunting for waves in the following way: "the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous.</seg>
<seg id="503">"" "but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">Visible light has a wavelength that is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell.</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">That is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child.</seg>
<seg id="513">Instead, we listen to certain features such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it.</seg>
<seg id="514">"now Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"" "" "" "stupid Bob" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">But by paying attention to changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories.</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo, the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">So when we transmute wave patterns in sound, we can literally hear the universe.</seg>
<seg id="522">To listen to the gravity can tell us about the collision between two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirping: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">If the two bodies are turning very fast, you can hear the same circus with an additional key change. this sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [surfing's noise] Someone who knows what to hear, recognize this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate about as fast as the sticks of your mixer.</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">Two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, rotates one hundred times a second before they collide.</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know this because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the remaining meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to research the universe as it was never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space, we can't see -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">A supernova, for example. I would like to know why masserie stars explode in supernovae.</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">The exciting physical processes, however, occur at the core, which lies behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon.</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through this opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">Gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it since the Big Bang is covered by its own offspring.</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravitational-waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">And the most important thing: I am optimistic that there exist in all things that we have never seen before, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening.</seg>
<seg id="543">In fact, Ligo found things right in the first run of things that we did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="544">My colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, like Ligo they watch, are the dinosaurs of the universe.</seg>
<seg id="545">They are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are, so to speak, the Saurierknochen for our archaeological work.</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo gives us a completely different angle of view of the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we came out of this chaos.</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">No, but yes!</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing?</seg>
<seg id="562">No, no, no, yes, yes, yes.</seg>
<seg id="563">And a crazy thing happened: just to do what I was afraid of, removed my fear.</seg>
<seg id="564">My fear of talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away.</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"" "" "" "yes," "" "my life has changed." ""</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a definite yes, which changed my life deeply, to an unexpectedly kind. it began with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"" "I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "" "kitten" "", "for inexplicable reasons." ""</seg>

<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">A new attitude to life in my family. from then on, I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I am doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time.</seg>
<seg id="575">Almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very busy.</seg>

<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things out, consider life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No. no.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream TV. I produce TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">I make television, in great style.</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">A new episode every nine days four shows, so every nine days 20 million dollar television, four television programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for one season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my televisions run one after the other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">All over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers.</seg>
<seg id="595">My brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories.</seg>
<seg id="596">Four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world.</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing that?</seg>
<seg id="598">No one, that's why I'm a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with this.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think, when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">I tell you that all of you who work so hard whether you are running a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a budget, take me seriously if I speak of work, so you understand that I don't just walk on the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it's not going to dream with a dream job.</seg>
<seg id="603">It's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all silence -- no tears.</seg>
<seg id="604">I work hard, hard and I love it.</seg>
<seg id="605">When I go into work, there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nowhere.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is when I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">As a result, you get a high sound, deliver a marathon.</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">She is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">A buzz starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on it.</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the humming that I'm talking about writing that writing makes me happy.</seg>
<seg id="616">Don't understand me wrong, it does.</seg>
<seg id="617">But the buzz -- when I began with television production when I began to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy.</seg>
<seg id="618">Summing is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">And if you have such a sum, then you can't strive for size differently.</seg>
<seg id="623">The feeling of not being different than striving for size doesn't matter at what price.</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is a genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it's ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">I only know that I'm not made for failure, and I only know that I love humming.</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">To make it clear: the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more things are, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there are.</seg>
<seg id="633">The more I work to succeed, the more I have to work.</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the humming, the humming, the humming.</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this humming. I love humming.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">Revised, overloaded, overloaded, burned out.</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom won't be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"" "and Emerson says," "" "No, I want to go to Shonda country." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">They were 12, 3 and 1, when the buzzing ceased.</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzzing of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my job anymore. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The humming did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">I did the same things as always: the same title work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegated, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever.</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">Four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four.</seg>
<seg id="657">Four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time...</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a Pre-Show-Titan,</seg>
<seg id="660">Everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore.</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">All I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzzing and the buzzing was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">So what do you do if what you do, the work you love suddenly fade away?</seg>
<seg id="665">"" "I know some may think:" "" "Heul, stupid author Titan." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="666">But you know you do what you're doing, you're working, you love what you're doing to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painters, Bill Gates, you just love another and that knows how the buzz feels when you already knew the buzz when the buzz stops, who is you then?</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">When the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"" "I am on the way out, late at it and she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no, when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">First, I must say Yes to all and second, she did not call me "estimations."</seg>
<seg id="675">"" "she calls no more" "" "estimations" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">I miss it when I am Titan and my humming bets, and here everything changes before my own eyes.</seg>
<seg id="678">"" "and so she says," "" "Mum, do you like to play?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="679">"" "and I say," "" "Yes." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">We play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book "Everybody Poops."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">But it is outstanding because my pain and panic, loneliness and lack of humming, I can do nothing except to watch out.</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">The country I created, the marathon I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist.</seg>
<seg id="687">All that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, vigilance pencils and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl release in "The Ice Queen."</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost enters.</seg>
<seg id="695">And that not immediately, but it happens it happens.</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">No full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there.</seg>
<seg id="699">Not the buzzing, but a humming.</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">The humming, the humming, the humming of the titanium, this is only the replacement.</seg>
<seg id="706">If I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself using programs and TV-hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is.</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">True humming depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">True humming is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">The real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure.</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">The real humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="715">It's just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">We all need a little more love, much more love.</seg>
<seg id="717">As soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from all guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law, I have no other choice. I have no other choice, if I want to hear the humming again.</seg>
<seg id="720">I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it.</seg>
<seg id="721">I don't care about how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth hurts,</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">This admission is painful, because what a person does better work than to be a home?</seg>
<seg id="727">Well, I.</seg>
<seg id="728">Honestly, I call myself "Titan" --</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is not one of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">We move around in the garden, before and back, back and forth.</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties,</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused.</seg>
<seg id="736">I will always go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">My children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me.</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe hold me for naive, for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">You're right, but you can do it too!</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something different.</seg>
<seg id="748">It is wonderful 15 minutes but just 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuits replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">And if my teenie daughter is talking with me for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year.</seg>
<seg id="751">There are only 15 minutes, more does not need it.</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can pick up 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood day!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes per piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">No mobile, no clothes, no distraction.</seg>
<seg id="755">The day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray.</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">My children are my well-being, my world. it doesn't have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for peace of mind.</seg>
<seg id="758">It's not about playing with your children. it's about joy,</seg>
<seg id="759">"" "to play" "" "games" "" "in general." ""</seg>
<seg id="760">Give yourself the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and store it.</seg>
<seg id="763">I'm not perfect in it. I fail and I win. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --</seg>
<seg id="764">"" "" "" "do you want to play?" "" "just for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I became a Titan in the training when I wanted to beat myself more and more." ""</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the piece, why not allow for full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">It takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear an unknown melody, she fills me and my soul. she binds me to new ideas. I use it to the fullest and love my work again.</seg>
<seg id="770">I like humming, but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the humming is not me... no more.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The humming of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">The sum of the work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="778">I don't know that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan while travelling to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">The more I play, the happier I and my children.</seg>
<seg id="782">The more I play, the more I feel as a good mother.</seg>
<seg id="783">The more I play, the more clear my head is.</seg>
<seg id="784">The more I play, the better I work.</seg>
<seg id="785">The more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country I created, the marathon I run, the troops, the screens, the high tone, the humming, the other, the right humming: the buzzing of life.</seg>
<seg id="786">The more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, lasting, naked and new attitude of life is growing in me. less Titan -- more I!</seg>
<seg id="787">The more I feel exactly this sum, the more I know who I am.</seg>
<seg id="788">I'm the author. I think things out, I consider you to live.</seg>
<seg id="789">That belongs to the job, which means living his dream.</seg>
<seg id="790">This is the dream of this job,</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a bit dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"" "I said" "" "Yes" "" "to work less and more games." ""</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a severe stroke or a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">For us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing.</seg>
<seg id="800">After severe injury of the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability.</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">They have certainly heard of one of the most well-known, the "deep brain stimulation." in doing so, one implanted an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neurons "circuitry in such a way that the neurological function is improved.</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease suffering from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help, the brain can help itself.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior doctor and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often supplied patients with brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain is swinging to the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">In order to save life, you have to reduce the pressure of the skull.</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes need to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">Instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist to analyze the brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">Letting cells grow from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families.</seg>
<seg id="822">You have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive.</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts, Jean-François was able to do so.</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw this under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">It looked exactly as a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, mature cells.</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells that can transform themselves into every cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">The adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden deep, small niches of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die, they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks, they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">We saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the foetus stage, they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they kept?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">We believe that they are involved in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injuries in higher concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">One thing is clear however -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass out of the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the final step we re-planted them at the removal point of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplant -- autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-implant these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-plan the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">In the first scenario we imported the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the room is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear.</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury and re-imported exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew up to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">The evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we dyed in vitro, in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">Of course we could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained Monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets of a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">When they reached a stable skill level, we injured the motor skills area in the motoric cortex.</seg>
<seg id="869">Then the monkeys were paralyzed, they couldn't move their hand anymore.</seg>
<seg id="870">Just as it would happen in humans, they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree, just as after a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with the monkey.</seg>
<seg id="872">When we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted his own cells.</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you see the monkey, who recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">Now see when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the rice plantation.</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">We can use it in other neuropathological models such as Parkinson's disease.</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to imitate her in man.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"" "Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" "" "I know someone who can do it." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely do.</seg>
<seg id="886">Of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can begin clinical trials on humans.</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results one needs about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate and so on.</seg>
<seg id="889">JB: yeah, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team.</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical trials. if you continue looking into the future, how many years it takes for someone to come to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">First, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority permit us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then this study must be carried out with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">After that, you have to apply this to a multicentre study.</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne, thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">We do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality but as an inventory of our society.</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable gedness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">In fact, democracy wanes with us, in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- it was unequivocally clear to me as finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- could not affect the austerity programs implemented in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">At that moment, I thought there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished when it would change anything.</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce you an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup succumb to a misbelief, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a truthful and defenseless democracy.</seg>
<seg id="913">Without democracy our societies are blamed, our future bleak and our great, new technologies are wasted.</seg>
<seg id="914">On the subject of waste I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction that currently threatens our economies.</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">A summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which casts his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world.</seg>
<seg id="917">We all know the mountain of debt,</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">A mountain of untapped cash, which belongs to the wealthy savers and corporations, which are too fearful to invest there where it would be productive and income which could produce the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example green energy.</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">Over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars have been invested in the U.S., England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on.</seg>
<seg id="922">3,4 trillion US dollar accounts for a lot of money, until one compares it to the $5.1 trillion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing except to inflate stock exchanges and to promote real estate prices.</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks that are not offset by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">The result is staggering wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, as in an endless loop, reinforces the pessimism of investors, who, by fear, the prophecy of the rocket could be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,</seg>
<seg id="925">Involuntarily, the circumstances cause the body to kill it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to further develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies, "green" technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth.</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society in which the free and the poor as majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The athenical democracy naturally closed too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">Women, foreigners, and of course slaves.</seg>
<seg id="933">"" "" "" "however, it would be a mistake to mitigate the importance of athenical democracy due to these exclusions." ""</seg>
<seg id="934">The decisive thing about the athenish democracy was and is that she kept the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, giving them the right to political co-determination with equal voting rights in questions of state interests.</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">Like a candle that shines brightly, it is quickly burned out.</seg>
<seg id="937">However, our current liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,</seg>
<seg id="938">But in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="939">While the athenical democracy concentrated on the free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for rulers.</seg>
<seg id="940">For the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was implanted on politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="941">In our current democracies there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, as the economy gradually emigrated and deprived them of politics.</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power because the power is diverted from politics into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my sharks with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">If you think about it, it is like a herd of predators that sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds on, that at the end it starves.</seg>
<seg id="947">It is similar to the economy that has channeled politics so far that it harms itself through the self-created economic crisis. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, the inequality falling, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managers of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies.</seg>
<seg id="948">The more successful capitalism drives the "demos" out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the well-being of humanity.</seg>
<seg id="949">If this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the "demos" keep control, as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="950">By the way, this is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go out very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new species of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">The problem is, as long as economics and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks grow higher, the waste of sublime, and social conflicts lower, as I believe -- very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China.</seg>
<seg id="956">So we have to redesign the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified field, otherwise we end up in a pathological monitoring hyper that makes the film "Matrix" a documentary.</seg>
<seg id="957">The question is not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it has produced --</seg>
<seg id="958">The more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the "matrix," or by something similar to the society in "Star Trek," in which machines serve humans and humans invest their energy into the exploration of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenian "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life.</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it look like to have this "Star Trek "-like utopia rather than the" Matrix "-like dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="961">In practical implementation I would like to give you, in brief, some examples.</seg>
<seg id="962">In the field of companies, please introduce a capital market where money is earned while working and in which your capital flows from one place to another, from one company to another, and the company -- no matter in which one currently works -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company.</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all revenues from capital and revenues originate and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="964">No distinction between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees working there, but which the company does not belong. no more exchange between capital and labour, no large gaps between investment and saving, and ultimately no lifting twin peaks.</seg>
<seg id="965">In the field of global political economy, please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity.</seg>
<seg id="966">Imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it "the cosmos," in units of "cosmos" -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a mutual fund.</seg>
<seg id="967">"" "imagine that this fund is investing in" "" "green" "" "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rare." ""</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">Today we have them, in particular against the background of a reunified policy and economy.</seg>
<seg id="972">The world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which they preferred privileged people, and Marxist because they will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, globally Keynesian.</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will awaken in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">"" "or are we going to sink into a" "" "matrix" "" "- similar dystopia?" ""</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands, and we do it better democratically.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">In your biography you describe yourself as a liberal Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">The reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive drop in overall economic demand, which termed Larry Summers as "long term stagnation."</seg>
<seg id="984">By transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low.</seg>
<seg id="985">If this analysis is true, Marx is quite relevant,</seg>
<seg id="986">Just like Hayek, that's why I am a liberal Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am totally swirling.</seg>
<seg id="987">BG: in fact, and now we are.</seg>
<seg id="988">YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough.</seg>
<seg id="989">BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the orators you have said very clearly what you think from the West's point of view in China.</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">As I said in my speech, we have limited the democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays out -- the sphere of economy -- is a completely democratic-free zone.</seg>
<seg id="994">In a certain sense, if I may say so provocative, China is today similar to the England of the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="995">For -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is a mistake, historically regarded.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill,</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">What we can see now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second.</seg>
<seg id="999">Now proposing China to do what the West has done in the 19th century smells of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as finance ministers of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that's coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1005">Not only Greece, but the Eurozone,</seg>
<seg id="1006">"" "" "" "to say good-bye to ourselves and the long-lasting denial that a massive throw-away line went through the eurozone, and continues to be massively threatened by the development of the whole European Union." ""</seg>
<seg id="1007">We had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --</seg>
<seg id="1008">"" "" "" "unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, have continued to choose the denial." ""</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">If you try to get an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism in life, you may be able to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive.</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Ernsthaft...</seg>
<seg id="1017">If there is a minister of finance, or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then that is a dangerous person.</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that didn't exist.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they didn't want to deal with the distortions running through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that for 5 years they had passed through a catastrophic program in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">It is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">"" "none of the troika who imposed on us this policy was:" "" "this was a colossal mistake." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1027">BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive tone of talks, you seem to be still pro-European.</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "" "" "my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="1030">"" "" "" "my biggest fear is that the eurozone does not survive." ""</seg>
<seg id="1031">For if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will demonic and destroy the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This will not be disastrous for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy.</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">If we allow ourselves to propose the path of a post-modern 1930, what appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans and non-Europeans.</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're wrong at this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">Yanis, thank you for being at TED.</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">Von Roy Price has never heard the majority, although it is probably responsible for 22 mediocre minutes of your life on April 19, 2013.</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a leading employee at Amazon Studios,</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"" "he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelhairstyle and describes himself on Twitter as" "" "Films, TV, Technique, Tacos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">Of course, this is a very hard-fought industry.</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">He has to find shows which are very, very good.</seg>
<seg id="1048">In other words, he has to find shows that are on the right of this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the level shows how many shows receive this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">If your show is valued at nine and higher, this will be a winner.</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">These are shows like Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where after watching a relay, your brain asks:" where is there any more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">On the left, here at this end, shows like "Toddlers and Tiaras" -- -- this should tell you enough what goes on at this end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about getting on the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to prohibit "toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">He makes more thoughts about the mean output, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire.</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">The pressure is present and of course it is also the first time that Amazon does something, so Roy Price does not want to risk anything.</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">He needs guaranteed success, so he considers a competition.</seg>
<seg id="1061">He takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch them for free.</seg>
<seg id="1062">And if Amazon comes out for nothing, how do you pick it up, right?</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of viewers are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">However, they do not know they are being watched while watching these shows.</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">You record when you start the show when you pause, which parts you jump over or watch again.</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to then decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"" "in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" "" "Amazon should make a sitcom over four Republican US Senators." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1069">They did this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">Yes, "Alpha House," but it seems that not many can remember this show because it was not so good.</seg>
<seg id="1072">It's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- a bit above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked.</seg>
<seg id="1073">Approximately at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find them a super show and he also uses data for it, but it makes it a bit different.</seg>
<seg id="1074">Instead of organizing a competition, he and his team have watched the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the reviews they give the shows their course of which shows they like etc.</seg>
<seg id="1075">Then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors.</seg>
<seg id="1076">When they had all the parts together they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but rather a drama series about a Senator.</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">Yes, "House of Cards." Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons.</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">Of course, the question is: what has happened here?</seg>
<seg id="1081">One has two very competitive, data sealed companies.</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">If you collect millions of data for a decision you encounter, you should make a good decision.</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It optimizes it through very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">The least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="1089">If data analysis does not work this way, this is somewhat frightening because we live in a time when we use more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television.</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">No one. OK, that's even good.</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">If someone is in prison here in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not.</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">Moderate television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse.</seg>
<seg id="1096">Unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are produced. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">Yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1100">In 2009, Google announced that through data analysis breaks of flu, the bad way, they can predict -- through data analysis of Google searches.</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">It worked flawlessly, year by year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">It simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">Despite all these errors, data flows into decisions of life - at the workplace, in the law enforcement, in medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-based genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use inconceivably many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medicine. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">If you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:</seg>
<seg id="1111">First you disassemble this problem in its components so that you can analyze the components; as a second, you put the items together again to make a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">Data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to dismantle a problem and understand its parts.</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">If there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it's the brain of an expert.</seg>
<seg id="1118">That's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and understanding, where they also belong in the process.</seg>
<seg id="1119">They use data to better understand their audience what they otherwise would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all these parts back together and make a show like "House of Cards" does not stand in the data.</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show, which meant that they had a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">They used data to control all their decisions, first as they compete for TV ideas, then when they chose "alpha House" as a show.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"" "it was a safe decision because they could always say:" "" "they tell us the data." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Data are helpful for better decisions but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1126">No matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful.</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">Before there was any data, this was the device for decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"" "it is also called" "" "Magic 8 Ball" "". "it's amazing. for decisions using a ja- or no-issue you just have to shake the ball to get an answer." "" "most likely" "" "-- right here at this moment." ""</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in retrospect.</seg>
<seg id="1133">But, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them with something much more sophisticated than data analysis to make better decisions.</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not alter the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">So maybe the ball will be smarter and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner.</seg>
<seg id="1136">And I feel this is very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it still pays to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing, and taking risks.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve.</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
