Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt , where young people should meet today .
a chapel that is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers cultivate the ru@@ sty ground of peasants .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everyone knows this , who already had to be upset because the Auto @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
the historical maps of the digital Bayern At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but especially very informative .
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur .
the digital Bayern Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ ering carpet that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
for cities and communities more detailed maps , so @-@ called original position sheets , were incorporated into the large overview map .
these were created according to the Bavarian surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and arose from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
the French army captain occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
even if the French troops finally with@@ drew the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map .
Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian surve@@ ying management .
the original position sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of the former / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
Send@@ ling was registered 21 years after the map was created , i.e. 18@@ 77 , in the district of Munich .
today Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city .
the houses Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings concentrate around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser until 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 .
where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; original &quot; from which the base tax was derived .
today , small plots show no more farmers - but farmers of the plant &quot; Land in the Sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert .
on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the area of the present district au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Auf der Lü@@ ften &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions .
it was there in 18@@ 58 / 59 that the Munich district Ir@@ ren@@ amt &quot; Auf der Au@@ er Lü@@ ften &quot; was created .
from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the establishment - that psychiat@@ rist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the appeal of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Irish &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen Museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution .
there was first room for 280 patients , later it was extended to 500 places .
at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar in 1905 .
since 2006 there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ikum in Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts .
young people in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um are now meeting in the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments .
West lies the football pitch of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential houses from the 1980s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2015 , the children &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural style based on the original construction of the Ir@@ ren@@ amt , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was named &quot; Main Square &quot; around 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger Street was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies torn many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at Mari@@ en@@ hof .
the English institute , small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are the prepar@@ atory work and on 5 April 2017 the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second subur@@ ban railway line will take place .
with the sli@@ der the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
civil Rights Group publishes warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for the Promotion of Far@@ es has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discri@@ min@@ atory policy and ra@@ cial attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , invites af@@ ro @-@ amer@@ ican travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i to take special attention when travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , ra@@ cial incidents occur in recent times throughout the state . &quot;
a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination , as well as the enforcement agencies of the state , which dispro@@ portion@@ ately focus on minorities , prompted the group to release the warning message , the NA@@ AC@@ P said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have violations of civil rights that happen to people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , K@@ ans@@ as City Star .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency which we have not yet heard . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
the group quoted incidents like rac@@ ist violation of black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from T@@ enn@@ es@@ see .
S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was taken custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of being guilty .
the Council also refers to a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i , a recent report by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which shows that black mot@@ ori@@ sts in the state will be raised 75 percent more frequently than white .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people must be willing to bring their deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting program of the FB@@ I , which classi@@ fies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination .
prior to that , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona since the states adopted immigration laws that obli@@ ge local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further ra@@ cial benefit .
warning warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but l@@ ately interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States .
crossover project is elementary
the Wei@@ dez@@ au@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the members of the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Assembly Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have got a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the right @-@ gra@@ ving court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his operations , in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many k@@ itt@@ ens provided and accommod@@ ated in five apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schwar@@ zw@@ al@@ d@@ milch &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este only Regi@@ on@@ ales .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since he is also B@@ L@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the soft @-@ down project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; elementary important . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit in such steep areas .
the green area care for a lot of work , a lot must be dealt with with the brus@@ h@@ cutter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography to fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emphasized Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead bio @-@ operation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader support . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .
I hope that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the surfaces could be dra@@ fted for quite a while .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion
a total of 25 plots were en@@ capsul@@ ated by eleven participants in 2013 .
the open maintenance area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be aff@@ or@@ ested to at least 20@@ 23 .
of the total costs of 71 500 euros , half was promoted via leader , a quarter carried the municipality of Fisch@@ bach .
thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of electric fence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and coun@@ try@@ women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also for Peter Weiß asser@@ ted : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regional Direc@@ tion Directive ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg makes it possible to promote the state advancement of wheat @-@ lag@@ o@@ ons .
the goal is the sec@@ rec@@ y of the Black Forest .
the prerequisite is the presence of a transfer rate marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the fenced area must not be economically viable ( slope of over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the proposal of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the Wei@@ dez@@ h@@ ort project 2018 .
the open maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 1@@ 12@@ ,000 euros .
is nothing holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump Regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CN@@ N on the proposals of the president to restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty .
to stay fair , Miller didn &apos;t handle the statue himself .
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty im@@ it@@ ators would have yn@@ ted him if he had done it .
but he picked up its significance , and in particular the importance which it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when Miller proclaimed A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the poem on which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller is fac@@ tually correct , but as he formulated it himself , it &apos;s not really about history .
it is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your id@@ l@@ eness , your poor , / your oppressed masses , who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the el@@ event@@ h apost@@ asy of your rich coasts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a time when the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; el@@ event@@ h waste &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on our screens was better visible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a high political action .
the sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republi@@ can@@ ism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant femin@@ ist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .
the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not inv@@ ade anyone , but rather an early ne@@ o@@ conservative that puts the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty is moving forward .
she is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the torch is not supposed to illumin@@ ate the way to the United States . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lim@@ bau@@ gh has encountered something quite unusual here .
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the viewpoint of perception .
the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was to see her as seen by the exhausted , el@@ emental , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships .
it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .
their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
and this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump would ever want to acknowledge .
her torch is not to illumin@@ ate the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is its only source of power .
world Championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , states that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship header &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; something special develops in Scotland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I speak with people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type at the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ ovo , who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m line while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is elected team captain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is quite modest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black .
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h brought back naturally were great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al winner , who will compete for the 400 m hur@@ dles in their fifth world championships , says it &apos;s &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Scot@@ ts are in the British squ@@ ad .
Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 .
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records .
it will take part in the 1500 m and the 5.000 m of runs .
Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ s@@ man , which one should observe after a great season which included the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games .
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships as the only other Scot@@ s@@ man in Team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
the team captain says that they are &quot; hu@@ gely proud &quot; of the fact that many of their fellow coun@@ try@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases also participate in the med@@ als and the fin@@ als .
&quot; being so special about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honor anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me , makes it something special for me , &quot; she added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it shows only how far we have come .
and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb to po@@ di@@ ums .
as to my speech as captain ?
yes , I think she went well .
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
block Cri@@ tics on Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the local voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers hit him for everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .
he dab@@ bled in criticism , certainly .
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more than Washington .
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union lam@@ ented him at the beginning of this week .
the governor &apos;s staff dis@@ missed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; said many people .
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hair loose head after chemotherapy on his side .
hence the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily and ultimately dangerous .
in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokesperson A@@ mel@@ ia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation .
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who swing the whi@@ p online .
the mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
and these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur , and a priest , no troll@@ s .
they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gans Catholic faith .
lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful but she asked for hate crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I commented cour@@ te@@ ously that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are rather dis@@ regarded by some rather than a so called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; what the governor &apos;s employees referred to as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or del@@ eting a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in earlier times when one has done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical cor@@ p@@ ses and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators .
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this issue fell in Virginia last week .
the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County shed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Jud@@ ge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when she banned a vot@@ er from her Facebook page .
and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .
that shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
at the time of Washington , the time of affordable porting had a similar effect as the Internet .
the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat on his lead .
and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
the people who used pseud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions .
peti@@ tions which critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and shipping with Great Britain were overwhel@@ med by the historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project .
but he did not silence her .
freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation .
and true guidance means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts at the Renaissance Club
the former Europeans no . 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lo@@ thi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .
the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led up to the final round in the Arch@@ er@@ field last year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ vad@@ i .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his glory with this event , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great state . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he laid hold of that place .
he is a keen advoc@@ ate of this game and is proud of his achievement here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Engli@@ sh@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it really feels special , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open since it was taken from the program in the year after I had won it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
the memories of the past year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year .
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure .
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid Golf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad to see how it has gone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

less lung cancer due to passive smoking
in the past two decades fewer and fewer people died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .
scientists at the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are attributed to passive smoking each year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Doctor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject from 1994 .
back then there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house Connec@@ tions prove to be very complex
&quot; &quot; &quot; the construction works in Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lie reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the head of the building station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the area of the house connections , the location is more complicated than assumed , since underground is a lot of mountains , which is not mentioned in the plans .
traffic , which continually obstruc@@ ts the construction work , represents a major problem for the construction of the company St@@ ump@@ p .
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ ori@@ sts in front of red lights and shut @-@ off lock@@ ers is enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze .
the road is closed and only the regular buses are allowed to pass through .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z and Tim Kost@@ or@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks .
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
but luckily we were fed by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Kost@@ or@@ z .
poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country
when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove .
it even rarely uses a pot .
in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai reg@@ ent@@ ship in the un@@ ser@@ ene Indonesian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace .
after half an hour the stolen tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands .
De@@ ge@@ i sits on the ground floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp .
a bucket in a hom@@ eless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
as the youngest of her husband &apos;s four wives , her no fields were assigned .
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
of course late to work can be dangerous : most vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are the soldiers here .
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says .
it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occup@@ ying forces .
an existing movement , stir@@ red up for independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers .
in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea encomp@@ assed the eastern part of the island .
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and of corrugated iron roofs , which were converted into various yellow @-@ brown tones by rust .
only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .
before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago learnt Pap@@ u@@ ans a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee .
there were also other changes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her bright coat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Papua is the poor@@ est province of Indonesia , where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also the Indonesian gold country .
the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3.000 inhabitants .
in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced its worth of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .
in addition , Papua has wooden resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars .
these assets , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military maintains a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence .
an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 15@@ 0,000 in a single officer .
Pap@@ u@@ anic demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tor@@ tured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s were charged in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission for Gen@@ o@@ cide .
in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Will P@@ ut Every@@ thing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , which reports about atro@@ cities of the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric failures are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bolts have increased because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demographic development changes because Muslim economic migrants are coming from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i .
Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado @-@ g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served .
local people fight to stay here .
&quot; migrants began to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai Local who moved to the provincial capital Jay@@ ap@@ ura .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Indonesian President J@@ oko Wi@@ do@@ do , pop@@ ularly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua during his election campaign in 2014 .
the former carp@@ enter captured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua , including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ov@@ i with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says You . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ov@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October .
on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness .
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn on their head@@ lights .
one of the soldiers ki@@ cked off their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Y@@ av@@ edt T@@ eb@@ ai .
the soldiers who d@@ rank and beat the group with their guns , told victims and witnesses .
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma .
a few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the Military Command Centre to demand justice .
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bu@@ ds and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - running in the circle and im@@ i@@ ding a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started to cast stones on police and military posts .
when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media .
Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto quarter of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .
nobody was able to listen in the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house .
Kay@@ am still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he added .
the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , who witnessed the shooting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only bears a name like many Indones@@ ians , the TI@@ ME in a dark atmosphere . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je M@@ ende , said repor@@ ters that his officers wanted to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their station because they are being attacked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many more injured .
the news about the kill@@ ings came to Jak@@ arta until the next day .
for three weeks , Jok@@ ov@@ i in Jay@@ ap@@ ura held a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Security Minister Wir@@ anto in October 2016 that he will set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the settlement of historical human rights violations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most injuries have occurred long ago . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some were in the 90 @-@ s and early 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that need to be tra@@ vers@@ ed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said that he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; &quot; &quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Wir@@ anto , which the UN has accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ ors of bloody independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been included , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot; &quot; &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims embra@@ ced such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ m in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the past three years , but there has been no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes .
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the bodies , the military sought me , &quot; he says .
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
on Tuesday the Indonesian police fired on vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai .
during a confrontation between vill@@ agers and the manager of a construction company , who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .
the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .
excited vill@@ agers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s site .
the police said that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who responded by firing the warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that it will give revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME .
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon the officers to take account of the officers and withdraw the police force from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an un@@ rest for the Indonesian government .
the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the tribal members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua .
many joined the &quot; Free State Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by shooting spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kid@@ n@@ apping of Indonesian soldiers .
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including T@@ adi@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily arrested in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot;
some never appear again .
among people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
the little rice sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just out of reach .
the people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
in the course of time economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nab@@ ire airport .
the few jobs there are in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says John Go@@ bai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribal council . &quot; &quot; &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Papua .
in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se .
at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua related institutions due to lack of coordination , although they gave them the rare permission to film .
according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ov &apos;s election campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Papua and West pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lack of media control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government largely remains confined to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
in March , six paci@@ fic states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting .
the same countries have historically supported O@@ PM .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ tha N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the alleg@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited Jay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , locals broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous .
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the people say that they will probably not vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again .
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Go@@ bai , Chairman of the Board of Directors .
he wants the Pan@@ i@@ ai people to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a pre@@ dat@@ ory military , is located in poor educational and health services .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Go@@ bai states that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; which he has to pay back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says .
despite the threats and in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai sho@@ ot@@ ers led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the body of a victim was buried on a site just across the police and the military station .
they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with a lowered head . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire records the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building .
it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the sky@@ scra@@ per in only two years , which is inci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) .
the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and when the people scre@@ amed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters .
Du@@ ba@@ is civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units ki@@ cked off the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .@@ 00 GMT ) and ch@@ illed the building .
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in external areas of sky@@ scra@@ pers all over the world .
an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after the fire in 2015 found that the largest part of the damage came from the cl@@ adding , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation .
in Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding on the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .
no Davis Cup reform : continue Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) has been thr@@ illed with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the Annual General Meeting .
at the session in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the proposal for this sport was to play Davis Cup single only on two winning rates , thin@@ ly not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority .
the often very long , but therefore also very este@@ emed Five @-@ Set @-@ classics remain the traditional competi@@ tor so .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the aim of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only scar@@ cely missed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historic competitions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
not until the vote , after many in@@ consi@@ sten@@ cies , the proposal had already come to ex@@ or@@ cise the final in a neutral place .
new from 2018 are comparatively minor details : in the next round , the fin@@ alists will have the right to host the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in the next round .
in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less official media schedules before the Davis Cup .
more than 1 out of 5 U.S. Trav@@ eller brings forbidden objects to the plane , finds a survey
a survey among flight pass@@ angers revealed that more than 20 percent deliberately or un@@ intentionally prohibited items were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled at the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent that entered the aircraft , while acci@@ dentally wearing banned knife or other objects with blades .
less than 1 percent claimed that they were bel@@ at@@ edly discovered that they had been mistaken for fire@@ arms , amm@@ unition or explo@@ sives .
the survey of more than 1,000 people - the one of a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , was conducted - also noted that younger travelers rather dis@@ regard the rules .
of the respon@@ dents admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 percent of m@@ illenni@@ als were compared to less than 15 percent , who were members of Generation X .
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
more than 3 per cent reported to have know@@ ingly carried items with blades through security control , while 2.2 percent of female inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male inter@@ vie@@ we@@ es also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft .
the company said it was asking travelers all over the country to find out how many acci@@ dentally had s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled goods by airport security and how many had deliberately done it .
it is no surprise that the people who are most likely s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry on security , those who fly most often .
the company however points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using .
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids used by the T@@ SA are prohibited fluids .
for a while the people thought T@@ SA could look at books as s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling goods .
liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights .
El@@ on Mus@@ k it doesn &apos;t matter : cancel tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers order
electro @-@ Taus@@ end@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k likes to give up with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
in doing so , he has so far under@@ lined that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its non @-@ binding reservation .
in addition to the increasingly trium@@ ph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la chief El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed a different , less glorious number when the recent quarter@@ ly balance has been announced : the cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 .
in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had adverti@@ sed more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .
now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders .
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the United States 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 Po@@ unds ) &quot; reservation payment . &quot;
at present 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations are available , in a telephone conference with analysts .
however , the Tes@@ la chief does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .
his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side .
last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles .
in 2018 , all models will be taken together - $ 500@@ ,000 , a million by 2020 .
the demand for this is obviously there .
according to Mus@@ k there are 1800 reservations per day .
anyone who orders a Model 3 today may anticip@@ ate delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new , never @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization in practice .
many experts doubt that this is possible .

EPA chief P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the lack of rules of the Obama Er@@ a to reduce emissions
one day after he was accused of 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , resig@@ ned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing pollutants .
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of App@@ eal .
it is a deadline that went on 1 October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for down @-@ to @-@ earth o@@ zone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance for one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; interfere in local decisions or im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump prosec@@ utor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations for a long time .
since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulation , which resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
last month , a Federal Court of App@@ eal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age .
in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often not adher@@ ed to dead@@ lines for performing and then waiting to be accused of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EP@@ O more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us serious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EP@@ O said that P@@ ru@@ itt would eventually use his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; authority to delay and all other legally @-@ available powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are based on solid policy and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ cans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive acquisition of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet set up in the Senate .
the New York General Prosecutor , Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition of States who filed the EP@@ O this week , said the Group intends to maintain the legal pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the conversion of EPA - according to our complaints - is an important asset for health and security of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g who flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new York merged in this case California , Connec@@ tic@@ ut , Del@@ aware , Illinois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oregon , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia .
soil oz@@ on occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refin@@ eries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .
the emerging smoke can cause serious breathing problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year to thousands of premature deaths contribute .
representatives of public health and environ@@ ment@@ alists che@@ ered over P@@ ru@@ denti@@ al surprising course changes .
&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , &quot; said Lor@@ i An@@ n Bur@@ d from the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue fighting against the ideological crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to address environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tum@@ arc Celeb@@ rates 750 Years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church
750 years of St. Hil@@ arius &apos; Church : on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ gen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , July 16 , at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay .
visitors to the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens their concern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a unique village jewel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 12@@ 67 St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle ( St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle ) was first mentioned in the Württemberg urn book : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ arc including the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .
according to the wording of the certificate , apart from the former parish church , there was also a magnificent courtyard where the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged to and not vice versa .
there were also people there .
as seen from the description of the municipality of Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , next to the village and the upper village , which are still visible in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ bling , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the most magnificent settlement centre of the village .
old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical conditions .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age originated from the early medieval self @-@ church law .
a master who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit the church .
thus , the right to use a pastor or propose a new pastor to the bishop .
there were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ ens of the two crum@@ ble at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942 .
in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was leak@@ y .
17@@ 96 French troops en@@ camped near the church .
they broke out the pul@@ pit and the church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ gen Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the final resting place for the Dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demoli@@ shed .
only the church tower was left .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve 18@@ 34 , a storm split the steep@@ le and half fell .
to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demoli@@ shed .
only the still existing tower was preserved as a witness to the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; today Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter W@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius plant from the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schaff@@ haus@@ Rent@@ meister &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as success@@ ors of Dieter D@@ ock@@ horn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as organizers invite friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle .
it is designed by the com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words from Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Mr. Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 .
to the end of the seren@@ ade , a trunk is held in front of the cemetery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the organis@@ ers face the fantastic view . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the seren@@ ade is held only in dry weather .
the organis@@ ers hope to receive many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius institution , which is of great importance for tum@@ ours and audi@@ tors .
friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to home care , as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to allow permission of wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim twe@@ aks itself &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; does not see a legal pre@@ condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; association has called upon Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is illegal .
the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind power concentration zone .
within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .
&quot; &quot; &quot; such zones should prevent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; savings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the city of Vier@@ sen had already decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette a few days before - but this had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government , because of a mal@@ formation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be withdrawn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , chairman of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim we@@ ars himself . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council again resolved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; a permit from the district government still stands out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in this place , the granting of permission for the establishment of wind turbines is ruled out legally . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the request .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the relevant writings have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained a spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the circle takes them to the occasion to check the matter again .
they probably do not expect the procedure to be stopped .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself to the argument of the association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans the construction of four wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
last year , the company , in which the town of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has closed lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land .
with the construction of four wind turbines , the electricity needs of some 11 400 households should be covered - this is equivalent to about one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households .
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Wind@@ park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district .
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident occurred on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was injured in killing .
two other people were slightly injured .
the state road remained closed for hours .
according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch accompanied her car with her 53 year old mother as accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel .
city and dealer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ ei@@ a and people from the region are to discover shopping in the city center in September .
the business association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city centre .
as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend aims to sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods .
according to this , a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market .
in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training places .
in addition , the shops of the city center will invite to &quot; midnight shopping . &quot;
the action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the nearby region .
in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König .
city administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
this means that the trade association and the city go into a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive City Centre . &quot;
these include new promotions , such as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; for well @-@ selling Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts in order to move them to active participation .
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
in addition , customer potentials should be new or re @-@ developed .
these include spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city center when shopping .
in the end , everyone would have to contribute to the li@@ fes@@ pan of the city - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and associations .
it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly spread , had the king said in the spring .
Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; day in Germany will take part in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time .
next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advertise for the appreciation of local trade and bring its importance to the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of Commerce of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour as a direct environment .

Tr@@ ump put pressure on the payment of the boundary wall after tran@@ scri@@ bed tran@@ scripts from telephone calls Mexico
tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
on 27 January , Tr@@ ump requested a phone call with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the US President le@@ aked him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project .
tran@@ scrip@@ tions of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr Turn@@ bull that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Obama administration , would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he had proposed a ban on res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US .
Mr. Tr@@ ump finished the call after having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford Mass@@ ac@@ re : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ Act as a call for justice
a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of viewers in the Mon@@ roe countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Mo@@ ore .
before the car , which had four black passengers and a white rider , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block his path .
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a needle @-@ stri@@ pe @-@ suit - took a long train on his c@@ ig@@ ar and looked at the wind@@ shield .
inside , the in@@ mates flo@@ ated in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged down by the passenger seat .
fortunately , this horri@@ ble scene , played on July 22nd , is only a night@@ mare .
but when a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all of them hit very real sigh@@ s in the audience .
since 2005 , civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com and George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were retri@@ eved by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one was ever charged with murder .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches even though we know who they are , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps organizing the post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old con@@ gres@@ s@@ man of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
for him , the post @-@ ordination serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ roe community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a court physician lays a sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ne on July 27 , 1946 .
according to FB@@ I files obtained from N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ roe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ching process .
but none of them was ever charged .
although the suspect has been on the loose for decades , civil rights advoc@@ ates say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .
in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court rendered the black citizens in Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .
approximately at the same time as the choice stab@@ bed according to the FB@@ I of the black color guard Roger Mal@@ com a white landlord , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , like the FB@@ I .
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ousin Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes an FB@@ I report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between state and local prosecution that was not only involved in kill@@ ings , eradi@@ cate evidence and fal@@ si@@ fied the identity of witnesses . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a fran@@ chise massacre , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
their representation is clear , gri@@ pping and is well @-@ founded in a kind of deep ra@@ cism , many of whom would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .
it &apos;s hard to watch and look even more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot;
the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest Black - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene had launched a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece .
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a Gre@@ ene co @-@ director here .
he has played the role of the chief @-@ clan member for years , but he said the role will never be easier .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to those times . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the other side of the room , actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sh@@ aw and Nick Ras@@ cona tried to play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines .
the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the ne@@ sts scre@@ ams and pus@@ hes him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He win@@ ches my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he respon@@ ds to the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona .
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just don &apos;t think that white people back then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; --@@ --- he &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yet , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of the other black performers thunder@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; R. &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ ion@@ ship replaces the discomfort .
everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people .
the scene starts again .
this time , when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with im@@ print .
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman , dressed with a gri@@ eving dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks with every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down just down the street .
they experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as de@@ pressing moisture for nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads her on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
up to this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y .
when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies .
children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the quiet body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little boy mur@@ m@@ urs as if he wanted to remember . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after a few minutes gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch@@ rope and wipe off their tears .
Brad@@ sh@@ aw embra@@ ces Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .
Nick Ras@@ chio embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , and the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of the women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that this is not in your heart . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you have done this for one reason . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
later the audience joins together with the actors for dinner .
at a table , a white pair of Atlanta talks about the Nach@@ stellung with a black pair , which they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words , which feeling the performance left .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching still goes on , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the same room Ty@@ rone keeps Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he e@@ ats and rec@@ alls the civil rights .
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a way , because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s like we don &apos;t learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ ämmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf presents a colourful fri@@ vol@@ ous performance in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story backdrop .
the stage ( designed by Alek@@ sand@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a fo@@ amed street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and E@@ la@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
before that , an open Mercedes classic car park , in which the Rhein@@ kill@@ ers pose as rock erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively a Is@@ etta .
stack@@ ed oil barrels remember Cast@@ or@@ fs Leit@@ mo@@ tiv - money , power and gre@@ ed - which runs through his &quot; ring &quot; production .
the three Rhein@@ kill@@ ers - sung by Stephan@@ ie Hou@@ tz@@ eel , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot;
they seduc@@ ed Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , gr@@ ind a cor@@ p@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que .
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ er .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later also Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) has to believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .
Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te , are celebrated stor@@ my .
there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the large heat back in casual casual wear .
the show was eag@@ erly awa@@ ited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of staff .
in 2013 , in 2013 , he had to give a g@@ lowing pipe concert about himself , there were five years later a great jubil@@ ation in which the occasional &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down .
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have enjoyed this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; grew together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its view .
I draw a positive ré@@ sum@@ é .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where everywhere ?
quantity : usually in stone belts at the furniture fair , once a week I will help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge .
and I also worked at school in an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
quantity : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here .
I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults .
they are now 26 years , so a later @-@ called volunteer .
how does it come about ?
amount : I graduated from high school .
and then a civil engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off .
I realized for myself that it &apos;s the wrong thing and I want to do something different , work with people .
and then I asked what are you doing .
make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it really is on site , at the focal point .
and was it like that ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester .
I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker education and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences .
isn &apos;t it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
quantity : yes , it is very variable .
it always depends on where you are going to be FS@@ J .
it is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
with me it was very varied .
I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care .
for me it was just the right thing that irrit@@ ated me .
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
in a different way than in civil engineering ?
amount : well , here it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics .
one repeat@@ ed@@ ely has other people in front of the head , each having a completely different story behind him .
whether a refugee , whether a young man , who has been taken out of the family - must always deal with it individually .
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
amount : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
lots of love , lots of kindness .
there are also negative moments , but life is so .
Pear@@ son k@@ ills more 3,000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will disman@@ tle further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces .
the job cuts , which General Director John Fall@@ on announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019 , comes in addition to its previous restructuring , which has already lost 4,000 points .
in May in a third cost @-@ cutting programme , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business which was hit by the fast pace of digital learning .
the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the Ber@@ tel@@ smann partner last month , said the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year .
con@@ vo@@ y attack of Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in suicide bom@@ bing
a suicide bom@@ ber has attacked a military con@@ vo@@ y in the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , killed NATO and injured several others , say officials .
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured , shared an explanation by NATO .
according to local reports , three civilians died in the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district .
the bom@@ bing is the last violent act that Afghanistan met this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a statement by NATO , it is said that the explosion on Thursday evening had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive set &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured are in a stable state and are treated in the US military hospital on the air@@ field of B@@ agra@@ m .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Tali@@ ban and the group known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby area .
according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital .
at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ bing killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul .
the Tali@@ ban said they had carried out this attack .
on 31 May , a massive bom@@ bing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops forced the Tali@@ ban from power in 2001 .
violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump balances the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country .
correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul in recent weeks have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and especially in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani .
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Decision to Del@@ ay the Smo@@ g Rule according to K@@ lagen@@ um
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , repe@@ aled that the states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place a day after 15 states def@@ end@@ ent the agency because of the step .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EP@@ O announced a decision late on Wednesday to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ Rules 2015 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and said it is showing the agency &apos;s commitment to work with States . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe in dialogue and that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said EPA chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June the intention of the EPA to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in a part of the country pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured to determine where cuts need to be made to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 .
a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the Colombia district , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .
the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to rec@@ laim a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tr@@ ump to boost economic growth .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ backs of the Democrats and the conservation groups concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EPA &apos;s website says that inhal@@ ing air containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; such as asthma . &quot; &quot; &quot;
community council wants community room
in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ner decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home .
before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property is signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden .
it will continue until the area belonging to the church community is still in the community , but there is now no planning obstacle for the project to be st@@ em@@ med by a private investor .
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
on the ground floor he would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with an area of 70 square meters for a special price .
the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council are facing such a common room not as a meeting place for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean living , but openly into the congregation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget is determined by funding opportunities already last autumn . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the building is in the area of refur@@ bish@@ ment .
the establishment of a common room would be , thus reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent con@@ duci@@ ve .
the proposal fores@@ ees to signal the investor that in this respect no bil@@ lets between the legs are to be cast , the finding that both saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding building - as well as an optional roof - which would reduce the height of the tr@@ ump and make the construction more economical .
need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer believes this addition .
when it helps : unanim@@ ously , he passes the body .
not that easy is the common room .
Daniela &apos;s call points to the many of its own buildings with which you don &apos;t get quite moving forward , for that you rest now at the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger absolutely speaks for the community room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy of wealthy or even foreign investors .
this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface there is no subsi@@ dy , but I get a real counter@@ value , in the case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech .
Sta@@ ig@@ ers &apos;s request to post@@ p@@ one the proposal will find three advoc@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so it remains with two opposing voices at the original program that sum@@ mar@@ ises Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
collision with a car : cycli@@ st is thrown on the road
when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycli@@ st was hit by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured .
as the police told us , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the way to Hil@@ den on the way along the Rad@@ weg path of the Schwar@@ zer road .
the senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the street Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driving in the same direction gave him priority .
when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder drove to the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the opposite traffic .
he met with a car that was a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a return carriage .
FC Bayern München must refuse the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba must play the game against Dortmund .
with personnel worries , FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory play of the new season .
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the staff of the German football record master Bayern München became increasingly bigger at Po@@ kal@@ ei@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
coach Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti does not have to for@@ ego David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing .
for the five defe@@ ats in the past six years , An@@ cel@@ otti has been responsible for the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory play of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday .
hiking in the resin of Star to Star
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the resin the first &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Star@@ way &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is the plans of the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a Plan@@ etary Trail in Göttingen , since 2003 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; accommo@@ dates the information needs of many visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance .
the members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform them about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in@@ quired St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber .
the information on the tablets should be complemented by internet .
therefore a good mobile network reception plays a role in the choice of location .
accessibility is also a criterion .
later , the Star Path train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ base , the viewers experience a lot of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared .
they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star is more light than another , although it is much more distant .
also , in which con@@ stellation you can find a selected star and when it is best to see .
since 2014 , the association operates in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany .
according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the Harz National Park ranks among the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a galax@@ y are clearly visible with naked eye .
since 2003 there has been something similar to the planned star wer@@ g - the Plan@@ etary Trail in the University of Göttingen since 2003 .
starting from Geb@@ hard &apos;s Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of the same ) with the Plan@@ ets Sed@@ na .
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planets - are set up exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
the Earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exact 75 @-@ metre @-@ distant sun at least measures 70 centimet@@ res .
the entire length of the planet route is about four kilometres .
while the light from the sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to .
therefore , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next fixed star however would take half a year .
Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia and V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down
V@@ asy@@ l Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Gar@@ cia , who should stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .
they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ loaded World Box@@ ing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Box@@ ing Organisation super @-@ spring weight champion .
after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision on the former four @-@ divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 pm on ES@@ PN .
when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas said that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am a former fe@@ ather weight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I climbed up for Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to come down on lightweight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
Kli@@ ma asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who will also be interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell after their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans asked him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later expressed herself openly to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said he was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held a generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks that the Tri@@ athlon Champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted the K@@ o @-@ Off . &quot;
Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes .
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the battle that must be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mik@@ ey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great battle . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four wounded to tire bur@@ ners
during an accident on the A@@ 7 , four persons were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market , shortly before the junction of the market .
the car turned to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ took and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe .
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction of the north for about one hour , and the traffic on the left lane could be passed by the accident site .
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the three @-@ chain works better &quot;
Andr@@ e Hoffmann is hoping for the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , that the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e scored points .
with the first game of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , too , would not have been the two oppos@@ ites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to look better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the defender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains , the tr@@ ash can also be optimised further .
and a gate after a free@@ whe@@ eling , the For@@ tun@@ en don &apos;t want to catch any more .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the future , there will be no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experiences in preparation for the three @-@ chain than with the four @-@ chain .
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm funk , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build up well , &quot; said Hoffmann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a prerequisite , but that we do better harmon@@ ise and we don &apos;t afford so much clearance mistakes in the construction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course , Hoffmann also moves to Au@@ e to win the game .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if you can talk about an accident of a failed start , I don &apos;t know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but if we are at four points on Sunday and can focus on the cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about that .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only judged the start into the season after six to eight days of play , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm funk , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be broken off pre@@ mat@@ urely due to a storm . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann that the players from Au@@ e might even be a little fres@@ her since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a promotion favorite in the bones . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but they don &apos;t know 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as a light favourite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that we swe@@ ep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six , is stupid , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance is quite positive in only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga that you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s top coach .
&quot; meeting such a statement would be arro@@ gant and arro@@ gant . &quot;

the latest results of testing for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden who have under@@ gone a new method of medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the people tested are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
they should take a closer look at the assessment of age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish Migration Service ( migration ) has been critic@@ ised for errors in ass@@ essing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .
up to now , Migration verk@@ et has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 tests to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 .
eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion was that the person &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; may be under 18 years of age &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is challenged .
according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent over the past few months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high percentage of cases where the person was judged more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ er has lied about his age .
in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the person studied 18 years or older . &quot;
when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , it found that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had said openly that it would be 18 years old this year .
the method of medical age assessment , for X @-@ ray imaging of wisdom teeth and MRI scans of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas .
a scep@@ tic is the en@@ doc@@ rin@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work involves the evaluation of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they were going through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later than usual .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the way of measuring should be used . &quot; &quot; &quot;
judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if we cannot say it , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Metro . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency advoc@@ ated the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is low . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in that case , this is about 10 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
on Wednesday , a concrete block of seven tons was installed at the bridge at the eastern city entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very good in time , it &apos;s great , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an of the Department of Road Construction and Transport in the government pres@@ idency of Freiburg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in April , the works began at the same time on all three rehabilitation bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach .
it is a arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 metres .
it was built in 1900 .
like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .
in order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated .
the other two bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10,@@ 60 metres long respectively .
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on Wednesday morning received a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons weigh@@ ted bridge cap on the northern side .
this is a border fast@@ ener that is also used as operating mode .
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way is to run .
the special thing about it is that it is finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges .
special finger@@ tip feeling has required the laying of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
in addition , fish and cra@@ bs had to be f@@ ished .
for the bridges between the building yard building and the collection point in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the construction work on the bridge at Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is fully locked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cost of the three bridges tot@@ aling 700 000 Euros .
the whole thing is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under Protest at German potato salad
it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to put under a hat .
the parties represented in the Krei@@ stag party ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D invites R@@ ond@@ ell to a poster &quot; big election campaign &quot; in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle .
and well @-@ known names for the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch .
but those who are on the spot for hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ speakers but demonstrate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; originally planned , the city picnic under the slogan &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; All at a table &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is planned on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but is now on the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ell - and therefore right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a colorful picture that is offered .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organis@@ ers , is really happy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; there are music and lots of food , including an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; original German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the station , which is only a few meters away from the venues .
how did the Af@@ D come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pe reports about the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel , he tried to make such an event and got the supplement .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes not enough parking spaces are available .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ me is pleased that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this also does : at 20 o &apos;clock on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stadthalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge .
in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the election of the German Bundestag , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k to talk about their speeches .
the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening .
a little more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock .
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ ists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church .
together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music .
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have solo positions in top European orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the solo orchestra of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
both unite the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .
Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gown , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; World Music , &quot; combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz guitarist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , mix classical , jazz and free playing to a fascinating overall art work .
this core of the program was only premier@@ ed this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher monastery church with its special acousti@@ cs is consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her Bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on their bis@@ ex@@ u@@ ality . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; once I bite into grilled cheese I think : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most well @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bitter@@ ly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite all this , the brunette performer ass@@ ures the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s B@@ az@@ aar &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with whom I have warned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
or do you think I &apos;d have played it ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed in du@@ alism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so it has never been confused or obstruc@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have never liked to be taken seriously . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she suffered particularly in school time when she dressed like a boy : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that really hurt me very much .
when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy .
I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed .
now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; .
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially the public doesn &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people expect you to move in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and perhaps some refer to me as ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like having to justify myself from the whole public . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tr@@ ump to change the party .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thou@@ ght@@ ful thinking ... Today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Republi@@ cans , &quot; Justice added .
&quot; as a coach , I would say it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
justice , which according to For@@ bes is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 .
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states , and has inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a declaration stating that &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather hin@@ der us than working to make our country terri@@ fic again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the f@@ ew@@ est legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC leader Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News .
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be res@@ um@@ ed into the sport .
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ lac@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all the athletes who were scra@@ pped off gold and silver med@@ als in competitions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the repor@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the whole Council and the entire congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some fairly hot days and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ E said he was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; Co@@ e said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean ath@@ lete from the corrupted system , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players .
the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , announced on Monday that Russia had to meet some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment .
drug tests are still inadequate and prohibited trainers still work freely , he said repor@@ ters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council .
funeral service for soldiers trunc@@ ated in Mali
at a funeral service in the north Hes@@ sian F@@ ritz@@ lar roughly 1000 people of the two soldiers killed in Mali with a helicopter crash .
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
the Minister of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) , said nothing to the un@@ explained crash .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she called the two opposite pilots but as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ön@@ ner of her specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from North H@@ esse had died a week in West African Mali on Wednesday .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a dead guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
at noon , only the families in the church took leave .
after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics .
among them were also Hess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
ro@@ ses laid down ro@@ ses , their relatives were arm in arms on the coff@@ ins .
in front of the church , F@@ ritz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Minister of Defense of the Le@@ yen called the opposite soldiers as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and sat@@ anic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operation of the helicopter tiger in F@@ ritz@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ chs , commander of the regim@@ ent , to whom the soldiers belong , declared : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; doubt about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of the Le@@ yen did not show : commitment is dangerous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a country from which we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the funeral ceremony , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral .
when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr does not provide any information .
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death .
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision to continue her message .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried , be still uncle@@ ar .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 he would have liked to become king .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in 2016 he retired and took the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself equal to his wife - not even after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish roy@@ alty .
where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , be still uncle@@ ar .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French home , but in Denmark .
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
born in 1965 , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French no@@ bility , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London in 1965 .
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French embassy .
during his later wife , during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing in his nearly 50 @-@ year @-@ old rule .
in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed .
my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk sm@@ ur@@ fs instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .
even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of society @-@ critical intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence .
I was different .
I seemed happy to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; these were two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Land@@ tag , but he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was speaking on Friday for the resolution of the Parliament .
previously the resig@@ nation of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties from their State Parliament faction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
five months before the official date of the Parliament election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament against the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the previous Green Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ ests founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group leader , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ys@@ ler , wants to recommend to his group to accept them . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this way , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , the SPD and the Green 68 seats .
so far the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to be scheduled on January 14th next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the pop@@ u@@ list said that the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether to go@@ vern it in this situation without a majority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , Stephan Wei@@ l believes that the country &apos;s day as soon as possible decides his self @-@ resolution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the state constitution also provides the possibility that the parliament &apos;s parliament el@@ ects trust and chooses a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; these options have to be thoroughly checked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ur@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will discuss all questions in peace if they are judi@@ cially reviewed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Th@@ ys@@ ler called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a little bit strange . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the politi@@ cian herself stressed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am not a tra@@ it@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a trailer of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their state mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume , of course , that they have given immediate effect to their state mandate , which they have received through the green country list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the regional leaders Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Group president of the Green Anja P@@ iel said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ests extra@@ ordinarily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has deliberately decided not to pron@@ ounce any pron@@ unciation in the Group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even before the background , there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the resig@@ nation of El@@ ke T@@ ests , Lower Saxony , to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the behaviour of former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the Federal Chancellor of the Socialists and Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly choose the parliament .

Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from Gi@@ f@@ tei@@ ern , Mr. Schmidt ?
Germany disc@@ usses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) and answer .
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from pois@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp print .
on the consumer protection portal www.@@ Lebensmittel@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information about the affected egg bat@@ ches .
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
even if according to everything we currently know , a health hazard is practically excluded .
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really noticed by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
nevertheless , my house has been dis@@ connected without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since the announcement of Germany .
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
trade has just as the manufacturers ensure that the products sold are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health .
if the residual pressure level of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not capable of traffic .
un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can , however , be sold and consumed .
this time the companies are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the present state of knowledge , the production enterprises are not directly responsible .
on the contrary , they must reck@@ on with economic damage due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies .
as always , there are too little controllers in the emergency .
is it missing only on the staff or at the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
the truth is , however , that food fraud and energy can never be exp@@ elled to 100 percent .
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where crimes can be given are of decisive importance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have already made it clear that I expect a complete enligh@@ tenment from the responsible authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
is regular alarm mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consumers have the right to exclusively get safe and capable food . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the imp@@ lied means are manufacturers , distributors and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in principle , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is not acceptable and must be termin@@ ated immediately .
at all levels it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure on all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts will be solved quickly and without gaps .
how the football rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules that aim to prevent un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from UEF@@ A , as the executive organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .
financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses .
Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million ) to extract the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year .
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can certainly make the money loose , so that N@@ ey@@ mar subscri@@ bes and brings him into a galax@@ y of other stars , given the financing of the team by the wealthy ruling family of Qatar .
associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must be subject to legitimate income sources that allow them to reach the break @-@ even point in their business @-@ related business .
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners with@@ drew their support .
in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from focusing on the debt of clubs to supervis@@ ing their losses .
the change meant that the business model , which originally used the novel Abra@@ movi@@ ch in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter .
during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period that runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amoun@@ ting to € 30 million .
and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the pres@@ idency in 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Alek@@ s@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to dis@@ courage her excessive expenditure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely rein@@ force the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P compared to The Associ@@ ated Press in the past week . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a package , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract .
N@@ ey@@ mar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the det@@ achment rates for the next five years will be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.4 million euros in the annual financial statements .
the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 , the PS@@ G combined with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has hit the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions .
the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ ride their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue from companies that are associated with the owners of a club .
while a cataly@@ st company could sponsor PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not leave it as legitimate in@@ comes .
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor@@ ship of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments of the World Cup 2022 organizational committee in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar World Cup ambassador will be and such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could be easy to figure out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be more attentive to take note of any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot; &quot; &quot;
UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announc@@ ing Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .
they talked about the condition of anon@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year have to be published .
PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot sales .
the association assumes that sales after signing by at least 30 percent will rise .
the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players go and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s away by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the president of the La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar &apos;s last ownership to PS@@ G . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes very difficult to respect the financial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fair@@ play &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new g@@ og@@ gi@@ ver supplier
over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has produced board chocolate for Swiss .
now the sweet co @-@ operation is in front of a possible end : the airline will re@@ write the order .
on request of the news agency , Swiss @-@ speaker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; on Friday .
according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white cardboard boxes packed at 14 grams per year distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers .
Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; industry insi@@ ders estimate the volume of orders in line with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but more important is the effect of advertising : it is a prestigious order for a chocolate manufacturer .
the Swiss will not want to reveal how many applicants do with the new call for ten@@ ders .
but only Swiss manufacturers come into question .
according to the newspaper article , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the contract for spring 2018 .
for the s@@ da , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .
Swiss Life has distributed chocolate boards on board their flights since 2006 .
before the Swiss signed a Mig@@ ros subsidiary agreement , Bar@@ ry Cal@@ le@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g .
Swiss was introduced two and a half years ago with the launch of the cooperation with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
on long @-@ haul flights , the First Class customers will be spo@@ ilt by the conf@@ is@@ erie Spr@@ ün@@ gli , in Business Class nas@@ chen passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
also on the short circuit , Swiss Scho@@ gg@@ i is distributed by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , both in business and economy class .

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
this repetition of history is simultaneously nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s , for the 90 @-@ year @-@ Gr@@ unge era ( as the pione@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Rud@@ d went to bigger things .
as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ ody and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time was scar@@ ce .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first Day of Camp &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd lob@@ ster ( it contained an original story for a talking tin vegetables that was spoken by H. J@@ on Benjamin ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
by stiff@@ ening themselves at the core of the g@@ ag - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ten Years L@@ ater &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; with adults now playing adults , is less emo@@ tionally rooted and his par@@ ody goes more to the principle of casting , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 &apos;s as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the Cra@@ dle &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at one point , a character rum@@ bles through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
the gra@@ cious C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) .
Victor ( K@@ en Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there is another crazy evil plot in which Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is included , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
as always , the ex@@ positions are the best part of the fran@@ chise .
it &apos;s a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ ies of &quot; sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker .
it &apos;s the moments of accidental ins@@ an@@ ity that could heat up this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches that which I think as his logical conclusion : &quot; wet Years L@@ ater &quot; whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot;
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members another kind of nostal@@ gia : to revi@@ ve the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ west @-@ west @-@ w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography .
the com@@ edy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka as director announces to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism .
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alo@@ gues are synchron@@ ized by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt in English .
it is an ingen@@ ious idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to watch ( the police take the time to watch chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ë Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - takes care of a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; .
but &quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much involved in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ ag@@ an mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
there are six long episodes , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough .
&quot; com@@ rade Det@@ ective , &quot; who was re @-@ edited on a smaller length could better deliver its ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who dev@@ our a bunch of bur@@ gers .
the message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with thei@@ rs .
strike against drugs ma@@ fia in the country
the police succeeded in crus@@ hing the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor announced on Friday .
fifteen accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
in addition , the officials ensured greater amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros .
with the same ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans .
the two will probably be shipped to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the campaign .
altogether more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use .
the ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder as well as rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail .
the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office of Const@@ ance has been investigating the organised drug traffi@@ cking in Southern Germany since the summer of 2016 .
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Const@@ ance and Palermo was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
therefore , on Wednesday morning the large insert was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .
the focus of the investigations was primarily Italian nation@@ als with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
an incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .
fashion compl@@ ains large gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; data of citizens who should not emerge &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : according to a report , the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has considerable defects . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions on asylum procedures .
according to a media report , the commission@@ er for the refugee management of the German government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed out to large gaps in the country &apos;s central register .
&quot; &quot; &quot; defici@@ encies in the data recorded there may lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; severe mis@@ decisions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; warned them in an analysis presented by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the figures , ten million people are registered with foreign citizenship , including about 5.@@ 7 million non @-@ EU countries .
the data is therefore administered by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
because the data has not been maintained sufficiently , the data quality in parts has not been good until now .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the Register anymore . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; incorrect data entries can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the statistics on sufficient tax@@ able people , EU citizens are also covered , which would not have to go out at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but such mis@@ concep@@ tions led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to a distorted debate on dealing with ex@@ tri@@ c@@ ents , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is said in the analysis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they have entered from there .
this goes out of an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück@@ er Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the paper it is said that the BA@@ MF carries out such procedures &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of inf@@ ants and inf@@ ants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper disc@@ usses the difficult situation on site .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees trying to reach it first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry wall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Office now writes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the recording capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Italy submitted guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments enough .
other EU states would also return refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the domestic speaker of the left @-@ wing inquiry in the Bundestag , Ull@@ a Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; families with children thre@@ aten un@@ lawful recording conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
second best result achieved
in a total of 220 litres of blood from persons living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service was already available to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were awarded the Friday .
above all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who with his now 100 donations now divided 50 litres of blood .
traditionally , the congregation acknowled@@ ges multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood at the session of the Municipal Council .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ingen@@ ious how our body is laid out for it and we pay attention to the don@@ ors who provide their blood for foreigners , nor un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; under@@ lined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a single blood donation will help several people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the county leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .
at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions performed in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K county leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
obviously , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago .
before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Sh@@ ort@@ cake were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations .
half as many books Herbert Ma@@ ir and Dor@@ o@@ thee Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe V@@ etter left ten times a 500 milli@@ liter of their juice .
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened spec@@ ulation over a rise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers in the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members staying in this month since weak economic growth has weakened the support for an increase .
in its quarter@@ ly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and for 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on bud@@ get@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .
but she sign@@ alled that interest increases would be necessary over the next few years to raise the inflation heated by Bre@@ x@@ it , and she said that credit costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
the members also agreed to withdraw part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimulus package published one year after Bre@@ x@@ it .
it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from the next February , although it has been said that it is expected to make 15 billion pounds available in the framework of this system - at 115 billion Po@@ unds Sterling .
&quot; &quot; &quot; minutes after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of the M@@ PC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as pressure on the real income of households continues to burden consumption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be needed to cool inflation and a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot; &quot; &quot;
markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
however , the Bank emphas@@ ised that increases would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot;
the downward @-@ corrected growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % predicted in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
the decision on no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations on a rise in net interest and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % to 0.3 % in the previous three months .
growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the end of the year .
the recent inflation report offers little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ tening is getting worse before it gets better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years can not &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prevent the in@@ comes of income &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages will be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end of their three year forecast . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the economy is also strengthened by the increasing demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of the lower consumption expenditure .
the decision comes one year after lowering the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the shock@@ ing EU vote caused by the sin@@ king of the ground .
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until it will fully achieve the prices and the economy .
before the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July demanded an increase to 0.5 % .
inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will put it on again in the coming months .
the Bank said that exceeding its target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Andrew mon@@ aut , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the recent decline in swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again as the len@@ ders are looking lou@@ dly to businesses and want to finish the year in a positive way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals are exp@@ elled and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug
&quot; &quot; &quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight against the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS . &quot; &quot; &quot;
N@@ HS England announced that a pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) taken prior to the sexual intercourse can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , from the health service to a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people .
he agreed to finance the process after the Court of App@@ eal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announced chess train was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; while the National A@@ ids Trust ( NA@@ T ) described it as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; crucial moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .
pre@@ text pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p reduces the HIV transmission in case of infection at risk .
pre@@ p prior to sexual intercourse means that just enough medications are present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and individuals with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .
in hospitals , suitable candidates will be identified who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment .
people who live in England and registered with a family doctor may also opt @-@ in to participate in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will be signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week following an international competitive sourcing .
the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .
&quot; &quot; &quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National A@@ ids Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .
pre@@ p , if it is targeted on vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic .
from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ian Green , Chairman of the Executive Board of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV is left behind . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine has been proc@@ ured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Shar@@ on H@@ od@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as a part of our approach to HIV prevention and to end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected and that it will contribute to the end of the spread of HIV in society . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
living the Great Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , res@@ ized in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment .
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne did not pack and sell her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived in a much larger room with my former in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; Jo@@ anne says .
&quot; I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot size of the apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led .
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne Shel@@ ter and an mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .
that was my requirement , &quot; she says .
for this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne .
the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand .
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stack@@ ed over each other without having to bend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to attach the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this arrangement allowed Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama .
for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area .
mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage style Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program .
the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .
a short corridor is mirr@@ ored at both ends to make it seem longer .
in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance there are mirr@@ ored units place for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne .
through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .
folding kitchens are nothing new .
what is special about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a bit of engineering art was going in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is so important that if you push the door up , it sli@@ ps very easily . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne could gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued , &quot; says Er@@ fan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a real estate agent will enter into a vesti@@ gi@@ al form and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high @-@ quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the materials are the things that you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls .
these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that a flat can transform itself through good design and an increased square met@@ er@@ ome of something standard in something quite amazing .
in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them .
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a debate because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million .
the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided .
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 , but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood .
there the West@@ co jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
this money has been invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brun@@ swi@@ ck and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs .
after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - written by Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third .
a court record states that this means that Col@@ in owns property worth $ 3@@ 16 million and has a value of 176 million dollars .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of interest for Paul .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the det@@ ach@@ ments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .
the brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him .
Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some pos@@ sessions in@@ compet@@ ently .
in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hopes to settle the dispute .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my Italian inheritance dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs rise , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms .
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen shops from the late 1950 &quot; s and bought a shop in Brun@@ swi@@ ck in the early se@@ ven@@ ties .
they took advantage of the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first den@@ im of the family .
Col@@ in says he began West co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis group of companies , with Col@@ in claiming that Mark has paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; both Luke and Mark are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become bitter about the conditions of her financial separation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very much , although he was a former AF@@ L member of the board and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to dress me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current battle , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , and added that he &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Friday , this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the pres@@ idency &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others tried it and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
if so , he will be the first .
Poli@@ tico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course .
here is a piece of repor@@ ter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with executive staff on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House that he wants to repair : poor information that came into the hands of the president .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Kell@@ ys Diagnose makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet .
President Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was angry for unfair coverage , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions to convince , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Poli@@ tico . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the key to keep Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaig@@ ners there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials are aware of something we do not know - that Tr@@ um@@ ps twe@@ ets would have included even more ignition material without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
if his employees managed to keep him away from him several times , their efforts have been worthwhile .
but no one has consistently been able to prevent tr@@ ump disputes .
part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of competing parties will always try to present their own agenda by presenting tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world .
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ors to bring du@@ bi@@ ous information to the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by Repor@@ ter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ smith :
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; current and former dump officials say that tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press cli@@ pp@@ ings , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and to find out where they originate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to be &quot; the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House .
although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ anes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; tr@@ ump read the article and began asking people about Wal@@ sh . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Gold@@ smith added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence .
these un@@ changing factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for .
the police all over Europe ship to dangerous criminals in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards .
since the addresses of the sought @-@ after heavy criminals are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday the action that follows the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; advent calendar from winter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the experiences had shown that many volati@@ le tourists hide from holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol .
I have put together 21 post@@ cards for the sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
36 of the online market@@ places could have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of references after publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands stand again with a few resol@@ ute travelers on the batt@@ le@@ field , tra@@ ded by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside a prosper@@ ous street of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; Million@@ aire Series . &quot;
they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were thrown out only in May without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es .
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; &quot; &quot; angry citizens pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
an anonymous resident said : &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Council must be forced into action by shame , as it was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the passengers were there in May , were moved and are now back .
more came last night , probably today even more . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long brief@@ ings to protect its parks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue paying my church tax if the Council can &apos;t stop it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a resident who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the figures have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of the Soli@@ hull council said : &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them as fast as possible .
in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the former Hotel Birken@@ hof will be located at the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
because with the closure of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the former Ambiente Betriebs@@ gesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014 approximately 30,000 over@@ nights were lost per year and revenue from the tourist tax also went .
in autumn 2014 , in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district , the hotel building was offered to the Land@@ rats@@ amt as a collection shelter .
the city prevented the placing of asylum seek@@ ers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt Lord Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties to the house .
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ isen@@ yi with Managing Director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , based in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel Birken@@ hof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof you have been building sh@@ utt@@ les before the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation works are made .
the floors have been torn out , ceilings are broken down , old baths from the rooms are removed .
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to be done by March .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot; &quot; &quot;
everything should be renewed in the style of the Black Forest .
the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is remo@@ del@@ ed , new windows are built .
&quot; &quot; &quot; everything should become &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pretty bourgeois &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities .
you don &apos;t want to position yourself on the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on a high level of inner city , Sch@@ erer empha@@ sizes .
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its 60 rooms , wants to spread wide , explains Sch@@ erer .
individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel .
he has already conducted talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sh@@ a@@ vers .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to pin@@ point exactly .
under one million euros , he reck@@ ons .
the outside systems are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible .
there is a large terrace in an inner courtyard that will be accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public .
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optim@@ istic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Repres@@ entative places Grand Jury
in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special investig@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee received the work in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on appeal to people familiar with the matter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the paper took the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded his investigation and intensified his investigation .
the CN@@ N broad@@ ca@@ ster reported that there are already the first dischar@@ ges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services accused the Krem@@ lin for a long time being targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps election campaign team and Moscow .
the investigation is focused on several men who acted as advis@@ ers to the Republi@@ can in the election campaign .
according to report , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more tr@@ um@@ ps of a private and business environment under the micro@@ scope .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Tr@@ ump has personally moved into the centre and under@@ took the accus@@ ation whether the president could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary during the affair . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to be charged . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Grand Jury are therefore also called accus@@ ations .
most of the time they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases .
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office to charge persons to the inter@@ ro@@ gation under E@@ id .
according to the CN@@ N station , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
persons involved in the meeting were called upon to make a statement , called it in the report .
in addition , they should provide documents .
in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. Tr@@ um@@ ps were also advis@@ ors and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ h@@ ner as well as his dam manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the sub@@ stitution would show that Mu@@ eller did not let himself be in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated in his work and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .
but it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end in order to decide on the rise of an indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the issue gives the demo@@ crats a chance to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because they have nothing else that they can talk about . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his special advisor , T@@ y Cob@@ b , explained in a statement that he did not know anything about the sub@@ stitution of a Grand Jury .
but this usually works in secret , he stressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the White House advoc@@ ates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former FB@@ I chief , James Com@@ ey , said three times that he would not be determined against the president .
one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the explanation .
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after having fired Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of this plo@@ y , accus@@ ations against tr@@ ump have become loud ; he wanted to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Com@@ ey testified in June of a Senate committee that urged him to set up an investigation against former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n .
the president is under great pressure for the examination .
according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees .
this triggered spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller wanted to dis@@ miss .
unlike an independent specialist in the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theore@@ tically be fired at the pres@@ idency of the President of the Ministry of Justice .
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators presented draft laws on Thursday , after which the special agent could no longer be dis@@ missed .
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic Eis@@ berg is driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
in the western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has loos@@ ened from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
the col@@ os@@ sus , weighing approximately one tril@@ lion and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , is now driving north and will probably need two , three years until he has mel@@ ted .
with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .
there is no danger for people from him .
the extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the ic@@ e@@ berg is uncle@@ ar after research data .
in total , however , for around 30 years there have been a series of unusual break@@ through@@ s of ice cream cones in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background .
according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming .
the col@@ os@@ sus now de@@ pl@@ eted was part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Shel@@ ter flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big gl@@ ac@@ iers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off on a regular basis .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
North of this ice shelf the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking was disturbed a few years ago .
A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete ice shelf there .
there is a lot to say that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is in danger , because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present .
in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can fall apart , if at a key site breaking a piece .
the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squee@@ ze ice as much water as it results after melting .
however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the gl@@ ac@@ iers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before .
this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only in a small degree , the British research project writes about the observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth biggest cont@@ ingent of Antar@@ c@@ tica after A@@ WI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres .
at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the most popular withdrawal from the beginning of the record , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
scientists have argued whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ p.dll may grow back or go back in the long run and possibly collap@@ sing , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
even if these researchers do not return to climate change , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has fallen apart during the last decades .
this long skir@@ t of the Antar@@ ctic stretches in the direction of South America .
according to the British Antar@@ ctic Survey research program , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
over the last 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest .
CD@@ U wants house tari@@ ff at the staff
because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vac@@ an@@ cies , the CD@@ U demands to withdraw from the employers &apos; association to become more attractive .
just before the summer break , 41 new jobs have passed through the administration .
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now , once again , 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them .
the teachers at the circle are obviously very much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were reported for the places that were to be released this year .
nevertheless , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks .
at present there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann .
among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are sought .
in the Krei@@ stag , the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the management should develop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs of skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented approach of applicants &quot; scar@@ city .
the overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG .
this sounds like a good approach .
for the circle has to do with personnel problems that you previously did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; speech is of a regular &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; competition of the public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this includes a high number of employees who leave the service for illness or age .
thus , it is time to take action so that there are no more places left un@@ occupied .
but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , leader of the CD@@ U , still goes beyond the joint application with his party .
he had long taken care of a la@@ zy surprise in the circle &apos;s day when he publicly questioned the costs of personnel and the rest of the parties start@@ led .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be verified that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice , the county government with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ related towns - should strive for a house tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said peoples . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in doing so , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually fores@@ ees the public service tari@@ ffs .
the sal@@ aries are currently strictly required , increases or more money exists only when one changes to a higher level oriented towards career years .
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitution protection law .
last but not least by the increasing number of asylum seek@@ ers , coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy exac@@ erb@@ ates the sound to NGO immigrants rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations .
&quot; if NGOs don &apos;t sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , &quot; said Minister of Interior Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a .
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities conf@@ is@@ cated a boat to the German charity organization &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a way facilit@@ ating illegal immigration .
the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to express a detailed alleg@@ ation of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Carto@@ sio .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on social media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can only judge all accus@@ ations currently being collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; boat , which I@@ u@@ vent@@ a has been monitoring since October . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is thought that its crew takes tu@@ bing migrants aboard , which are delivered to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can take off so that the ships can be used again .
at least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor of the prosec@@ utor , whose contents were published by Italian media .
the occupation is suspected of expos@@ ing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives .
under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must first have an Italian police officer who supervis@@ es their activities .
only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; significant changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
in recent weeks , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe .
climbs and Tri@@ als
nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bik@@ ers , the &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region for four days to enjoy trials and attractions .
for that there were three friendly guides available .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the castle and wine festival of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
view points , partly on towers , from which one could see far above the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald and the up@@ stream levels .
in between there were always longer asc@@ ents , for which long trials were rewarded .
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Pop@@ ular saus@@ age market .
again , the look@@ out spot went to the look@@ out spot , connected by &quot; flew &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents .
on the last two days a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers were announced .
caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and huts brought welcome breaks .
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine at the open @-@ air audi@@ torium .
also Neustadt was headed .
after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the Pf@@ äl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally .
console instead of lawn - Bundes@@ liga is equipped for e @-@ sport
in future , the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , rather than fighting with wind and weather over the stadium race ?
fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high amounts included .
these have also recognized the first federal li@@ ars who are increasingly involved in this field .
the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport department in mid @-@ July and took two pro@@ s for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we hope to inspire completely new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Chief Executive Officer Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is certain &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that some clubs still ascend on this train . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this weekend , the FIFA World Cup organized the first &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; in London , where gam@@ ers compete against each other .
in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven have qualified for example .
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year olds , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old .
and : the clubs tried to conquer all the possible markets , especially the Asian .
with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be present far more often on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Ci@@ tiz@@ ens to Asia .
what is it all about ?
during e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the football simulation FIFA have fought on competition level .
as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established themselves in which the pro@@ s compete against each other .
and in the Asian Games 2022 E @-@ Sport is already part of the official programme .
but is it really a kind of sport ?
for many , the performance is getting used to the ordinary .
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ó has long argued with the question .
for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes .
it also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast response capability .
professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise on the console , but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the custom player is a good player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but she also sees problems : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
controls were difficult to perform on online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sport were missing .
the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport .
the players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .
a study by the management consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts the rapid growth of e @-@ sport .
by 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tournaments .
in three years , turnover is expected to be 130 million .
that is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte coun@@ sell@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sports Wett@@ erer Uni@@ kr@@ n .
there is a lot to do in Europe as well .
in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport has been introduced as a pedago@@ gical subject , says F@@ rob@@ oso .
in the Netherlands and France , according to D@@ utt , the soccer club clubs in the Netherlands are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the European comparison , Germany lag@@ s behind , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B CEO R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to decay only in nostal@@ gia and to clear the old times is not enough today .
it is about maintaining the tradition of the association , but at the same time alig@@ ning the company to the modern market .
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; meaning D@@ utt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can &apos;t cling to that only when football is all the way it was . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the lyrics by Con@@ rad Roy to commit suicide
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend with lyrics and calls for suicide .
Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation .
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for a negli@@ gent killing of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my family is not comfor@@ ting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appeal .
she had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness .
dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she ended his life to make her own better . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she has not shown re@@ mor@@ se . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; but Car@@ ters attorney said it was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance that she fully regre@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
judge La@@ wr@@ ence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions . &quot;
a prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t feel the loss of my beloved son .
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pain we will carry for eternity with us to be there for his sisters , &quot; says it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a aunt for his children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not to have this single person with whom I was together every day since I was born , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to demand another to commit suicide .
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide intoxic@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case drew national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that she had encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hang up , spring from a building , wake yourself up , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said in several messages she sent during the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the moments before his suicide it wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case by any press .
the case has shared the legal opinion .
among the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted in 2007 because of murder of her British ro@@ omm@@ ate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , in the Los Angeles Times published a comment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m of FC Bayern
the fact that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coinci@@ dence .
the FC Bayern e@@ ats a big season to the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner - extra motivation is not harmful .
something was different at his place in the cabin , that looked after Joshua Kim@@ mich immediately , even if the extra piece of clothing was very , very small .
but as far and broad@@ ly on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course no Philipp L@@ ah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er were to be seen , he made his split stick to the arm .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first deployment as Bayern @-@ captain . &quot; &quot; &quot;
well , the stand could have run better than at 0 : 2 vs the SS@@ C Naples .
but the character of the coach could also be interpreted by Kim@@ mich .
not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal had been chosen as a game leader in the C @-@ El@@ f , which was composed of youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday , but he .
sugar is best distributed to those with a lot of herbs that you want to keep in your mood .
so those who were chosen to take the heritage of L@@ ah@@ m can only use a little extra motivation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kim@@ mich confirmed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed as Mini @-@ L@@ ah@@ m over the field .
right behind , this is now its position , the white band@@ age at the arm did its rest .
and at all Kim@@ mich was in this start@@ page like the one who can best take the helm .
he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ att@@ un@@ ed tro@@ upe .
he had the view for the whole , while many others were occupied with himself .
V@@ idal thus , to re@@ play his missing fitness ( barely collap@@ sed ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches reli@@ ed on the devil to get out of the services of the Asia @-@ journey ( fold only condi@@ tionally ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le did not neg@@ atively impact on their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ k@@ ot .
after all , it worked very well .
Sü@@ le ran alongside Kim@@ mich , Rud@@ y in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently .
the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm often proved difficult , and addic@@ ts also tried a few times in the game build @-@ up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his colleague Rud@@ y ad@@ mitt@@ edly admitted that the result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was not as we had hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance in the debut .
&quot; &quot; &quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was also picked up for this style . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as unusual this Bayern world is still for the new entran@@ ces , one looked after the game .
Rud@@ y , for example , did not present one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but for six or seven interviews .
Kim@@ mich said good@@ bye to his new fellow players after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting sentence : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what is going on here , I have already noticed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you just have to win any game in Bavaria . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore .

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : business pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able that the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate .
this shows itself after more than a year in which the new business minister Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T @-@ demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest revers@@ al of the revers@@ al is nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
this year , the ministry is hoping for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be right .
a role in the plans of the country is also played by the West@@ um@@ geh@@ ung Trier , which is in the urgent need of the federal traffic route plan .
the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says Minister @-@ Spe@@ aker Cornel@@ ia Hol@@ t@@ mann .
nat@@ us sees it as a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies .
as by Wis@@ ser , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) aims to promote a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate @-@ Label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German exports for ten years .
in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people wanting to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce pra@@ ises .
in the new master bonus , the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach .
a premium of 1,000 euros is provided for the passed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates become self @-@ employed within ten years of their master &apos;s education .
however , the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
in the planned road construction , there are quickly facts to be created , at the same time lacking the country with the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , Managing Director of the Chamber of Commerce of Trier .
only 29 positions have been occupied until now by 56 new engineers who want to hire Wis@@ ser at the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility .
the Chamber of Commerce is calling for more jobs to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf is referring to calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros in the preservation of country roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also anticip@@ ates a country &apos;s concept as to how to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
the existing broad@@ band expansion in the country is also so@@ ber@@ ing .
in 2016 , regional companies had rated power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a score of 3,@@ 4 .
they compl@@ ained about stock@@ ing internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Minister for Economic Affairs , E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
the Green Party left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where after four months they had already cleared the field for dis@@ agreements .
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a back@@ lash
one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software to more than 35@@ 0,000 vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the BMW Group said the company believes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore referred to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or restrict . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe will be modi@@ fying in order to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described under@@ tak@@ ings as recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
but nitrogen oxi@@ des which em@@ it diesel engines are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma .
the cost of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutr@@ alization of exhaust f@@ umes dischar@@ ged from diesel vehicles also take to what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of conce@@ aling the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing signs of the problem .
the companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called depreci@@ ation devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but returning to normal driving conditions .
several employees were accused of Volkswagen in the United States , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic .
last month , the former Head of Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .
the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ ch@@ eo Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from ex@@ tradition and could be brought to court in the United States .
at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States has been expanded .
Volkswagen &apos;s involvement in the study could be heavily imp@@ acted by Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to Volkswagen win over propor@@ tionally .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message .
those who go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday will see a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke .
and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists .
but the building department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large inf@@ otainment branch .
it shows a refuse berg .
the pr@@ el@@ ude to a publi@@ city campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the motto &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; True Love is ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shall shar@@ pen the understanding of the Is@@ ar as a protective wild river . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last summer the raft drove over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are more actions and measures to achieve a ru@@ th@@ less and environmentally conscious behavior .
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
at times , Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was one of the most widely published carto@@ on sket@@ ches , the pupp@@ y @-@ n@@ oses of his characters are his trademark .
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian still records and works on a film .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his message : laughter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he was a sig@@ nat@@ ory of greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said .
after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world .
even in China Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o found many fans .
the artist was always inspired by cities .
large , rounded mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .
in the early morning , according to his own data , he still sits on the drawing table , working daily for almost ten hours .
over cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his cute figures continue to find a lot of dis@@ semination around the world .
since six years he has also been working on a carto@@ on and a TV series with his figures .
the main character in the film &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los of any animal in his drawings - which has an exchange bucket as a counter @-@ player .
for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are going to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ ll@@ o .
the script is not written by him .
that is why he rather relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless .
Lav@@ ender in Provence threatened by climate change
it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .
the la@@ ven@@ der is dec@@ lining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of d@@ rought and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , causes great head@@ aches .
Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M Agricultural Research Institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and in the fall much more .
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
there is also a small z@@ ic@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transfers d@@ war@@ ves , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant clo@@ cks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
the solutions that are considered include a better water distribution and slow@@ ing down evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective blend of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dr@@ y@@ ness .
the little town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian town of R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 years of existence .
the highlight of the festival is Saturday and Sunday with a Medi@@ eval Festival .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly Ri@@ od@@ ce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt official and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars .
but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about security .
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them home .
security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies .
they ask the repor@@ ters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , percep@@ tions and gut feelings reach .
there are drug s@@ mu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .
there is no rest from violence , and while the bodies accum@@ ulate throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to has resig@@ ned in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .
among the latter is their publisher and their inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his absence is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; hangs on the facade of the Ri@@ b@@ odo@@ ce building . two repor@@ ters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut .
the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the repor@@ ters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia .
although a German Federal Prosecutor &apos;s Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists .
as with most thousands of mur@@ ders , which are linked every year with drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely presented in court .
at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still ins@@ ist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are not comfor@@ ting and although the terrain is now even more tra@@ it@@ or .
without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra .
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as long as we don &apos;t know why , we susp@@ end all . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the provincial capital of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ fth River . &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to be floating around in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the surrender to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .
it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two @-@ story Maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living .
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; rest &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trade routes in the United States .
despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend .
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
first of all , in February there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the competing anti@@ trust fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons .
this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks .
the second mistake was to not force Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper that had published the same story .
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced repor@@ ter for the Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues at the foundation of Ri@@ fu@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the problem of drugs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
over time , the newspaper has earned a reputation for cour@@ a@@ geous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .
repor@@ ters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to deal with .
eight years after the foundation of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for its reporting in Latin America .
in the same year , Val@@ dez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it led .
he volunte@@ ered that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you have to take over the task that you are looking for as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ri@@ fu@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was flu@@ ent like a do@@ ck@@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
he would always go to El Guay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .
now they ask : was his love for the routine to ruin ?
his death also forced them to question their own ass@@ ump@@ tions about how they can best deal with their work and stay alive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; these things were not permitted , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez .
the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation .
trust his own inst@@ inc@@ ts .
if it sm@@ ells wrong , stay away from it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the anger is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smell is a sense that can be fo@@ ol@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative s@@ mu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .
the landscape is changing constantly .
in the space where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .
outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the Ri@@ fa@@ ce offices in a four @-@ storey building in a mid @-@ size neighborhood of C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an .
half in the joke , some of the repor@@ ters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the polic@@ emen who were not trust@@ worthy to the governor .
it is months since the repor@@ ters have gone into the mountain scenery , where drug gangs are actually under control .
for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has spent three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former well @-@ known box@@ er Juli@@ o Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had a expos@@ é to the government spending , which concentrated on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in C@@ uli@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , conducting a kid@@ n@@ apping .
there was no official word about who was kid@@ n@@ apped or how it happened , so be@@ ware advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities .
a repor@@ ter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the reig@@ ning Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .
recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption due to high @-@ profile cases .
Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the repor@@ ter to write about previous incidents in this area , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack .
only a few months earlier , readers would have considered the Colum@@ ns of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kid@@ n@@ apping .
&quot; we had already known what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , nick@@ named &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Val@@ dez office became a storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that prot@@ ested against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .
repor@@ ter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an .
a burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; &quot; &quot; journalists have become lou@@ der in the whole country by writing in organised protests &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on paths and buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of scor@@ ing journalists and bringing them around because they told the truth .
she has since asked her to be re @-@ divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objec@@ tivity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; surrounded &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by organised crime , government officials and an equally valid society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that repor@@ ters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last year , the media guard group &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ar@@ ticul@@ o 19 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has allocated more than half of the attacks to journalists of the police and officials . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez .
obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her body was found along with a note signed by the Z@@ et@@ as cart@@ el : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a computer keyboard and headphones lie beside her separate head .
some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue , as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of her director in 2004 .
in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z openly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page titled &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists fled their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers .
and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to be the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z .
for those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions .
I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug traffi@@ cking has frigh@@ tened him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became repor@@ ter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and d@@ rank beer when all of their phones suddenly began to bu@@ b .
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with rival and security forces near the Maz@@ at@@ lan beach resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continued escal@@ ating as it was promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
from the edge of the ker@@ bs , they have published the latest news on the Ri@@ fa@@ ce website about mobile phones .
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ aped up close to - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez took a look at the police officers holding guards to see if they were in readiness .
if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it .
under the enormous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his traces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how can you only think about it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the same day when J@@ avier was murdered , the intern asked me to send her on the road . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade their enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue , al@@ beit a frigh@@ tening .
researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible N@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian mountain worker have been so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
it was so good that they could even determine that its sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said it had been something of a &quot; troubled past . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the report in the journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Current Biology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; described it as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ r living in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
his incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed researchers , who describe it as &quot; really remarkable . &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ge@@ aring her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es are the best preserved fossil of its kind .
it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
he met something that seemed out of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal inside the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of heavy pe@@ an@@ uts .
after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you only b@@ link a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature can be seen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa the Din@@ osau@@ r . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs .
the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from pre@@ dat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as mat@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals .
this would have allowed them to get better into their environment and avoid their enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by bigger din@@ osau@@ rs .
the 110 million @-@ year @-@ old creature from the family of the No@@ dose Au@@ rier made head@@ lines in May and is now seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta Mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to uncover it carefully .
the amazing preservation of the specimen made it possible for Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of shed and arm@@ or over his body .
they discovered the sh@@ ady , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side .
although the sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of the animals living today .
it points to the fact that the din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased from enough pressure by eating meat ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution encouraged the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to loo@@ t , indicating that this No@@ dose @-@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ or behaviour on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous din@@ osau@@ rs pre@@ dat@@ ors must have been cra@@ ck@@ ling time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
scientists continue to investigate the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including his con@@ served gut to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .
they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where it sank on the back to the se@@ abed .
at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flu@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans are probably much far@@ ther inland than they are today .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this No@@ dose Au@@ rier is truly remarkable , because it is completely covered with con@@ ser@@ rated sk@@ inn@@ ed skin but remains preserved in three dimensions and preserves the original form of the animal , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just want a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is sleeping . &quot;
the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when huge geo@@ des , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that stood on two legs crossed the earth .
although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors .
this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 @-@ foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons heavy monster .
the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud .
the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk as he dug in the S@@ unc@@ or M@@ illen@@ ium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada .
according to the museum , it is the buried din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip .
the creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 feet ) long and weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) .
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips that ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the tor@@ tured her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were swe@@ pt through the Western Canada until a floo@@ ded river floo@@ ded it into the open sea .
but the underwater exploration of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the st@@ alli@@ ons still cover b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &quot; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery .
the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it becomes .
pet@@ ri@@ fied rem@@ n@@ ants of the skin are still covered by the b@@ ump@@ y ar@@ mor@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed plates carrying the skull of the animal .
his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .
I can count the scales at its sole . &quot;
in the thunder@@ storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous wounded , miles @-@ long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er .
on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) about 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on Thursday afternoon .
after the first information of the police , between the junction points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) around 30 vehicles , among them probably trucks , crashed into each other .
there are no indications of the exact number of injured persons at first .
it was a light to moderate injury , said a police spokes@@ man .
a large array of ambul@@ ance vehicles was at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of the direction of Munich a ten @-@ kilometer back @-@ Dach@@ au formed .
as reported by an A@@ Z repor@@ ter , there was also massive obstruc@@ tions on the counter @-@ tra@@ j@@ ec@@ tory - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er .
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade listed the hall@@ marks of the vehicle lights , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing .
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : there is no way to sit in the train and sleep .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buffer .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes an unpleasant or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspection .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket inspec@@ tor .
you simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus de@@ valu@@ ate the ticket .
currently , a test operation runs on two routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; come the offer , we expand it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is expected to be available in many other long @-@ haul routes in Germany in the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a rail@@ road spokes@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; calls the rail ticket de@@ valuation without conductor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .
and you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway .
it is also necessary to have bought it via the app of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway .
last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; because the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; works : one climbs into the train , calling his ticket to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Tickets &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic evaluation will then appear in the test customers .
the train atten@@ d@@ ants get a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat y .
if the train driver arrives at the ticket inspec@@ tor at number Y , he knows that a passenger is seated with an already de@@ valued online ticket .
one can therefore continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent .
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the rail - which in turn should use the passenger .
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train crew will simply check the DB Navigator himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this enables passengers to make their journey more personal in the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB marketing management board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
those who often take the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspec@@ tors are among the biggest off@@ ences .
because often you have , in any case , one of the co @-@ travelers not all the documents needed for the de@@ valuation of online tickets .
either the credit card or the identity card is missing , or else a document that must be presented .
the result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger , leading to a bad mood in the section or large room and delays in the control of your own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns .
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s only on the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further train numbers on the same route are not yet un@@ locked .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Britt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was shaken to her core .
just one day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene sat on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone .
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from high school .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police just killed a 18 year old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
confused , because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly wor@@ shi@@ ped on their tim@@ eline .
the ra@@ pper of St. Louis &apos;s area was to twe@@ eten the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo .
he posted a picture of Brow@@ ns &apos;s le@@ thal body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she stopped her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and by a man who claimed to be the father &apos;s father who had a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she observed a live feed where a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman captured his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not common , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at that moment I felt shi@@ vers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I was angry and cried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she picked up her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the theme of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th .
it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which exists from the perspective of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers .
as Fer@@ rel with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two discussed a conversation that they had &quot; countless times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l later . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves .
even though I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blat@@ ant ra@@ cism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I feel I would do it a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place in front of the police authority , which became a camp site when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ prosecution of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson .
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined with a local owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l shape .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after 9 August , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it has come all . &quot;
weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted only to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a question came to mind : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this scep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often from wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said in an interview recently : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt occup@@ ants .
his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other natives , followed by the team of Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting .
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that was the main thing for me how these people are portra@@ yed , for so I will be portra@@ yed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the goal was not to concentrate on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it turned out to be the most open participant in the film .
as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love and mar@@ ries her wife .
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the person@@ alization of black people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , Ferr@@ ara &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves @-@ Mat@@ ter movement .
two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the movie &quot; Black@@ bird Mat@@ ter &quot; in the social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film because of her identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not a coinci@@ dence , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these junc@@ tions than a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
meanwhile the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the ra@@ cial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .
Fer@@ rel@@ l is prob@@ able for 2 ½ years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
still she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ del@@ usion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit gallery &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bit gallery moves people even though it is not built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian area divi@@ des the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
cold the topic hardly leaves one .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; while the one to the bit gallery says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no man needs &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meg@@ al@@ ley ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Lars Sch@@ olz ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , including the rest of the shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone is then ble@@ ed out .
in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products .
at the beginning of the construction work there will be an end .
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - to the Bed@@ a place with the opportunity to sit outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sim@@ one Room : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for many years we have bought almost a week in the farmer &apos;s market hall . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady always happy again .
we also discovered the but@@ cher &apos;s shop for us .
we would wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities , there is also .
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing enters a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of the rent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but this should not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous .
there is enough of them in our city .
you can see how many stores are empty here - some for months and years .
since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall is preserved .
after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is priced at the top .
as you can see , stores in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the r@@ ents there are often not portable for a retailer .
too bad , special shops are almost no longer and that which is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf Fan@@ del : &quot; a shopping m@@ all with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the peasant market hall go ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or does the G@@ bit Gallery make it possible to drive all business from Bit@@ burg before ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it just won &apos;t work .
and no one needs a shopping center that is empty .
in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market instead of this gallery .
but for a farmer &apos;s market hall give it thanks to the crazy many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
when the peasant market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a matching simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing &apos;s DNA
in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are visible - white , black and brown , which are almost im@@ percep@@ tible - which hang on cables from the ceiling .
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ pf@@ ern and Haar@@ lem , which were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former secret service analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after having publicly disclosed diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
the new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a matching resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline united her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gender and pioneering dissi@@ dent , whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated by the algorith@@ mic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as someone with these gen@@ om@@ ic data could look like , a keen , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the forms of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity .
Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft .
through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ and @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing was visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated .
in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg arrived just from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts such as cigarette but@@ ts and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from waste to produce an image of how these people might look .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while they were in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photograph@@ ed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .
the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became un@@ equal bri@@ efs that exchanged several letters over the course of two years .
they even created a Com@@ ic &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President would transform their verdict and would be able to personally see the exhibition .
that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published to call Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy coinci@@ dence .
there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump is conducting a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .
when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said , &quot; Things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing asked with her super@@ large signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation has been gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .
De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .
&quot; what people will hopefully take with you is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video factory of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , therefore the 30 of these stories . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel .
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears in the hands of the United States &quot; disciplinary bar@@ racks , like King Kong with a hands @-@ free speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the artist who gre@@ ets from Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it . &quot;
Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition in person yet - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , then she will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ res , who meet like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters .
this was also aimed at how everything was written in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from portraits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also hiding behind its liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee at Oxford University for killing
a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who are looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .
on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County .
the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several p@@ ens .
a common warning system published by the Chicago Police Department states that the body was discovered on July 27 .
officials got a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .
Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of action , and det@@ ec@@ tives investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects , said officials .
La@@ a has been an associate professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University since 2007 .
Alan K. Cu@@ b@@ bage , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ a must now be in a judge and excluded from entering the Nor@@ th@@ western University campus .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is now a criminal procedure which is examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Cu@@ b@@ bage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and the Somer@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement added that War@@ r@@ ens &apos;s colleagues were shock@@ ed and want him to stand .
chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them rein@@ force , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the susp@@ ects .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building who had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 .
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was uncle@@ ar whether the incident took place on July 27th .
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ a and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and expl@@ ores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA timet@@ able in the near future &quot; - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko
the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the WA@@ DA timet@@ able has been updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map for compl@@ ying with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ insertion of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and published recently on the organization &apos;s website .
according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the criteria listed in the list however stipul@@ ates that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to publicly subsidi@@ zed dop@@ ing in Russian sports .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has admitted a mistake . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Commission .
in conversation with Russian sales office r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov answered problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condi@@ tionally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing control in Russia in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing ( U@@ K@@ AD ) .
after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow Organisation in July , WA@@ DA CEO Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli stated that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moved in the right direction to be used again .
Al@@ di does not sell eggs at first
these divided the groups of companies .
it was a purely precau@@ tionary measure , it could be further assumed by no health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message .
from now on only eggs are delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested neg@@ atively on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ hal@@ ous anti @-@ lice defects .
Al@@ di wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your staff at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the poll@@ s did not work .
responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent .
and even if you promised anon@@ ym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process .
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed .
it has called people from the outside for help .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , to address employees anon@@ ym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors .
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .
Er@@ ret@@ t said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance what units have most ail@@ ments and which managers have low cons@@ ular results - so that you can re@@ boot why .
companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken were punished .
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this desire is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity .
global governance , regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments , a financial web site .
Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ anything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit .
Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la .
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
like G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent companies will send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
and when the main executive board is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when a company is found that treats its employees poor@@ ly or behave eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee fluctu@@ ation and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan .
Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters .
earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .
it was often a in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .
now that the company is using Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair intern@@ ships more quickly identified and addressed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group by Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment li@@ tigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies began to take ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed because of ethical clas@@ hes caused by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but it took until the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; social media came to their right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty washing went online . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said .
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recur@@ ring fees for the use of their products .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Con@@ ver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .
gl@@ itter@@ ing secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s venture partner and brought his entire financing to $ 60 million .
these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .
there is a growing complex of research that shows that today &apos;s employees expect more from their jobs than before .
in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bet@@ s .
the employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices , and that the work you do is profitable , then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ LIN@@ T .
investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action .
in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .
and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can breed dis@@ appointments and demo@@ tiv@@ ate employees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company of Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because if you do not follow employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; and who doesn &apos;t care about why should I ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now runs monthly staff surveys , was able to launch action on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ LIN@@ T .
and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems .
at Ru@@ by Tuesday the company always receives new insights about the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and if you lose customers , then you will lose your company .
N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it goes to 23 o &apos;clock as a lot of U@@ C@@ LA Foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tain on one side of the new training fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot @-@ tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team , these in@@ active minutes represent a lunch break .
players who are en@@ rolled at the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Aquari@@ us Football Center next morning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real treadmill for the boys next three days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a shortly before the Monday to Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of players , and it actually prolon@@ gs their days - at least until the final on Friday .
therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of players .
the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six seasons in West@@ wood underwent practical exercises .
they are supposed to keep 18 exercises during August . 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
Mor@@ a said that he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change of rules even if they add a further point to the players &apos; busy routes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and they simply pushed it through , they fu@@ elled further , they are great people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the U@@ C@@ LA will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class , which was already covered with foot@@ balls that were clearing a protective grid behind a gate post , no easy task .
bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a real problem and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people hire a room there and then adjust to record an exercise . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it is a fairly good business .
but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook seeks to intensi@@ fy fact @-@ checking in the fight against fake messages
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports from third parties and then display their results below the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network said on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news .
the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fact inspec@@ tors who may display results of the fact test from the original article .
Facebook has been critici@@ zed as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .
the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being floo@@ ded with false stories ahead of the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished by social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate h@@ asser@@ tive posts like before the elections there in September .
on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts check will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added that Facebook continues to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; related item &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and is working on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot; &quot; &quot;
creating a novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s .
but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Hav@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a mop@@ ha@@ i@@ y Yor@@ k@@ shire with a preference for historical documents .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says with one accord . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . &quot;
&apos;@@ a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenk@@ ie@@ wi@@ cz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Gre@@ enberg .
it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found un@@ expect@@ edly emo@@ tionally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only re@@ acted to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &quot; s , which worked for the Jac@@ o@@ bin@@ s , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb @-@ print !
and letters always smell like smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light .
for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would also be there .
Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
for someone who is so beaten with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ b &quot; ) seems to be all too beautiful to be true .
Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , view the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hydr@@ alls on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the tren@@ ch .
he walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .
&quot; &quot; &quot; then , at night he d@@ rank &quot; whis@@ key and started to write . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust had received full access until 2006 , when the last bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died .
when Rho@@ des had arrived a decade later , the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristoc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards that represent what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch fighting for the two families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; boys , let everything go his way ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base into the English story , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a record from a tur@@ mo@@ il who appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Rho@@ des . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good beginning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; perhaps the two are connected together ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like The Pri@@ est , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rol that the Dar@@ rel@@ l family hid for seven years during the English Reformation .
or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the s@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l portra@@ ys his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the lords seemed to be a fe@@ ather , always making debt and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise within . &quot;
after the end of his work in the castle Rho@@ des is searching for other unique scre@@ aming experiences
he has spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium dating back to the early 20th century , which has since been re @-@ challenged by nature .
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
with the v@@ eiling of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday .
until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .
at the end of August there will be a festival on Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th Island as the highlight of the campaign .
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; or ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking the poster on the poster on the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t really think ( of course ! ) , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they write on their web@@ page , which was released yesterday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we use this measure to attract your attention . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; basically we are convinced that we as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f citizens know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it means further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ encomp@@ assing promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after all , they compete with other local communities .
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign cost an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
each year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on pensions and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps .
so also this week .
at first glance , a normal process .
but nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .
the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions .
thus the Y@@ AS civilians were in the over@@ population .
the government attracts the re@@ ins in the military .
the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were dis@@ missed .
since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als .
more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wi@@ re@@ er of the coup attempt .
against 4@@ 86 persons who should have been involved directly at the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan called the overthrow attempt as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; God present &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; completely clean up the armed forces &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really handle the army ?
at the end of February , the newspaper Hür@@ ri@@ yet published an article entitled &quot; Dis@@ comfort in Military Head@@ quarters . &quot;
on the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests in the lifting of the head@@ line ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .
this is the case with the army and the security forces .
in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered more 7@@ 3@@ 95 state officers by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers .
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the real masters of the country earlier .
three times , they squ@@ ander@@ ed their role as guar@@ di@@ ans of the secular state order .
after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform of the European Union .
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan drives systematically the Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; an officer named by name , who sought asylum from fear of persecution abroad , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if this happens , such a development could not leave NATO cold .
anyway , there are doubts in the alliance according to the pur@@ ges of the Turkish army .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media .
he pre@@ fers to reduce legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as .
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ cans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pay@@ ers and will do this by changing the way the US will change the way citizens from other countries are dealt with Green Cards . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the current system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate track for road shuttle
over the past few months there has been a dispute over the future of the race car - now it should be quite fast .
before the end of the year , it is scheduled to be built on the ailing track on which the tourist train runs .
in order to secure the future of the racing driver in the long term , construction work will start on the track this year .
&quot; with the decision to continue and renov@@ ate the Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g route , the country is committed to this connection , especially for tourism , &quot; declared State Secretary Klaus expi@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt .
the cost of rep@@ airing the route was about 2.5 million euros .
the country sums up 75 percent of this sum .
the contract on which the shuttle will also be ordered in the future from the country will be finally voted , declared expi@@ ation .
the ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia railway as operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
the race @-@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be scheduled for a regular service on December 2017 .
the racing bike shuttle is an especially popular railway connection between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
in the course of a pilot operation over the past few months , it has been tested whether the route is used by sufficient number of people to order them regularly in the future .
the track is also very b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
just as you thought it can &apos;t be more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots comes .
yes , actually .
sex robots are currently a great thing .
recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robo@@ tics ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robo@@ tics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at She@@ ff@@ ield University and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must start taking their Ascension seriously .
customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pp@@ le and type of finger nail .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
modern sex d@@ olls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the user can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; customize &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples until the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it gets more wor@@ rying as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would have a step@@ ford @-@ wife look progressive .
modern sex d@@ olls have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
for example , the Real@@ Bo@@ ti@@ x robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness .
and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robots developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities like &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; advent@@ urous &quot; personality .
Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the website of True Compan@@ ion .
so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc .
in the course of the day , she also has her mo@@ ods - quite like real people !
&quot; &quot; &quot; she can be tired , be fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step towards fri@@ gi@@ d ( means : re@@ belli@@ ous ) Far@@ rah , rest@@ less one the most .
true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy was compared to a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex@@ toy .
their emergence and increasing sophistic@@ ation point to something dark and deeper in our culture , towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional en@@ core .
most men naturally do not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notices their growing popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture .
but what escap@@ es from the boundary zones can be very instruc@@ tive regarding the spirit of time in which we live .
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have sexually attacked women .
the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Ma@@ iden &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the mu@@ d@@ dy body and the cast eyes , but how realistic this vision works .
the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .
the goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical lik@@ eness to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their gro@@ wers want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; personalities &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
they have no mediation or background history , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total submission .
in other words , they are counter@@ f@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
Tr@@ um@@ ps great power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
it has become a certainty of the tr@@ ump era that the political divisions that have pol@@ arized the US elec@@ torate , have also split families in small @-@ format .
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ choosing relatives .
we are all strictly adher@@ ing to to blow our filter bags .
less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps to bring together families .
I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a left @-@ wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republi@@ cans in our family , visited me this week in New York .
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
with Tr@@ ump in the White House everyone whom she knows , including the republi@@ can relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side .
this is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it is important to me that this also brings considerable risks .
the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the app@@ alling effect of his pres@@ idency has the power to push all of us to the right .
when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; and tr@@ ump , we relate to the cre@@ ep@@ y way that his bi@@ bs of one day will no longer be thrown off .
however , there is still a terri@@ fying long @-@ term scenario in which the dump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing are &quot; norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness .
today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ak@@ ian version of the mad@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both in comparison to tr@@ ump in fact occur as very mild off@@ ences .
when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ cans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an im@@ meas@@ urable improvement .
when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Kar@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ous@@ el in the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine .
the horses are enormously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the cli@@ mati@@ sing music conve@@ ys this in a strange way .
so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream .
thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not fully aware of the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the topic Pub ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not - but a big round@@ about in northern London .
the Central Park Kar@@ us@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ he @-@ years can go on it and all have a great time .
if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it .
on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card .
in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this in order to buy something about the counter .
this not only leads to a slow@@ down of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no need is needed .
the poor woman in the department store was dis@@ ap@@ pointing , while I was tired of experiencing my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit .
last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell .
on account of murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girl@@ friend for a night@@ time intru@@ der that hid in the cabin .
the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that she is too transparent .
the National Criminal Court said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger of his sentence being increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the tet@@ ras from F@@ athers and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were dis@@ missed in the holidays and in the secondary schools .
three of the school students will go to the secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school .
on Tuesday evening school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
as a symbol of the dis@@ miss@@ al , the 29 pupils of the four classes chose a young eagle under the direction of Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , the m@@ lower band performed a musical titled &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the Chi@@ cken Farm &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
farmer Arnold found a strange egg and let it breed from his chi@@ ckens .
instead of a chi@@ ckens , a small eagle came out .
but the hope of making a chicken from him was broken ; the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain , and s@@ wore .
after that the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
the h@@ ens d@@ anced with the young goat who wore cylinders to bet .
the Eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ lei@@ derer Angel@@ ika S@@ itte .
the kit@@ ten may be different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it .
but he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every four @-@ year @-@ old man to feel accepted in his new school .
there followed thank@@ fulness to the colleagues , the former school director Michael Müller , who always jumps back to teaching pas@@ sports , and the parents &quot; representatives .
now the cooking time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher said .
after two years of teaching , she only dis@@ missed lessons because it was a really great time .
finally , they were able to rely on the four @-@ star drivers .
finally , all students were able to sing a song of summer time and holiday time .
at the same time , great joy broke out among the children .
eight first employees have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
two Bulg@@ arians were det@@ ained for illegal camps in Greece , distributed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by TV .
on the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal camp people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulg@@ arians .
on the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were released later .
the Greek authorities have ag@@ grav@@ ated control of the free camp and place everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , significant fin@@ es .
the controls will continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people have to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars .
they are intended to improve emissions behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the obligatory updates previously only apply to the vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the German Federal Authority ( KBA ) ordered their retro@@ fit .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
the manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet been called an exact date .
Daimler has announced to write to everyone concerned .
if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the framework .
how long will the conver@@ sions take place altogether ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin .
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act on the subject of the environment so far . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the conversion could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
what do mot@@ ori@@ sts who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?
the ACE advises to wait .
presumably foreign manufacturers would follow , such as S@@ met@@ anin .
is there a massive price deterioration of Euro @-@ 4 cars now ?
the ACE fears that .
but in the regions where road b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
in rural areas so far , there is no loss of value for older diesel .
the ACE reveals to be still waiting for sale .
ll Cool J Rec@@ ei@@ ves Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first prize @-@ giving ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the choreograph@@ er Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) .
the awards will be presented at the beginning of December .
traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will hold a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony .
this is why the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series has already announced to refra@@ in from participating in the gala .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; New York Times &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this pres@@ idency has decided to completely negl@@ ect the arts and human rights - even to ev@@ ade them - and that bur@@ dens me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an stressed that she will use Tr@@ ump to make her view clear .
the Kennedy Center , named after the former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .
former prize winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing .
we make the city worth living
Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes into retirement next year .
the place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare .
W@@ acker has been a municipal building master for 31 years .
and the work still makes him great fun as he conve@@ ys in the press conference .
he reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .
at the same time , it is surprised that so far no application can fulfil the requirements profile .
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
this is to be enough time for famili@@ arization with adher@@ ence to regular periods of notice .
since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as a Lower Building Law Authority , the applicant must present appropriate conclusions .
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
if it could no longer be fulfilled , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation .
but the clos@@ eness of the city is important to the city and itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as good atmosphere between authorities and citizens .
in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is sure about the construction office and its employees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen park area are around .
the Kin@@ zig@@ brücke between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stage restoration is still subject to issue .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the latter alone will strike with some 1.5 million euros , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker under@@ estimates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work here is fun . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
design is available for a city architect of great scope .
with Has@@ la@@ k &apos;s own yard and garden nur@@ sery , many can react flexibly to many .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what rein@@ forces &quot; when new buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the out@@ going city building master .
the Mayor has a high degree of responsibility anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is builder , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the end it &apos;s all about my table here . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the event of care and coordination , he can count on many years of work : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been there for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; W@@ acker wishes also that his successor remains long , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

bicycle on lea@@ der@@ board thrown : South railway closed
according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike off the rail@@ road crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines .
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpet@@ rators and are looking for them since the night .
near the scene , a pink sco@@ oter and a bike rider were observed by witnesses .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes far beyond a mountain range , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the perpet@@ rators brought themselves in great danger and endangered the traffic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay and the costs of rail @-@ making traffic , the pat@@ rons of the railway customers could also come to the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; substantial &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; amount is to be assumed , the speaker said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the south railway line could be led without hin@@ dran@@ ce .
just under ten people were dropped out on Friday morning , two of which were related to the traffic .
freight trains did not fall off , but they had delay .
according to Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help relieve IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study suggests exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases .
the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diarr@@ ho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .
while the person affected is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han protein helps to develop immune cells that promote a toler@@ ant gut .
the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body .
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
in experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promotes immunity in mice carrying a certain bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els .
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their diet , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han encourages more toler@@ ant , less flamm@@ able intestinal micro@@ lie@@ us when the same system is also used in humans .
the post @-@ doctoral candidate Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but a different group of the same stem , which was separately accommod@@ ated , did not have this .
she assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract .
the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced by DNA and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice .
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they got the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells .
in order to understand how the bacteria spread to the immune system , the researchers left L. reu@@ ter@@ i in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from the mice .
the immune cells developed to the toler@@ ant cells .
when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid .
if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in mice &apos;s feed , the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half .
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that humans have the same toler@@ ant @-@ promoting cells as mice and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han secondary products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in humans with inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes Manchester United has committed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius &quot; , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid @-@ field player had his debut at S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening .
the 40 million Po@@ und signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressed the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will .
however , the blues had been excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and only made 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .
&quot; he needs time but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; M@@ our@@ in@@ ho said .
&quot; we will help him to be ready sooner than later . &quot;
in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va stadium when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho started his launch XI for the beginning of the season .
the Independent disclosed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new obligations , but he insist@@ ed that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four prime new obligations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
the pilots flew off Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , which are several thousand kilometers .
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens , the shape of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so the number &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
new proposal for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem
as the wind turns : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , S &amp; D Prime Minister still looked for Berlin with a certain concern .
only no fire @-@ fires from the party centre , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation - was the most important wish of the election champ@@ ions .
since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .
since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus have been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals .
what Mr Schulz had received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described with a head@@ wind .
there were depth stops .
and one after the other .
after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against coalition of SPD and Gre@@ ens .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can simply not reliably go@@ vern , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U General Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the surprising fac@@ tional exit of a Gre@@ ens de@@ pu@@ ties has thrown down the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green President Michael Kell@@ ner asked El@@ ke T@@ ests to give back their mandate to the belli@@ ger@@ ent Dutch Green Party member El@@ ke T@@ ests .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the will of voters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; El@@ ke T@@ ests must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election campaign manager of the Gre@@ ens to the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must not be true , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a SPD election champion sigh@@ s when the new hi@@ bit message reaches the party centre on Friday morning . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Stephan Wei@@ l , the Prime Minister of the SPD of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority after the resig@@ nation of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ life@@ jackets .
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the misery started with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .
a blue eye , no more , the comrades calm down at that time .
after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different .
it became that - and everything became much worse .
the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the do@@ ve , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te cut the party smoothly .
the comrades turned back lab@@ ori@@ ously in the weeks after that .
then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came .
and the next depth came with him .
mayor Ola@@ f Sch@@ olz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his Nim@@ bus this weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning .
and because he did everything wrong in crisis communication , what you can do wrong .
since then , Sch@@ olz has been fighting for its political survival .
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW @-@ Ex@@ hau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been critic@@ ised for some time .
mi@@ ese survey values were added .
nevertheless , or perhaps because of that , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the federal government over the past few weeks .
the efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand its power in Berlin were not hidden even in the context of Martin Schulz .
they let him grant him , as they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
in doing so , Wei@@ l meets the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens in essence .
and Schulz is not at all .
for the time being , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .
their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and here above all on the apost@@ ate parliam@@ ent@@ arians in v@@ ests .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Ms T@@ ests puts their own car@@ eers on the interests of all others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German Editorial Network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ms. T@@ wo@@ ken has not been elected as a direct candidate , but on the provincial list of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens , so that the lower @-@ Saxon parliam@@ ent@@ arians continued .
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compl@@ ains an &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the voters &apos; willingness four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who heads the SPD in Lower Saxony as the top candidate in the parliamentary elections &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the R@@ ND . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U member dec@@ ei@@ ves the election result , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he asked to clarify the background .
I want to know if there has been more or further commitments from the CD@@ U Lower Saxony have been given .
funding program for local nucle@@ us III
who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years can soon get support from the country .
furthermore , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives of St@@ eg City Development informed them on Wednesday .
at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler once again gave a review of what happened to date .
since 1991 , there have been remedi@@ ation areas in sens@@ ations .
back then , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land Baden @-@ Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount .
in the refur@@ bish@@ ment area II between 2005 and 2016 , the grant was still 60 percent .
for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the present renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important , after all , to promote internal development and not only to open up new areas of construction .
on April 4 , the Board of Directors of the Government of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .
the total sum amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euro would come from the country , the rest of the municipality &apos;s feelings .
how does a remedi@@ ation area develop ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; you will , as Sch@@ in@@ dler on , investigate where the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it also plays a role if interest in the planned area is at all interested in rehabil@@ it@@ ating .
if necessary , the area boundaries could be postpon@@ ed again .
on Wednesday evening , the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Keller presented the contents of the Bund @-@ Länder @-@ Programme &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social City &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; in which frames would then be carried out . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the core of the programme is the revit@@ alization of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure .
the measures would be carried out obj@@ ectively , that is , per plot .
the remedi@@ ation area would then finally be established as a statute .
the approval period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
until September of this year , however , the inventory takes place only once , within the scope of which the participants in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire .
in November or December , the sentence is to be carried out as soon as possible , so that the restoration can begin next year .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .
it is about the evaluation of the urban planning gri@@ ev@@ ances and decide when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent .
there will also be a re@@ mark in the land register for the respective property .
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will again come to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised .
Got@@ zel emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants .
therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; building and plot el@@ bow &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which , among other things , is about the construction and renovation views . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; household and flat sheets &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; data on the size , division and inhabitants of a living room can be made . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the blue &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Work@@ sheet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be filled if business premises are operated in the building . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it should be noted that Got@@ z pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding .
in addition , new building measures are not eligible .
Sch@@ in@@ dler said that the distribution of the funds according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; function - who first comes , first ad@@ mon@@ ishes first .
you cannot reserve funds for later .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to conclude , photos of the project &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Loc@@ us II &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a refur@@ bish@@ ment &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
British invent@@ or sets himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
a British invent@@ or is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .
Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q .
he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an an@@ aes@@ thes@@ ist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock .
the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which starts when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ er thousands
the White House &apos;s decision to fly a na@@ vy helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military &apos;s information left to the TI@@ ME Magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars .
the Green @-@ White S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs .
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries .
the helicopter , manufactured in Connec@@ tic@@ ut , was issued next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or cargo , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event to his supervis@@ or , the deputy commander of the aviation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3@@ pm , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .
the note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for return flight .
the original crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane .
recordings made available from the TI@@ ME did not clearly show whether a second crew was ultimately required .
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the command@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it sounds as if you &apos;re locked &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the deputy commander replied . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the event &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and was not covered by the H@@ atch Act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but even official events have political over@@ tones .
at the event , the President gave an impet@@ us to reform the reform of the health reform , which was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations .
the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the trip .
but to request their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
Tr@@ ump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential jet was in front of the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set the U.S. president in the White House with precise cen@@ timeter records .
when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House led 58 training sessions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; event was part of the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a civil servant . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; helicopter units flew in addition 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; non @-@ presidential &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; missions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pay@@ ers over@@ took the burden of none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said the company had not been involved to exhibit the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget labels for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .
according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per hour .
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funding . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .
at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ tic@@ ut are very proud that they contribute to our national security and I assume that hundreds if not thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is of course appropriate to highlight that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man car .
in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tri@@ cky task
the leading runner of the Second Tennis League will join the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
TC Blue @-@ White Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel at the third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the leader of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality .
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent anyway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; especially on the rear positions I find the team very good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
imports from the high North are above all ensured for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer SV .
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to bet@@ s in the Davis Cup .
and they are also strong in dou@@ bles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be hard for us . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you also need good luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .

how America can hurt O@@ MV
indeed , Donald Tr@@ ump did not work when he put his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tigh@@ ten sanctions against Russia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Congress packed a few &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he estimated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Moscow reaction was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US impet@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after all , the draft aims to punish European companies that help Russians build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , investors in the local O@@ MV , together with other European companies , are involved in the construction of the Russian Eastern pastoral ministry North Stream 2 .
the Dro@@ h@@ kuli@@ sse is enormous .
however , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil corporation .
in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to resur@@ rec@@ t even the sanctions by executive order to life .
twelve arms are available to him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the press &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; looked at what the Group could ward off and which could really hurt him . &quot; &quot; &quot;

role backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organis@@ es the ita @-@ lunch menu again .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the urban nur@@ series .
on September 1st the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban nur@@ series ( Kit@@ as ) again in its own reg@@ ent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were all very happy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
cooked is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies freshly cooked cooled .
in Kre@@ feld , the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch@@ time .
in the past kit@@ ten year 28@@ 00 children were sitting at the tables , and the demand is growing steadily .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are served 45 week@@ days , in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita for lunch &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children remain until 14 o &apos;clock . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
46 part @-@ time workers have a kitchen service from the 1st of September : they heat the delivered food , supplement them with salad , raw vegetables and fruit , divide the meal individually , give the food off , clean up , clean and clean the kitchen .
&quot; the employees are assigned to a k@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz .
the size - there are two @-@ group as well as seven @-@ group facilities - decides on the timet@@ able .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the kitchen assist@@ ants now belong to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the kit@@ ing to implement educational concepts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about healthy eating and cooking classes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the children should help prepare the food . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the direct connection of the kitchen staff to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita spaces - up to now also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning personnel in the future .
this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it has turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison of the city as the most economical , it reads from the press office .
and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are newly set .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but these hours are not so heavy with about 750 people in the education area , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on women &apos;s political role , says the UN
elections can only be representative if all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .
Nicholas Hay@@ som , UN Secretary of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will be en@@ forced in the coun@@ ties in the provinces . three women candidates for the role of vice @-@ pres@@ idents and more than 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
elections can only be really representative and credi@@ ble if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the choice process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
the Tali@@ ban has published threats against a choice process that coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
this year elections for the first time will be transferred peac@@ efully from a demo@@ crati@@ cally elected government to the next .
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will rein@@ force the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afgh@@ an independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women of a total registered 3.6 million voters are registered .

G@@ MB concern about investment in Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glas@@ gow
a trade union would like to make sure that the long @-@ term commitment to production in its plant in Glas@@ gow is necessary for managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; G@@ MB Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than 500 employees work in the factory , which , alongside other products , produces hob@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he has invested over 5 million pounds in recent years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the first if their activities would change . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a letter to the company &apos;s manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s insist@@ ed on expressing concerns that financing for the moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ Organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity on business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from the general @-@ site manager is deeply involved in our members .
generations of families have worked here and the workforce concentr@@ ates strongly on the local community and the Greater Glas@@ gow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .
hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glas@@ gow urgently requires a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ woman for Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the manager of T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continued commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed .
we discussed with employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly check our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - to remain competitive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past few years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we realise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility . should our operations change at the location , the employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after she has left an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the world record ?
the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp , with Paul Pog@@ ba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds .
after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week .
Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way out , although a source near the Catal@@ ans Board insist@@ ed that the club always gave his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 .
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
when Manchester City was interested in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer .
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of her price deals for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter revers@@ ed and damaged
in the night from Friday to Saturday , an unknown perpet@@ r@@ ator has intentionally dropped a sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ feld street in front of the estate number 30 , and thus caused damage to the vehicle &apos;s disgu@@ ise of more than 200 Euro .
the police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , telephone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for information .
the police witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
because a car met him on his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and touched the control line .
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um was on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction to Le@@ ese on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him on his lane , so he had to go to the right .
the Tour@@ an driver touched the Leit@@ plan@@ ke .
damage to the car was done by car .
the driver of the passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident .
according to the accident report , it may be good that the motor@@ cycli@@ st had not noticed the accident at all .
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the cause of judgment to contact the comm@@ iss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au , Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication against the German press agency , he obtained an ap@@ ology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present @-@ day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as by the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year old brother of Pope Bene@@ dict XVI .
it would serve the pres@@ tige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ is@@ sions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Vatican paper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that during the reporting on violence in the dom@@ es with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; double standards &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
with regard to the attacks in Regensburg , nobody doubt that it is &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , con@@ spic@@ uous is the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; said the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a fixed fres@@ nel . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a normal educational remedy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to deal with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed .
in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared .
&quot; &quot; &quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
what exactly stands in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; a total of 5@@ 47 earth@@ en@@ ware dom@@ es were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; victims of assault , 67 dom@@ es . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the final report it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence .
especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more fierce .
nevertheless , unlike many other accused , many victims under@@ estimated that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and that in many cases , despite violence , they even associate positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ pages report on the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ ci@@ dents of Viol@@ ence Exer@@ cise at Prot@@ ective Recommen@@ ded at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gives a contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for one , many pupils highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot;
on the other hand , it also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became tangible to the econom@@ ist when a dom@@ es musi@@ cally did not produce top performance .
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ograph@@ er ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger appears at all in it .
he is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of activity .
one can pre@@ tend it at best , learn from it too late or have taken first indications seriously enough .
the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , where he worked , was felt by practically all respon@@ dents as &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot;
the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also presents an excellent testimony as &quot; warm @-@ hear@@ ted , &quot; &quot; popular , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and cand@@ y and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot;
only a minority is compl@@ aining about its perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also once led to ab@@ ut@@ qu@@ arri@@ es .
the fact that he didn &apos;t just kne@@ el with chairs and threw the key ring on the floor , but also gave ear fig@@ s and pulled too nau@@ gh@@ ty boys to the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regre@@ ts and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it .
to his salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able period , in the 1960s and 1970s , with parents such as with teachers .
do you also know such breeding methods ?
of course , I think each one of us who was born before 1968 .
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um .
compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the ex@@ hor@@ r@@ ence of violence at the pre @-@ school , these are certainly bag@@ at@@ ellen .
one wonders whether it is not with his fame and his role as a brother of Bene@@ dict XVI that many media have just crashed on him .
many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently at the Bavarian Pope .
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
in the media , in connection with the report , there was a lot about the topic of mis@@ use in the Regensburg domain spar@@ rows .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also subjected to any involvement or co @-@ acquain@@ tance with regard to sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault has claimed to be entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were consecrated .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or mother , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said an affected person on behalf of others , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the real problem with clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was and is , however , that most victims are silent .
if they didn &apos;t even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators .
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen School students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student formulated it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
I think it ... even for really absurd , to assume that ... Bu@@ bs have opened intru@@ sive or clearer or even more than against their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , trust@@ worthy teachers , etc .
that one talks to him about sex ... un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fact that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is free to speak of any co @-@ knowing .
so he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad .
therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these illegal crimes , as it unfortunately happened in some cases .
in the media a lot of &quot; non @-@ violence &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Look at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge che@@ ek out of sexual abuse and rob@@ ber@@ y and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
but this is exactly the case of mis@@ use of the report .
since it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the secondary school of the cathedral @-@ cats , between sexual abuse and non@@ violence as well as , let &apos;s say , other accus@@ ations .
in addition , the report treats incidents from the period since 1945 , so also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the cathedral @-@ cats .
the whole horri@@ ble test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were wron@@ g@@ ly cro@@ oked and mal@@ ol@@ oured and suffering from them , all took place at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where there really had to be sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions .
but with those Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys on his face when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um .
on the one hand , as most witnesses emphasize , the topic of &quot; pre @-@ school &quot; tab@@ oo .
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; conditions .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and this is also true for Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many victims rated the Universal Human@@ ity of R. &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; and that is why in many cases , despite violence , they even associate positive memories with him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to be looked away .
but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school .
the first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .
does Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently shut the ears in front of the states ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ litter @-@ gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report even reproduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this he points out that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the trial will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
even in the face of the danger of negative press release , he advised urgent intervention .
that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pun@@ ish@@ ments were banned in Bavaria too long ago .
before that , they took place in a j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal grey area , as each of us knows .
it was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded .
but one can &apos;t say that he always looked away .
this is just not true .
only in 1980 , the test was officially aboli@@ shed at schools in Bavaria .
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Tax@@ is asser@@ ted that it was unfair to apply the current pedago@@ gical standards at that time .
how do you see this ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we histori@@ ans talk about the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Fall@@ stri@@ ck of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that is , the danger to evaluate the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the princess is right there .
but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ red at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence to innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time .
that &apos;s all very horri@@ ble and I &apos;m glad that it is finally worked out .
but at the same time I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him .
his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , so cat@@ tery and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .
when physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly in mind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what image of his time in Regensburg has been shown by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the discussions with you for the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
did the subject of test appeal also speak to the language ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , from his perspective , the cathedral @-@ cats only played a minor role .
nevertheless , I do not at all conc@@ eal that he led a strict regim@@ ent there .
but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without asking for un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ scen@@ dence , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .
with bis@@ cuits and can@@ dies alone , one does not even make a big singer and before every success , regardless of the area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming .
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the discussions with her book ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as wonderful , humor@@ ous , basic , deep @-@ believing and hear@@ ty people , of which you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do a fly .
I regularly receive regular contact with him , like many former dom@@ es still today , 23 years after his exp@@ ir@@ ation , visit him , read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .
those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority .
today most of the dom@@ es are thank@@ ful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look up and which they almost glori@@ fy .
and please , again clearly : everything you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda back then .
we can be happy that we have long been overcome this time .
but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
the evil intent behind it is only too obvious .
for the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves it .
now the starting point would be a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody knows the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace .
