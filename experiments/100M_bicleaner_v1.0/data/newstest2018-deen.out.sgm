<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt, where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners cultivate the rusty ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows this, who already had to be upset because the Auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">The historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but especially very informative.</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a flickering carpet that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">For cities and communities more detailed maps, so-called original position sheets, were incorporated into the large overview map.</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and arose from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French army captain occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">Even if the French troops finally withdrew the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: it was the present neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern map.</seg>
<seg id="18">Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the "Topographic Bureau" - and thus the Bavarian surveying management.</seg>
<seg id="19">The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of the former / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">An example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">Sendling was registered 21 years after the map was created, i.e. 1877, in the district of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="24">Today Untersendling is located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">The houses Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser until 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705.</seg>
<seg id="26">Where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces from the so-called "original" from which the base tax was derived.</seg>
<seg id="27">Today, small plots show no more farmers - but farmers of the plant "Land in the Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">The Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete desert.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "in the area of the present district au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "" "at the Gasteig" "" "or from the hill" "" "Auf der Lüften" "" "- but also in large letters" "" "Irren Anstalt" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked up people with delusions.</seg>
<seg id="33">It was there in 1858 / 59 that the Munich district Irrenamt "Auf der Auer Lüften" was created.</seg>
<seg id="34">From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - that psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "" "" "he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the appeal of the so-called" "" "Irish" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">He also forbidden the personnel to use violence against the occupants, "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen Museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution.</seg>
<seg id="37">There was first room for 280 patients, later it was extended to 500 places.</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">Since 2006 there has been the Isar-Amper-Klinikum in Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists.</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich Salesianum are now meeting in the area of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">West lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East, east of residential houses from the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="43">"" "in 2015, the children" "" "Casa Don Bosco" "" "was built in an architectural style based on the original construction of the Irrenamt, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bomb attacks." ""</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was named "Main Square" around 1856, the Kaufinger Street was called "Kaufinger Gasse."</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies torn many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">The English institute, small business houses and a chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof, where these days are the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the groundbreaking ceremony for the second suburban railway line will take place.</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider the old Munich map can be compared with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for the Promotion of Fares has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racial attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, invites afro-american travelers, visitors and Missouri to take special attention when travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial incidents occur in recent times throughout the state."</seg>
<seg id="53">A recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to win discrimination, as well as the enforcement agencies of the state, which disproportionately focus on minorities, prompted the group to release the warning message, the NAACP said.</seg>
<seg id="54">"" "" "" "they have violations of civil rights that happen to people." ""</seg>
<seg id="55">They are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed, "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star.</seg>
<seg id="56">"" "" "" "we hear complaints in such a frequency which we have not yet heard." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">The group quoted incidents like racist violation of black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee.</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was taken custody by the Missouri police without being accused of being guilty.</seg>
<seg id="60">The Council also refers to a recent report by Missouri, a recent report by Missouri, which shows that black motorists in the state will be raised 75 percent more frequently than white.</seg>
<seg id="61">"" "" "" "the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees what could happen in Missouri," "" "said Chapel." ""</seg>
<seg id="62">"" "" "" "people must be willing to bring their deposit money or let relatives know that they travel through the state." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime reporting program of the FBI, which classifies the state with respect to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">Prior to that, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona since the states adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial benefit.</seg>
<seg id="66">Warning warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately interest groups have used the measure as a reaction to certain laws and trends within the United States.</seg>
<seg id="67">Crossover project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Weidezaun project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The members of the CDU Parliamentary Assembly Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-local association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the right-graving court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his operations, in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many kittens provided and accommodated in five apartments.</seg>
<seg id="72">"" "the" "" "Schwarzwaldmilch" "" "is for him the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="73">At the table of the Feriengaeste only Regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"" "since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the soft-down project as" "" "elementary important." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit in such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">The green area care for a lot of work, a lot must be dealt with with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"" "" "" "we have here with the conditions and with the topography to fight," "" "emphasized Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003, he took over the parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer, even if it does not lead bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" "" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the fence project and is glad about the leader support." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="80">At the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported.</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope that the afforestation of the surfaces could be drafted for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"" "" "" "the greatest treasure we have is the people working in agriculture and thinking about how they continue their operations," "" "said the mayor." ""</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">A total of 25 plots were encapsulated by eleven participants in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="85">The open maintenance area is thus 40 hectares, which must not be afforested to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">Of the total costs of 71 500 euros, half was promoted via leader, a quarter carried the municipality of Fischbach.</seg>
<seg id="87">Thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of electric fence.</seg>
<seg id="88">"" "" "" "the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," "" "explained Schwendemann." ""</seg>
<seg id="89">"" "Kordula Kovac stressed:" "" "you do a really good job, without farmers and countrywomen." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="90">"" "also for Peter Weiß asserted:" "" "best foods are produced here." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Regional Direction Directive (LPR) Baden-Württemberg makes it possible to promote the state advancement of wheat-lagoons.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the secrecy of the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The prerequisite is the presence of a transfer rate marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "" "" "in addition, the fenced area must not be economically viable (slope of over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation." ""</seg>
<seg id="95">The proposal of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the Weidezhort project 2018.</seg>
<seg id="96">The open maintenance area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112,000 euros.</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump Regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to restrict legal migration to the Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="102">To stay fair, Miller didn't handle the statue himself.</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have ynted him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">But he picked up its significance, and in particular the importance which it was attributed to when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base.</seg>
<seg id="105">"" "when Miller proclaimed Acosta," "" "I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world." ""</seg>
<seg id="106">"" "the poem on which you refer, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="107">Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it's not really about history.</seg>
<seg id="108">It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor: "your idleness, your poor, / your oppressed masses, who yearn to breathe freely, / the eleventh apostasy of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">"" "there was never a time when the" "" "eleventh waste" "" "on our screens was better visible." ""</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict, because of the importance of a statue, is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who used to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they took up a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was supposed to show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="118">The great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invade anyone, but rather an early neoconservative that puts the American flame into the surrounding world: "Lady Liberty is moving forward.</seg>
<seg id="119">She is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">"" "the torch is not supposed to illuminate the way to the United States." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh has encountered something quite unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the viewpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see her as seen by the exhausted, elemental, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships.</seg>
<seg id="124">It is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives.</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">And this of course is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge.</seg>
<seg id="127">Her torch is not to illuminate the way, but ignite the hatred that is its only source of power.</seg>

<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant. "</seg>
<seg id="139">Several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butovo, who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m line while Eilidh Doyle is elected team captain.</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "" "" "Eilidh is quite modest." ""</seg>
<seg id="141">Their Captain's speech was incredible, "says Black.</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated.</seg>
<seg id="143">"" "the passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought back naturally were great." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="144">The Commonwealth Silver Medal winner, who will compete for the 400 m hurdles in their fifth world championships, says it's "incredible" that 16 Scotts are in the British squad.</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir leads along this road and last year has set up five British and two European records.</seg>

<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">The team captain says that they are "hugely proud" of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases also participate in the medals and the finals.</seg>
<seg id="151">"being so special about being a team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honor anyway, but knowing that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me, makes it something special for me," she added.</seg>
<seg id="152">"" "" "" "obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team." ""</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we have come.</seg>

<seg id="155">As to my speech as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">Yes, I think she went well.</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>

<seg id="160">Block Critics on Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the local voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">The Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers hit him for everything, from domestic politics to his political principles.</seg>
<seg id="163">He dabbled in criticism, certainly.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"" "for in 1783, Washington said:" "" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more than Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union lamented him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">The governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with "Na, and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," said many people.</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to make his hair loose head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">Hence the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side - which is a public forum that is officially designated and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation.</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the whip online.</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur, and a priest, no trolls.</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hateful but she asked for hate crimes.</seg>
<seg id="186">"" "" "" "I commented courteously that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other recent news," "" "she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast" "" "The Post." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"" "" "" "I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are rather disregarded by some rather than a so called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="188">"" "what the governor's employees referred to as a" "" "concentrated spam attack" "" "would probably call" "" "intercession" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in earlier times when one has done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical corpses and to arrest and silence demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this issue fell in Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County shed the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she banned a voter from her Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">That shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">At the time of Washington, the time of affordable porting had a similar effect as the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="199">The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters beat on his lead.</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then, Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">The people who used pseudonyms like "Juricola," "Belisarius," "Belisarius" and "Portius," wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions.</seg>
<seg id="202">Petitions which criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and shipping with Great Britain were overwhelmed by the historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project.</seg>

<seg id="272">In 2015 alone, Freeport has reduced its worth of $3.1 billion in gold and copper.</seg>
<seg id="273">In addition, Papua has wooden resources valued at estimated 78 billion US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="274">These assets, however, are a source of misery for the Papua, ensuring that Indonesia's powerful military maintains a suffocating presence.</seg>
<seg id="275">An investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004, including up to $150,000 in a single officer.</seg>

<seg id="349">Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya.</seg>
<seg id="350">In response to this, thousands of people in Paniai were arrested and arbitrarily arrested in custody under the pretext of "safeguarding national sovereignty."</seg>

<seg id="408">Less than 1 percent claimed that they were belatedly discovered that they had been mistaken for firearms, ammunition or explosives.</seg>
<seg id="409">The survey of more than 1,000 people - the one of a jet charter service, the Stratos Jet Charters Inc., was conducted - also noted that younger travelers rather disregard the rules.</seg>
<seg id="410">Of the respondents admitted that they knowingly tried to fly with something that was banned by the TSA, 19.7 percent of millennials were compared to less than 15 percent, who were members of Generation X.</seg>
<seg id="411">The most common items that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">More than 3 per cent reported to have knowingly carried items with blades through security control, while 2.2 percent of female interviewees and 3.7 percent of the male interviewees also confirmed that they had deliberately brought illegal drugs into the aircraft.</seg>
<seg id="413">The company said it was asking travelers all over the country to find out how many accidentally had smuggled goods by airport security and how many had deliberately done it.</seg>
<seg id="414">It is no surprise that the people who are most likely smuggling - knowingly or unknowingly - carry on security, those who fly most often.</seg>

<seg id="421">Electro-Tausendsassa Elon Musk likes to give up with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla "Model 3."</seg>
<seg id="422">In doing so, he has so far underlined that a part of the customer has already withdrawn its non-binding reservation.</seg>
<seg id="423">In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different, less glorious number when the recent quarterly balance has been announced: the cancellations made at the new mass market model 3.</seg>
<seg id="424">In recent months, Musk frequently had advertised more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery just begins.</seg>
<seg id="425">Now Musk admits: 63,000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 pre-orders.</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">In case of cancellation, Tesla will pay the 1000 Euro (in the United States 1000 US dollars and in Great Britain 1000 Pounds) "reservation payment."</seg>
<seg id="428">At present 45,000 such non-binding reservations are available, in a telephone conference with analysts.</seg>
<seg id="429">However, the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem.</seg>
<seg id="430">His argument: the challenge for ambitious growth targets lies not in demand but on the production side.</seg>
<seg id="431">Last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="432">In 2018, all models will be taken together - $500,000, a million by 2020.</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">According to Musk there are 1800 reservations per day.</seg>
<seg id="435">Anyone who orders a Model 3 today may anticipate delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new, never-tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization in practice.</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">But if it comes to larger delays, the unbinding effect of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="438">Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running in flocks.</seg>

<seg id="441">Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of government environmental authorities than previous administrations.</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is a deadline that went on 1 October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for down-to-earth ozone.</seg>
<seg id="444">"" "Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance for one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid" "" "interfere in local decisions or impede economic growth." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="445">Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental regulations for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="446">Since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulation, which resists the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels.</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prudential regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">Last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he attempted to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage.</seg>
<seg id="449">In a statement published on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal in ozone standards simply reinforces the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with States through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards.</seg>
<seg id="450">"" "" "" "under previous administrations, EPA has often not adhered to deadlines for performing and then waiting to be accused of activists and others, and in an agreement to set the date for implementation," "" "said Pruitt, who accused the EPO more than a dozen times in his previous job."

<seg id="454">The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive acquisition of the ozone rules.</seg>
<seg id="455">A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years.</seg>
<seg id="456">The measure was not yet set up in the Senate.</seg>

<seg id="466">750 years of St. Hilarius' Church: on the occasion of the Jubilee of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumgen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, July 16, at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="467">Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay.</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made the friends and promoters of Tumlingens their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">"" "Walter Martini stresses:" "" "it is a unique village jewel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="471">In 1267 St. Hilariuskapelle (St. Hilariuskapelle) was first mentioned in the Württemberg urn book: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumarc including the Vogtei "at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver.</seg>
<seg id="472">According to the wording of the certificate, apart from the former parish church, there was also a magnificent courtyard where the church or the patronage belonged to and not vice versa.</seg>
<seg id="473">There were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">As seen from the description of the municipality of Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the village and the upper village, which are still visible in the townscape of Tumbling, the "mountain" of the third, the most magnificent settlement centre of the village.</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 confirm these historical conditions.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage originated from the early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">A master who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church and could also inherit the church.</seg>
<seg id="478">Thus, the right to use a pastor or propose a new pastor to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The Greens of the two crumble at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">The newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but had to be handed over later in the Second World War in 1942.</seg>
<seg id="482">In the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the windows were hammered and the belfry were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops encamped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and the church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">Until 1869 the Tumgen Hilarius cemetery served as the final resting place for the Dead from Hörschweiler.</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the church of Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve 1834, a storm split the steeple and half fell.</seg>
<seg id="491">To prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished.</seg>

<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette no wind turbines could have been approved because at the time in Viersen only at the border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind power concentration zone.</seg>
<seg id="509">Within this concentration zone, the construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city.</seg>

<seg id="521">Last year, the company, in which the town of Viersen is indirectly involved, has closed lease agreements with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of land.</seg>
<seg id="522">With the construction of four wind turbines, the electricity needs of some 11 400 households should be covered - this is equivalent to about one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households.</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer, Viersen's City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Windpark Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in Übach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district.</seg>

<seg id="664">The stage (designed by Aleksandar DENIC) shows either a foamed street corner with wall rest and Dönerbude in Berlin, a "Plaste and Elaste" logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange.</seg>
<seg id="665">Before that, an open Mercedes classic car park, in which the Rheinkillers pose as rock ergirls, or alternatively a Isetta.</seg>
<seg id="666">Stacked oil barrels remember Castorfs Leitmotiv - money, power and greed - which runs through his "ring" production.</seg>
<seg id="667">The three Rheinkillers - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel, Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as in "Rheingold."</seg>
<seg id="668">They seduced Siegfried (Stefan Vinke), grind a corpse into the trunk in Hollywood-Manier and give the Krawallo-Clique.</seg>
<seg id="669">Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen that surrounds the aura of a heavyweight boxer.</seg>
<seg id="670">Brutal the scene when he smiled Siegfried.</seg>
<seg id="671">Later also Gunther (Markus oak) has to believe in it.</seg>
<seg id="672">The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause.</seg>
<seg id="673">Foster, Milling, Vinke and conductor Janowski, who modestly bows his hands to the Merkel-Raute, are celebrated stormy.</seg>
<seg id="674">There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra, which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the large heat back in casual casual wear.</seg>
<seg id="675">The show was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his team of staff.</seg>
<seg id="676">In 2013, in 2013, he had to give a glowing pipe concert about himself, there were five years later a great jubilation in which the occasional "Buh" reputations went down.</seg>

<seg id="680">I draw a positive résumé.</seg>
<seg id="681">Max quantity works as a volunteer</seg>
<seg id="682">They work in several places in their volunteer year.</seg>
<seg id="683">Where everywhere?</seg>
<seg id="684">Quantity: usually in stone belts at the furniture fair, once a week I will help here in Greven in the furniture bridge.</seg>
<seg id="685">And I also worked at school in an open day.</seg>
<seg id="686">What are your experiences with it?</seg>
<seg id="687">Quantity: it's a nice, wide spectrum that I see here.</seg>
<seg id="688">I have to do with different people, with young people, with refugees, with young adults.</seg>
<seg id="689">They are now 26 years, so a later-called volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="690">How does it come about?</seg>
<seg id="691">Amount: I graduated from high school.</seg>
<seg id="692">And then a civil engineer, let's say, successfully broken off.</seg>
<seg id="693">I realized for myself that it's the wrong thing and I want to do something different, work with people.</seg>
<seg id="694">And then I asked what are you doing.</seg>
<seg id="695">Make a social year, there is an insight, there you can see how it really is on site, at the focal point.</seg>
<seg id="696">And was it like that?</seg>
<seg id="697">Amount: I collected great impressions.</seg>
<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social system during the winter semester.</seg>
<seg id="699">I will study dual, probably in Jugendamt Herne a social worker education and study in Hamm at the University of Applied Sciences.</seg>
<seg id="700">Isn't it a bit unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service?</seg>
<seg id="701">Quantity: yes, it is very variable.</seg>
<seg id="702">It always depends on where you are going to be FSJ.</seg>
<seg id="703">It is possible to do it from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work.</seg>
<seg id="704">With me it was very varied.</seg>
<seg id="705">I was also partly in the OGS, so in the afternoon care.</seg>
<seg id="706">For me it was just the right thing that irritated me.</seg>
<seg id="707">I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out.</seg>
<seg id="708">In a different way than in civil engineering?</seg>
<seg id="709">Amount: well, here it's not about calculating statics.</seg>
<seg id="710">One repeatedely has other people in front of the head, each having a completely different story behind him.</seg>
<seg id="711">Whether a refugee, whether a young man, who has been taken out of the family - must always deal with it individually.</seg>
<seg id="712">Very interesting.</seg>
<seg id="713">And you had no reservations?</seg>
<seg id="714">Amount: I'm not the guy for that.</seg>
<seg id="715">It is an area that gives a lot.</seg>
<seg id="716">Lots of love, lots of kindness.</seg>
<seg id="717">There are also negative moments, but life is so.</seg>

<seg id="719">The British educational group Pearson said on Friday that she will dismantle further 3,000 jobs and cut its intermediate dividends by 72 percent, as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company faces.</seg>
<seg id="720">The job cuts, which General Director John Fallon announced mainly for the end of 2018 and the beginning of 2019, comes in addition to its previous restructuring, which has already lost 4,000 points.</seg>
<seg id="721">In May in a third cost-cutting programme, Pearson announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds (394 million US dollars) to revive a business which was hit by the fast pace of digital learning.</seg>

<seg id="731">Correspondents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group known as the so-called Islamic State (IS) in Qarabagh is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby area.</seg>
<seg id="732">According to the United Nations, there were at least 1,662 civilian casualties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017, about 20% in the capital.</seg>
<seg id="733">At the end of July, a suicide bombing killed at least 30 people in a mainly Shiite district of Kabul.</seg>
<seg id="734">The Taliban said they had carried out this attack.</seg>
<seg id="735">On 31 May, a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadliest militant attack in the country since the US-led troops forced the Taliban from power in 2001.</seg>
<seg id="736">Violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan, as U.S. President Donald Trump balances the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country.</seg>

<seg id="748">In the end, the decision was clear: in two counterparts, the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winner decides to set up a common room in the future retirement home.</seg>
<seg id="749">Before the discussion there is an important information: the purchase contract for the remaining part of the property is signed, reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden.</seg>

<seg id="904">The works on the three bridges of the Landstraße 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg are progressing well.</seg>

<seg id="908">The end of the building is scheduled for October and Leicht is sure that the schedule is complied with.</seg>
<seg id="909">The first bridge, coming from Schramberg, leads across the Trombach.</seg>
<seg id="910">It is a arch bridge made of concrete, which is covered with red Buntsandstein and has a total length of 4.80 metres.</seg>
<seg id="911">It was built in 1900.</seg>
<seg id="912">Like the other two bridges, it has now come into the years.</seg>
<seg id="913">In order to ensure stability and road safety, the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated.</seg>
<seg id="914">The other two bridges lead over Lauterbach.</seg>

<seg id="916">Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10,60 metres long respectively.</seg>
<seg id="917">The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tons weighted bridge cap on the northern side.</seg>
<seg id="918">This is a border fastener that is also used as operating mode.</seg>
<seg id="919">A 2.20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="920">Then the pedestrian walkway is to run.</seg>
<seg id="921">The special thing about it is that it is finished parts, a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo.</seg>
<seg id="922">The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges.</seg>
<seg id="923">Special fingertip feeling has required the laying of cables by the building in Lauterbach.</seg>
<seg id="924">Because there is also a fibre-optic cable, to which many companies are connected.</seg>
<seg id="925">The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work.</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the football rules of football affect Neymars move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules that aim to prevent unhindered issues of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">Any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA, as the executive organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohibit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament.</seg>
<seg id="1124">Financial fair play rules launched in 2011 by UEFA mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses.</seg>
<seg id="1125">Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million) to extract the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year.</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can certainly make the money loose, so that Neymar subscribes and brings him into a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the wealthy ruling family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">Associations are allowed to spend a lot of money for the purchase of players, but must be subject to legitimate income sources that allow them to reach the break-even point in their business-related business.</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">The former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdrew their support.</seg>
<seg id="1131">In 2011, FFP shifted from focusing on the debt of clubs to supervising their losses.</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model, which originally used the novel Abramovich in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder matter.</seg>
<seg id="1133">During the current three-year FFP period that runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to €30 million.</seg>
<seg id="1134">And although Platini has fallen from the presidency in 2015, his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to discourage her excessive expenditure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"" "" "" "surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely reinforce the rules for the future," "" "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP compared to The Associated Press in the past week." ""</seg>
<seg id="1136">Although PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract.</seg>
<seg id="1137">Neymar signed a five-year contract, so that the detachment rates for the next five years will be reported in the amount of 44.4 million euros in the annual financial statements.</seg>
<seg id="1138">The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014, the PSG combined with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, has hit the heaviest sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="1139">The PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which later was lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players.</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to override their financial supervision by inflating their revenue from companies that are associated with the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">While a catalyst company could sponsor PSG if the value of the sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not leave it as legitimate incomes.</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the sponsorship of the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments of the World Cup 2022 organizational committee in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar World Cup ambassador will be and such maneuver for the UEFA regulators could be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">"" "" "" "the sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be more attentive to take note of any attempt to circumvent the rules." ""</seg>
<seg id="1146">UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, announcing Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press, since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 generated a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year have to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">PSG expects Neymars's arrival a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and tricot sales.</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales after signing by at least 30 percent will rise.</seg>
<seg id="1152">The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and she tried to prevent Neymars away by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP.</seg>
<seg id="1153">"" "" "" "it is a clear case of" "" "financial doping" "" "with the club and the state," "" "said the president of the La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS regarding Qatar's last ownership to PSG." ""</seg>

<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and an embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories.</seg>

<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) still hasn't lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">And there is another crazy evil plot in which Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) is included, who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">As always, the expositions are the best part of the franchise.</seg>
<seg id="1196">It's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublippies of "singles," whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker.</seg>
<seg id="1197">It's the moments of accidental insanity that could heat up this franchise as a kind of repetitive "Seven Up!" series until he reaches that which I think as his logical conclusion: "wet Years Later" whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the film premiere of "Wet Hot American Summer."</seg>
<seg id="1198">"comrade Detective" on Amazon now remembers another kind of nostalgia: to revive the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-west-west-wrestling iconography.</seg>
<seg id="1199">The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka as director announces to be a found TV series: a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends, two officers from Bucharest, fighting for truth, atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The main roles - a hard-boiled Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu ulici, whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum (also an executive producer) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English.</seg>
<seg id="1201">It is an ingenious idea.</seg>

<seg id="1205">But "comrade Detective" is so much involved in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">There are six long episodes, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough.</seg>
<seg id="1207">"comrade Detective," who was re-edited on a smaller length could better deliver its agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a bunch of burgers.</seg>

<seg id="1317">Living the Great Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, resized in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment.</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived in a much larger room with my former in Knightsbridge," Joanne says.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"" "I fell in love with them and made an offer this day." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1324">Since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot size of the apartment was completely overhauled.</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Shelter and an mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light.</seg>
<seg id="1327">That was my requirement, "she says.</seg>
<seg id="1328">For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development, but also a place to life for Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1329">The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms over each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand.</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"" "" "" "we had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked over each other without having to bend." ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"" "it was not only about building a simple platform, but to attach the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with lots of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">Mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage style Mouille lighting set the style for the program.</seg>
<seg id="1337">The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light.</seg>
<seg id="1338">A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it seem longer.</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance there are mirrored units place for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">Through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used.</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">What is special about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"" "" "" "a bit of engineering art was going in," "" "explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door." ""</seg>
<seg id="1345">"" "" "" "it is so important that if you push the door up, it slips very easily." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1346">Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout.</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is valued," says Erfan.</seg>
<seg id="1348">"" "" "" "a real estate agent will enter into a vestigial form and perform a calculation based on the soil size." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1349">Here they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time to use high-quality materials which give the room its luxurious advantage.</seg>
<seg id="1350">"" "" "" "the materials are the things that you touch and that therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," "" "says Erfan." ""</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">These are important, but they do not play with your heart. "</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that a flat can transform itself through good design and an increased square meterome of something standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">In fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave them.</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>
<seg id="1356">Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a debate because of one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million.</seg>
<seg id="1357">The former director of the 'Carlton-Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul. he has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets should be divided.</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014, but a sharp conflict about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">Together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business at Smith Street, Collingwood.</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the Westco jeans family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">This money has been invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city center, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs.</seg>
<seg id="1363">After an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - written by Paul as "main operator and the dominant personality" in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third.</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court record states that this means that Colin owns property worth $316 million and has a value of 176 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a point of interest for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"" "" "" "the detachments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," "" "he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015." ""</seg>
<seg id="1367">Last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place.</seg>
<seg id="1368">The brothers now also struggle to control the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him.</seg>
<seg id="1369">Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetently.</seg>
<seg id="1370">In an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says, he hopes to settle the dispute.</seg>
<seg id="1371">"" "" "" "my Italian inheritance dictates that the family is the most important priority," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1372">The costs rise, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, among them Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms.</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who run milk bars and delicatessen shops from the late 1950 "s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies.</seg>
<seg id="1374">They took advantage of the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first denim of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he began West co there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a small child (about 10 years old)."</seg>
<seg id="1376">Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons.</seg>
<seg id="1377">"" "" "" "Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "" "she wrote." ""</seg>
<seg id="1378">Two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis group of companies, with Colin claiming that Mark has paid $10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1379">"" "both Luke and Mark are" "" "Paul" "" "has become bitter about the conditions of her financial separation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withheld himself very much, although he was a former AFL member of the board and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV stars.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"" "only Colin answered by SMS to say" "" "I really can't say much" "", "because the case is before the courts." ""</seg>
<seg id="1383">"" "" "" "it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to dress me and draw our surname through the courts," "" "he wrote." ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">Trumps appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the presidency's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others tried it and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">If so, he will be the first.</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more uniform course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with executive staff on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House that he wants to repair: poor information that came into the hands of the president.</seg>
<seg id="1395">"" "" "" "Kelly told the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys Diagnose makes sense, but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">President Trumps's relationship with television dates back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong.</seg>
<seg id="1398">"" "" "" "if candidate Trump was angry for unfair coverage, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of positions to convince," "" "said the former election campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico." ""</seg>
<seg id="1399">"" "Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" "" "the key to keep Trumps's Twitter habit under control, according to six former electoral campaigners there is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials are aware of something we do not know - that Trumps tweets would have included even more ignition material without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">If his employees managed to keep him away from him several times, their efforts have been worthwhile.</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently been able to prevent trump disputes.</seg>
<seg id="1406">Part of the problem is that people in a White House who are composed of competing parties will always try to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world.</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisors to bring dubious information to the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldsmith:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"" "" "" "current and former dump officials say that trump like a volcano can react to negative press clippings, especially those with damaged leaks, and to find out where they originate." ""</seg>
<seg id="1410">That happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be "the source behind a heap of leaks" in the White House.</seg>
<seg id="1411">Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for chicanes or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has voiced false accusations in the past and has revoked them.</seg>
<seg id="1412">"" "trump read the article and began asking people about Walsh." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1413">"" "Goldsmith added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," "" "tried to implement a system to manage and document the trump." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence.</seg>
<seg id="1417">These unchanging factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1418">Most sought-after criminals get post from Europol</seg>

<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">Because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the former Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014 approximately 30,000 overnights were lost per year and revenue from the tourist tax also went.</seg>
<seg id="1449">In autumn 2014, in view of the dramatic rise in numbers of refugees arriving in the administrative district, the hotel building was offered to the Landratsamt as a collection shelter.</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a planning plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt Lord Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties to the house.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenyi with Managing Director Birgit Scherer, based in Bad Bergzabern, has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof during a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return it to a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Representative places Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">In the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, special investigator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"" "the committee received the work in recent weeks, wrote the" "" "Wall Street Journal" "" "on appeal to people familiar with the matter." ""</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper took the step as a sign that Mueller expanded his investigation and intensified his investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already the first discharges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trumps's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence services accused the Kremlin for a long time being targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between Trumps election campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigation is focused on several men who acted as advisers to the Republican in the election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1487">According to report, Mueller also examined more and more trumps of a private and business environment under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"" "the" "" "Washington Post" "" "wrote a few weeks ago that the special agent Trump has personally moved into the centre and undertook the accusation whether the president could possibly hinder the judiciary during the affair." ""</seg>
<seg id="1489">"" "" "" "the main task of Grand Jury is to check this evidence in possible criminal cases and decide whether to be charged." ""</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jury are therefore also called accusations.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Most of the time they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The panel can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor's Office to charge persons to the interrogation under Eid.</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the CNN station, pre-invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">Persons involved in the meeting were called upon to make a statement, called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In addition, they should provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">In addition to Trump Jr. Trumps were also advisors and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his dam manager Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the substitution would show that Mueller did not let himself be intimidated in his work and that if necessary, he wanted to act quickly.</seg>
<seg id="1499">But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched on at the end in order to decide on the rise of an indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1500">"" "" "" "nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1501">In the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents.</seg>
<seg id="1502">"" "" "" "Russia's history is a total invention," "" "said Trump." ""</seg>
<seg id="1503">"" "the issue gives the democrats a chance to" "" "feel good" "", "because they have nothing else that they can talk about." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1505">But this usually works in secret, he stressed.</seg>
<seg id="1506">"" "the White House advocates any measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a" "" "fair" "" "way." ""</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI chief, James Comey, said three times that he would not be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">One has no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the explanation.</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after having fired Trump Comey.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"" "" "" "because of this ploy, accusations against trump have become loud; he wanted to hinder the judiciary." ""</seg>
<seg id="1511">Comey testified in June of a Senate committee that urged him to set up an investigation against former national security adviser Michael Flynn.</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="1513">According to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees.</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">Unlike an independent specialist in the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair around the later President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the presidency of the President of the Ministry of Justice.</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1525">In total, however, for around 30 years there have been a series of unusual breakthroughs of ice cream cones in the region, writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background.</seg>
<seg id="1526">According to many researchers, this could be related to global warming.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The colossus now depleted was part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Shelter floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks off on a regular basis.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this ice shelf the balance of waxing and breaking was disturbed a few years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete ice shelf there.</seg>
<seg id="1533">There is a lot to say that also the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, because the front edge has never been withdrawn as far as at present.</seg>
<seg id="1534">In addition, the ice sheet stands under tension and can fall apart, if at a key site breaking a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1535">The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level as they float on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">However, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before.</seg>
<seg id="1537">This could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only in a small degree, the British research project writes about the observation of Antarctica (Midas).</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth biggest contingent of Antarctica after AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="1539">At the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters.</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"" "" "" "although it is a natural occurrence and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position," "" "said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University." ""</seg>
<seg id="1542">"" "" "" "this is the most popular withdrawal from the beginning of the record," "" "he also confirmed." ""</seg>
<seg id="1543">Scientists have argued whether the Larsen-C-Schelp.dll may grow back or go back in the long run and possibly collapsing, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">Even if these researchers do not return to climate change, the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen apart during the last decades.</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to the British Antarctic Survey research program, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Over the last 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and thus counted among the areas in which the temperature is the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants house tariff at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">Because it becomes more and more difficult to occupy vacancies, the CDU demands to withdraw from the employers' association to become more attractive.</seg>
<seg id="1552">Just before the summer break, 41 new jobs have passed through the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">Now, once again, 17 trainees have their first day of work behind them.</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers at the circle are obviously very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were reported for the places that were to be released this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">Nevertheless, the circle still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks.</seg>
<seg id="1558">At present there are still 50 unoccupied places in the district of Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1559">Among other things, doctors and engineers, as well as forces of general administration, are sought.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In the Kreistag, the CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"" "according to the wishes of the parties, the management should develop" "" "a concept for personnel recruitment and personnel development." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1562">The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented approach of applicants "scarcity.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-climbers and include a training offensive, demand CDU, FDP and UWG.</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">For the circle has to do with personnel problems that you previously did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"" "speech is of a regular" "" "competition of the public employers." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">This includes a high number of employees who leave the service for illness or age.</seg>
<seg id="1569">Thus, it is time to take action so that there are no more places left unoccupied.</seg>
<seg id="1570">But Klaus-Dieter Völker, leader of the CDU, still goes beyond the joint application with his party.</seg>
<seg id="1571">He had long taken care of a lazy surprise in the circle's day when he publicly questioned the costs of personnel and the rest of the parties startled.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "" "" "people want all possibilities to be verified that allow a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association." ""</seg>
<seg id="1573">"" "" "" "if we do not come to a satisfying solution at short notice, the county government with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-related towns - should strive for a house tariff," "" "said peoples." ""</seg>
<seg id="1574">In doing so, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually foresees the public service tariffs.</seg>
<seg id="1575">The salaries are currently strictly required, increases or more money exists only when one changes to a higher level oriented towards career years.</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">Only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new prostitution protection law.</seg>

<seg id="1579">Italy exacerbates the sound to NGO immigrants rescue boats</seg>
<seg id="1580">Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they must not continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs don't sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue," said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa.</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat to the German charity organization 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked effectively with traffickers in a way facilitating illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">The relief organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to express a detailed allegation of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio.</seg>
<seg id="1584">"" "" "" "for us, the salvation of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "" "said the organization in a statement on social media." ""</seg>
<seg id="1585">"" "" "" "we can only judge all accusations currently being collected after we have collected all the information and assess the situation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1586">"" "the Italian authorities had supervised the" "" "Youth Rettet" "" "boat, which Iuventa has been monitoring since October." ""</seg>
<seg id="1587">It is thought that its crew takes tubing migrants aboard, which are delivered to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can take off so that the ships can be used again.</seg>
<seg id="1588">At least one such meeting allegedly took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor of the prosecutor, whose contents were published by Italian media.</seg>
<seg id="1589">The occupation is suspected of exposing itself to the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives.</seg>
<seg id="1590">Under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must first have an Italian police officer who supervises their activities.</seg>
<seg id="1591">Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been willing to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain.</seg>
<seg id="1592">"" "the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring any" "" "significant changes or obstructions" "" "of their rescue operations." ""</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is Nobel laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">In recent weeks, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures had declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit.</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "" "" "in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel," "" "said the minister." ""</seg>
<seg id="1596">He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe.</seg>
<seg id="1597">Climbs and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">Nine Weilermer Bikers, the "Berlin outpost" and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz region for four days to enjoy trials and attractions.</seg>
<seg id="1599">For that there were three friendly guides available.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour conducted at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">View points, partly on towers, from which one could see far above the Pfälzer Wald and the upstream levels.</seg>
<seg id="1604">In between there were always longer ascents, for which long trials were rewarded.</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Popular sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">Again, the lookout spot went to the lookout spot, connected by "flew" Trials and moderate ascents.</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altimeters were announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">Caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome breaks.</seg>
<seg id="1609">In Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled saline brine at the open-air auditorium.</seg>
<seg id="1610">Also Neustadt was headed.</seg>
<seg id="1611">After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and culturally.</seg>

<seg id="1613">In future, the sports stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, rather than fighting with wind and weather over the stadium race?</seg>
<seg id="1614">Fact: e-sport has long since become a serious business, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high amounts included.</seg>
<seg id="1615">These have also recognized the first federal liars who are increasingly involved in this field.</seg>
<seg id="1616">The beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and finally the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport department in mid-July and took two pros for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract.</seg>

<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in the e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year olds, that young people will still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old.</seg>
<seg id="1624">And: the clubs tried to conquer all the possible markets, especially the Asian.</seg>
<seg id="1625">With prominent e-sportsmen under contract, one could be present far more often on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Citizens to Asia.</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">During e-sport, computer games such as "League Of Legends," "Dota 2," "Counterstrike," or the football simulation FIFA have fought on competition level.</seg>
<seg id="1628">As in normal sports, leagues have long since established themselves in which the pros compete against each other.</seg>
<seg id="1629">And in the Asian Games 2022 E-Sport is already part of the official programme.</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a kind of sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">For many, the performance is getting used to the ordinary.</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobó has long argued with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">For the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions which can be found in classical sports - for example increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes.</seg>
<seg id="1634">It also requires cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response capability.</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should not only exercise on the console, but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>

<seg id="1639">The scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1640">The players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles.</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the management consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software (BIU) predicts the rapid growth of e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">By 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and big tournaments.</seg>
<seg id="1643">In three years, turnover is expected to be 130 million.</seg>
<seg id="1644">That is little against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga.</seg>

<seg id="1780">Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires.</seg>
<seg id="1781">In the first years as an artist he was a signatory of greeting cards - which frustrated him.</seg>
<seg id="1782">"the happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job," he once said.</seg>
<seg id="1783">After stops in Lima, New York and Paris, the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s: with the publication of his cartoons in "Paris Match," and then also in the "Stern" and other leading magazines around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1784">Even in China Mordillo found many fans.</seg>
<seg id="1785">The artist was always inspired by cities.</seg>
<seg id="1786">Large, rounded mordillo figures cavort in drawings with the Leaning Tower of Pisa, Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1787">In the early morning, according to his own data, he still sits on the drawing table, working daily for almost ten hours.</seg>
<seg id="1788">Over calendars, puzzles, books for young and old, t-shirts, plush toys and watches, his cute figures continue to find a lot of dissemination around the world.</seg>
<seg id="1789">Since six years he has also been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures.</seg>

<seg id="1796">It has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change.</seg>
<seg id="1797">The lavender is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the disease-borne insects, which scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions, causes great headaches.</seg>
<seg id="1798">Eric Chaisse, expert of the CRIEPPAM Agricultural Research Institute in Provence, said: "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant in recent years has exposed the effects of climate change, which in spring has brought much less rain and in the fall much more.</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">There is also a small zicade, a micro-bacterium that transfers dwarves, and in very dry weather there are many of them. "</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only tourists, it is also very popular for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"" "Eric Chaisse said:" "" "instead of having very long plant clocks with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened." ""</seg>
<seg id="1804">So we have fewer parts with essential oil. "</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of the weekly Riodce usually meet Wednesday to check their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt official and incessant drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">But on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about security.</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them home.</seg>
<seg id="1814">Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies.</seg>
<seg id="1815">They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and gut feelings reach.</seg>
<seg id="1816">There are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalog of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="1817">There is no rest from violence, and while the bodies accumulate throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto has resigned in December 2012. 589 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries this year.</seg>
<seg id="1818">Among the latter is their publisher and their inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas.</seg>
<seg id="1819">"" "" "" "the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "" "said Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1820">His absence is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word "Justice," hangs on the facade of the Ribodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical panamahut.</seg>
<seg id="1821">The workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia.</seg>
<seg id="1822">Although a German Federal Prosecutor's Office was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists, only two criminal proceedings were initiated according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1823">As with most thousands of murders, which are linked every year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely presented in court.</seg>
<seg id="1824">At Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are not comforting and although the terrain is now even more traitor.</seg>
<seg id="1825">Without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit, says Ibarra.</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says.</seg>
<seg id="1827">"" "" "" "as long as we don't know why, we suspend all." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1828">On the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1829">He only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with "Twelfth River."</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to be floating around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">Since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the surrender to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum.</seg>
<seg id="1836">It does not matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the streets every day or that the cemetery is full of decorated, two-story Mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living.</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "rest" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trade routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with guilt that he could not protect his friend.</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">First of all, in February there was the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the competing antitrust factions in the war with Guzman's sons.</seg>
<seg id="1841">This publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks.</seg>
<seg id="1842">The second mistake was to not force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same story.</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for the Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues at the foundation of Rifuce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"" "in Sinaloa," "" "it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the problem of drugs," "" "said Bojorquez." ""</seg>
<seg id="1847">Over time, the newspaper has earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased.</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to deal with.</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Award" for its reporting in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">In the same year, Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drug history wherever it led.</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ award.</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "" "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV." ""</seg>
<seg id="1854">"" "" "" "you have to take over the task that you are looking for as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy." ""</seg>
<seg id="1855">"" "I don't want to be asked:" "" "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1856">The Rifuce team missed Valdez, the fun bird, who was fluent like a dockworker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive.</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">He would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table.</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for the routine to ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best deal with their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"" "" "" "you don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways" "" "to move drugs." ""</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not permitted," said Bojorquez.</seg>
<seg id="1864">The result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation.</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">If it smells wrong, stay away from it.</seg>
<seg id="1867">"" "the anger is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that" "" "smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1868">The old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home.</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">In the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before it became known that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico.</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside, two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the Riface offices in a four-storey building in a mid-size neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">Half in the joke, some of the reporters asked if these officers were among the 50 percent of the policemen who were not trustworthy to the governor.</seg>
<seg id="1874">It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain scenery, where drug gangs are actually under control.</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week, Riodoce has spent three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had a exposé to the government spending, which concentrated on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">And there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, conducting a kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1879">There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so beware advised when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities.</seg>
<seg id="1880">A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century.</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption due to high-profile cases.</seg>
<seg id="1882">Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this area, including one in which a son of "El Chapo" Guzman escaped a military attack.</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months earlier, readers would have considered the Columns of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we had already known what happened," said Villarreal, 46, nicknamed "El Flaco" because of his slender body stature.</seg>
<seg id="1885">"" "" "" "now all channels of communication are broken with our sources." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="1886">The Valdez office became a storage room for signs and stickers that protested against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez caught a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed in the western state of Michoacan.</seg>

<seg id="1891">On that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">During a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of scoring journalists and bringing them around because they told the truth.</seg>
<seg id="1893">She has since asked her to be re-divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity.</seg>
<seg id="1894">"" "Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are" "" "surrounded" "" "by organised crime, government officials and an equally valid society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">In his last book "Narco-Journalism," he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime.</seg>

<seg id="1938">The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as mating, which is also used by many modern animals.</seg>

<seg id="1944">Although the shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today.</seg>
<seg id="1945">It points to the fact that the dinosaur was chased from enough pressure by eating meat nivorous dinosaurs that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shading - think of deer, zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and vulnerable to loot, indicating that this Nodose-rier was exposed to a real battle for survival.</seg>

<seg id="1949">Scientists continue to investigate the animal on clues about his life, including his conserved gut to find out what it has eaten as his last meal.</seg>

<seg id="1951">At that time Alberta was as warm as southern fluorida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much farther inland than they are today.</seg>

<seg id="1954">You don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just want a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is sleeping. "</seg>
<seg id="1955">The Cretaceous period was a time when huge geodes, carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs crossed the earth.</seg>
<seg id="1956">Although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors.</seg>
<seg id="1957">This includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38-foot (11,5 m) long, six tons heavy monster.</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in the mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">The creature was found by Shawn Funk as he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada.</seg>
<seg id="1960">According to the museum, it is the buried dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip.</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were about 18 feet (5 feet) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tips that raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the tortured herbivores were swept through the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater exploration of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the stallions still cover bumpy armored armored plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as "rare as a win in the lottery.</seg>
<seg id="1967">The more I see it, the more confusing it becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remnants of the skin are still covered by the bumpy armored armored plates carrying the skull of the animal.</seg>

<seg id="1974">On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich (A8) about 20 people were injured in a mass arambolage on Thursday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="1975">After the first information of the police, between the junction points Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen (district Aichach-Friedberg) around 30 vehicles, among them probably trucks, crashed into each other.</seg>
<seg id="1976">There are no indications of the exact number of injured persons at first.</seg>
<seg id="1977">It was a light to moderate injury, said a police spokesman.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large array of ambulance vehicles was at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1987">It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced: there is no way to sit in the train and sleep.</seg>

<seg id="1999">To be able to use them, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet.</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to have an online ticket - what already most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">It is also necessary to have bought it via the app of the railway, the DB Navigator, which is the most convenient way of ticket booking anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2005">The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat y.</seg>
<seg id="2006">If the train driver arrives at the ticket inspector at number Y, he knows that a passenger is seated with an already devalued online ticket.</seg>
<seg id="2007">One can therefore continue to sleep, continue to work, keep silent.</seg>
<seg id="2008">"check-in" has two advantages: one for the customer, one for the rail - which in turn should use the passenger.</seg>

<seg id="2011">"" "second plus:" "" "and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2012">Those who often take the train know that in addition to delays and missed trains, ticket inspectors are among the biggest offences.</seg>
<seg id="2013">Because often you have, in any case, one of the co-travelers not all the documents needed for the devaluation of online tickets.</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing, or else a document that must be presented.</seg>
<seg id="2015">The result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger, leading to a bad mood in the section or large room and delays in the control of your own ticket and the conductor at the end takes time to take care of other concerns.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">And that's only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen.</seg>

<seg id="2124">A matching similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning's DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are visible - white, black and brown, which are almost imperceptible - which hang on cables from the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarlem, which were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former secret service analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after having publicly disclosed diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August means A Becoming resemblance (a matching resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">She is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline united her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender and pioneering dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office.</seg>
<seg id="2130">Dewey-Hagborg originated by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA that was extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as someone with these genomic data could look like, a keen, though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the forms of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity.</seg>
<seg id="2131">Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft.</seg>
<seg id="2132">Through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-and-white selfie, in which Manning was visibly sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated.</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015, Dewey-Hagborg arrived just from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette butts and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce an image of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"" "" "" "they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while they were in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "" "explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition." ""</seg>
<seg id="2137">And she could not be visited at that time and she could not be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait.</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal briefs that exchanged several letters over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">They even created a Comic "Suppressed Images," illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President would transform their verdict and would be able to personally see the exhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2140">That Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published to call Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="2141">There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump is conducting a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should actually fix.</seg>
<seg id="2142">When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said, "Things happen for a certain reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">In a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning asked with her superlarge signature (the "i" in her family name) an end to the "automatic fragmentation, whose foundation has been gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - an exchange of Cs and Gs and As, written in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), as surprisingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all.</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with you is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video factory of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2147">"" "" "" "DNA data can tell so many different stories, therefore the 30 of these stories." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2148">The last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel.</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of the United States "disciplinary barracks, like King Kong with a hands-free speech.</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck with your staff at your e-commerce start-up but the polls did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent.</seg>
<seg id="2206">And even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process.</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply never consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed.</seg>
<seg id="2208">It has called people from the outside for help.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is at growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, to address employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases whistleblowers allow to circumvent the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors.</seg>
<seg id="2211">"you now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement.</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams, it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance what units have most ailments and which managers have low consular results - so that you can reboot why.</seg>
<seg id="2214">Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you won't be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment where those who have spoken were punished.</seg>
<seg id="2215">For start-ups such as GLINT, this desire is an overview of a lucrative business opportunity.</seg>
<seg id="2216">Global governance, regulation and compliance industry could be worth more than $118.7 billion by 2020, according to Let's Talk Payments, a financial web site.</seg>
<seg id="2217">Denver, Colorado, start-up Convercent, who helps companies to prevent and detect bad behavior, saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Fanything in Misskredit.</seg>
<seg id="2218">Convercent has nearly 600 clients including Airbnb, Microsoft and Tesla.</seg>
<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>
<seg id="2220">Like GLINT, Convercent companies will send tailor-made "pulse" surveys, collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas.</seg>
<seg id="2221">It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior.</seg>
<seg id="2222">And when the main executive board is involved, complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"" "" "" "the court of public opinion has captured the regulators," "" "said Patrick Quinlan, the founder and managing director of Convercent." ""</seg>
<seg id="2224">When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behave ethically, it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott, employee fluctuation and complaints, said Quinlan.</seg>
<seg id="2225">Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations, has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters.</seg>
<seg id="2226">Earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters, submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2227">It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees.</seg>
<seg id="2228">Now that the company is using Convercent, problems that have been hidden in offices in cities or states can be identified, such as discrimination, harassment or unfair internships more quickly identified and addressed.</seg>
<seg id="2229">"" "" "" "I can approach this holistic, 360-degree view into the experience with employment," "" "said Vitrano, who leads the Risk Management Group by Ruby Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2230">"" "" "" "and we protect our shareholders from employment litigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2231">Companies began to take ethics, values and employee engagement in 2002 after Arthur Andersen's accounting firm collapsed because of ethical clashes caused by the Enron scandal, Quinlan said.</seg>
<seg id="2232">"" "but it took until the" "" "social media came to their right" "" "that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty washing went online." ""</seg>
<seg id="2233">"before using technology to monitor ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said.</seg>
<seg id="2234">Both GLINT and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products.</seg>
<seg id="2235">"" "" "" "it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups." ""</seg>
<seg id="2236">Convercent received $10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, raising the total capital to $47 million.</seg>
<seg id="2237">Glittering secured $10 million in November of Bessemer's venture partner and brought his entire financing to $60 million.</seg>
<seg id="2238">These investments are hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital.</seg>
<seg id="2239">There is a growing complex of research that shows that today's employees expect more from their jobs than before.</seg>
<seg id="2240">In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley, high salaries and interesting projects are only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The employees want to have the feeling that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>
<seg id="2242">"if people are happy to be in a company that owns their voices, and that the work you do is profitable, then they feel more strongly committed to making this company successful," said Nina McQueen, Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn, who used both Convercent and GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2243">Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well. companies run well when employees are committed and committed.</seg>
<seg id="2244">If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees, it is no wonder that you will find support.</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrators of a company do not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">In fact, when a company asks employees for your feedback, it may have an expectation that change is on the way.</seg>
<seg id="2248">And if the change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"" "" "" "if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks," "" "said Russell Raath, President of Consulting at the Business Management Company of Kotter International, who has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data." ""</seg>
<seg id="2250">"" "" "" "because if you do not follow employees ask themselves," "" "Have you really heard me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2251">Do you care about it?</seg>
<seg id="2252">"" "and who doesn't care about why should I?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2253">Madison Reed, who now runs monthly staff surveys, was able to launch action on the same day when a problem is reported about GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2254">And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees, she was able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems.</seg>
<seg id="2255">At Ruby Tuesday the company always receives new insights about the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better binding of employees in a sector known for high turnover.</seg>

<seg id="2264">"" "" "" "this is a real treadmill for the boys next three days," "" "said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Monday to Tuesday." ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">The NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the load of players, and it actually prolongs their days - at least until the final on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="2266">Therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 7: 15 p.m. to meet the already fully packed schedule of players.</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six seasons in Westwood underwent practical exercises.</seg>
<seg id="2268">They are supposed to keep 18 exercises during August. 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their prelude to Texas A & M in September.</seg>

<seg id="2290">Creating a novel: a castle in the history of England</seg>
<seg id="2291">In his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's.</seg>
<seg id="2292">But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cozy seat in the Havl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaiy Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"" "" "" "I think it's so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," "" "he says with one accord." ""</seg>
<seg id="2294">"what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand."</seg>
<seg id="2295">'a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg.</seg>
<seg id="2296">It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="2297">"" "" "" "I only reacted to the thumbprint on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700" s, which worked for the Jacobins, "" "" he says. "" "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"this is his thumb-print!</seg>
<seg id="2299">And letters always smell like smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light.</seg>
<seg id="2300">For someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if he himself would also be there.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Oh, I love archives! "</seg>
<seg id="2302">For someone who is so beaten with old papers he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle for almost four months ("To be honest: I have overrated my welcome grub") seems to be all too beautiful to be true.</seg>
<seg id="2303">Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian "new" castle, view the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hydralls on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the trench.</seg>
<seg id="2304">He walked through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape gardening, gardeners and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book.</seg>
<seg id="2305">"" "then, at night he drank" whiskey and started to write. "" "" "" "</seg>
<seg id="2306">The intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust had received full access until 2006, when the last bin, Elizabeth Hussey, died.</seg>
<seg id="2307">When Rhodes had arrived a decade later, the employees just started to take care of the archive that he described as "hundreds of years in which aristocrats said" Oh, throw it on the attic. "</seg>
<seg id="2308">Diaries, letters from the time of English Empires, cards that represent what possessed: "one could think that land conflicts would be boring," Rhodes says, "but there was a birch fighting for the two families.</seg>
<seg id="2309">"" "boys, let everything go his way!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2310">Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader base into the English story, including 'The Labourer' following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381.</seg>
<seg id="2311">"" "" "" "there is a record from a turmoil who appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex'," "" "says Rhodes." ""</seg>

<seg id="2313">"" "perhaps the two are connected together?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2314">Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like The Priest, which tells the story of the Jesuit patrol that the Darrell family hid for seven years during the English Reformation.</seg>
<seg id="2315">Or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell portrays his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated).</seg>
<seg id="2316">"" "the Darrells are Rhodes's favorite family of Scotney:" "" "the lords seemed to be a feather, always making debt and spending money on things they could not afford." ""</seg>
<seg id="2317">Other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys, with a talent to advertise within. "</seg>

<seg id="2338">Each year in early August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on pensions and promotions in the officer corps.</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance, a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine for the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt.</seg>
<seg id="2342">The meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff, as before, but in the office of the Prime Minister.</seg>
<seg id="2343">The five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister of Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions.</seg>

<seg id="2347">Since the failed coup, head of state Erdogan 169 has fired the 326 generals and admirals.</seg>
<seg id="2348">More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen, who sees Erdogan as a wireer of the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2352">At the end of February, the newspaper Hürriyet published an article entitled "Discomfort in Military Headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2353">On the general staff there are concerns about an increasing "Islamization" of the army, which, among other things, manifests in the lifting of the headline ban for soldiers, wrote the newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2354">This is the case with the army and the security forces.</seg>
<seg id="2355">In mid-July, Erdogan ordered more 7395 state officers by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the real masters of the country earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times, they squandered their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">After his election victory in 2002, Erdogan pressed the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform of the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robots is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">Just as you thought it can't be more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots comes.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes, actually.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">According to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at Sheffield University and co-founder of FRR, we must start taking their Ascension seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2394">Customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and type of finger nail.</seg>
<seg id="2395">"" "" "" "people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," "" "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"" "the user can" "" "customize" "" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the nipples until the type or color of his fingernails." ""</seg>
<seg id="2398">But it gets more worrying as many robots have the "personalities" that would have a stepford-wife look progressive.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">For example, the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness.</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there are the Roxxxy gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of shyness and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible, "warms the website of True Companion.</seg>
<seg id="2403">So she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day, she also has her moods - quite like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"" "she can be tired, be fixed on conversation or she can" "" "be in mood" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step towards frigid (means: rebellious) Farrah, restless one the most.</seg>
<seg id="2407">True Companion Roxxxy was compared to a vibrator on his website, but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"" "" "" "if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "" "it says on the website." ""</seg>
<seg id="2409">However, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sextoy.</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their emergence and increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture, towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">Most men naturally do not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notices their growing popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture.</seg>
<seg id="2412">But what escapes from the boundary zones can be very instructive regarding the spirit of time in which we live.</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time in which the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have sexually attacked women.</seg>
<seg id="2415">The most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Maiden ') is not the graphic images, the muddy body and the cast eyes, but how realistic this vision works.</seg>
<seg id="2416">The Republic of Gilead is a jump, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap.</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to produce a physical likeness to actual women as realistic as technically possible (though with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their growers want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"" "but, brought to the point when it comes to their" "" "personalities" "", "the robots are not real women." ""</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">They have no mediation or background history, nothing that hinders independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total submission.</seg>
<seg id="2422">In other words, they are counterfeit slaves.</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trumps great power?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of a healthy human mind</seg>
<seg id="2426">It has become a certainty of the trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate, have also split families in small-format.</seg>
<seg id="2427">Around Christmas and Thanksgiving, there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump-choosing relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2428">We are all strictly adhering to to blow our filter bags.</seg>
<seg id="2429">Less noticed is the power of Trumps to bring together families.</seg>
<seg id="2430">I mention this because my cousin, a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family, visited me this week in New York.</seg>
<seg id="2431">She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect.</seg>
<seg id="2432">With Trump in the White House everyone whom she knows, including the republican relationship with which she had fought for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side.</seg>
<seg id="2433">This is certainly a good thing about the dining table, but it is important to me that this also brings considerable risks.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The left was strengthened by Trump, but the appalling effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right.</seg>
<seg id="2435">When we speak of "normalisation" and trump, we relate to the creepy way that his bibs of one day will no longer be thrown off.</seg>
<seg id="2436">However, there is still a terrifying long-term scenario in which the dump republicans of the right wing are "normalized," which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness.</seg>
<seg id="2437">Today I find myself from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urakian version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both in comparison to trump in fact occur as very mild offences.</seg>
<seg id="2438">When Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">When my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to the Karussell in Central Park, the largest of the carousel in the New York park department, and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">The horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crisp and the animals turn to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climatising music conveys this in a strange way.</seg>
<seg id="2441">So many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of tall buildings become old, the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement, and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Thirty-five years later, and I am still not fully aware of the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss cottage - the topic Pub ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a big roundabout in northern London.</seg>
<seg id="2443">The Central Park Karusel is still a strange magical experience, as here two two-year-old, one 11-year-old and two women in the 40-he-years can go on it and all have a great time.</seg>
<seg id="2444">If I could have evaluated the carousel, I would have given him the full score, but fortunately no one asked for it.</seg>
<seg id="2445">On the other hand, I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my "experience" with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass through my credit card.</seg>
<seg id="2446">In the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same, plus the option to balance the rating with a 15% tip - this in order to buy something about the counter.</seg>
<seg id="2447">This not only leads to a slowdown of what should actually be a neutral exchange, but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality to a situation where no need is needed.</seg>
<seg id="2448">The poor woman in the department store was disappointing, while I was tired of experiencing my credit card with five stars.</seg>
<seg id="2449">Oscar Pistorius transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain</seg>
<seg id="2450">For the second time, Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit.</seg>
<seg id="2451">Last year, he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist, according to the prison authorities, according to a case in his cell.</seg>
<seg id="2452">On account of murder, Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence after an appeal by the prosecutors.</seg>
<seg id="2453">He killed Steenkamp in the early morning hours of Valentine's Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria.</seg>
<seg id="2454">Pistorius claimed that he held his girlfriend for a nighttime intruder that hid in the cabin.</seg>
<seg id="2455">The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell, of which they say that she is too transparent.</seg>
<seg id="2456">The National Criminal Court said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year.</seg>
<seg id="2457">Pistorius is in danger of his sentence being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful.</seg>
<seg id="2458">There is no death penalty in South Africa.</seg>

<seg id="2463">As a symbol of the dismissal, the 29 pupils of the four classes chose a young eagle under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder, who grew up in the chicken farm, but then released into freedom.</seg>

<seg id="2535">Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, goes into retirement next year.</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written out - but suitable candidates are rare.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Wacker has been a municipal building master for 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he conveys in the press conference.</seg>
<seg id="2539">He reports of varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor.</seg>
<seg id="2540">At the same time, it is surprised that so far no application can fulfil the requirements profile.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">This is to be enough time for familiarization with adherence to regular periods of notice.</seg>
<seg id="2543">Since Haslach works for the administration community as a Lower Building Law Authority, the applicant must present appropriate conclusions.</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">If it could no longer be fulfilled, the citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation.</seg>
<seg id="2546">But the closeness of the city is important to the city and itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working atmosphere as well as good atmosphere between authorities and citizens.</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate may help relieve IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study suggests exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">The incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="2583">While the person affected is usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan protein helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut.</seg>
<seg id="2584">The leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate the body.</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">If the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2587">In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance promotes immunity in mice carrying a certain bacterium in their bowels.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">The more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had from these immune cells. "</seg>
<seg id="2591">He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an diet rich in tryptophan encourages more tolerant, less flammable intestinal microlieus when the same system is also used in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2592">The post-doctoral candidate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance as it found that a group of study mice had such cells, but a different group of the same stem, which was separately accommodated, did not have this.</seg>
<seg id="2593">She assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2594">The intestines of the mice were sequenced by DNA and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice.</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they got the L. reuteri and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">In order to understand how the bacteria spread to the immune system, the researchers left L. reuteri in a liquid and then passed small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells isolated from the mice.</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">When the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid.</seg>
<seg id="2599">If the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice's feed, the number of such cells increased by around 50 percent, but if the tryptophan values were halved, the number of cells decreased by half.</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant-promoting cells as mice and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">It is not known whether tryptophan secondary products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said, "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2672">Who wants to renovate his house in the years can soon get support from the country.</seg>
<seg id="2673">Furthermore, mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of Steg City Development informed them on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="2674">At the beginning of the information event, Schindler once again gave a review of what happened to date.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Since 1991, there have been remediation areas in sensations.</seg>
<seg id="2676">Back then, in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land Baden-Württemberg had taken over two thirds of the funding amount.</seg>
<seg id="2677">In the refurbishment area II between 2005 and 2016, the grant was still 60 percent.</seg>
<seg id="2678">For Schindler, the present renovations are a "success project" - it is important, after all, to promote internal development and not only to open up new areas of construction.</seg>
<seg id="2679">On April 4, the Board of Directors of the Government of Karlsruhe has received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III.</seg>
<seg id="2680">The total sum amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euro would come from the country, the rest of the municipality's feelings.</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a remediation area develop?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"" "you will, as Schindler on, investigate where the" "" "really old" "" "houses are." ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">However, it also plays a role if interest in the planned area is at all interested in rehabilitating.</seg>
<seg id="2684">If necessary, the area boundaries could be postponed again.</seg>
<seg id="2685">On Wednesday evening, the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"" "Keller presented the contents of the Bund-Länder-Programme" "" "Social City" "", "in which frames would then be carried out." ""</seg>
<seg id="2687">The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="2688">The measures would be carried out objectively, that is, per plot.</seg>
<seg id="2689">The remediation area would then finally be established as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The approval period for the funding has been running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Until September of this year, however, the inventory takes place only once, within the scope of which the participants in the rehabilitation area receive a questionnaire.</seg>
<seg id="2692">In November or December, the sentence is to be carried out as soon as possible, so that the restoration can begin next year.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">It is about the evaluation of the urban planning grievances and decide when it is rehabilitated and to what extent.</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a remark in the land register for the respective property.</seg>
<seg id="2696">Pietzschmann will again come to sensations and get a picture of the situation, she promised.</seg>
<seg id="2697">Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the involvement of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore, there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and completed by the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"" "the yellow questionnaire is the" "" "building and plot elbow" "", "which, among other things, is about the construction and renovation views." ""</seg>

<seg id="2716">The Green-White Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was at the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs.</seg>

<seg id="2718">The helicopter, manufactured in Connecticut, was issued next to a yacht from Maine, a fireman car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi.</seg>
<seg id="2719">The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or cargo, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter.</seg>

<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the service hours a second crew would be required for return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">The original crew was during the event with the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane.</seg>

<seg id="2866">The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer, because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous stamp, with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the misuse cases relieves Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement "We are Church," declared after publication against the German press agency, he obtained an apology from the former Regensburg Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as by the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year old brother of Pope Benedict XVI.</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"" "the Vatican paper" "" "Osservatore Romano" "", "on the other hand, criticised that during the reporting on violence in the domes with" "" "double standards" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">With regard to the attacks in Regensburg, nobody doubt that it is "shameful and shameful acts" that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, conspicuous is the "degree of media manipulation," said the author Lucetta Scaraffia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee.</seg>
<seg id="2896">"" "" "" "the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal" "", "writes Scaraffia." ""</seg>
<seg id="2897">"" "Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "" "we like to go to the church and this is a fixed fresnel." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2898">"" "she also pointed out that in her youth," "" "punches were a normal educational remedy," "" "to deal with cheeky children, as I was one." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2899">It is unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared.</seg>
<seg id="2901">"" "completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the" "" "My brother of the Pope" "" "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)." ""</seg>
<seg id="2902">"" "" "" "I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "" "says Hesemann," "" "because all this had nothing to do with him," "" "he evaluates the results of the final report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly stands in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"" "a total of 547 earthenware domes were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" "" "with high plausibility" "" "victims of assault, 67 domes." ""</seg>
<seg id="2905">In the final report it is said to Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994: "in summary, it can be said that Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychological violence.</seg>
<seg id="2906">Especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more fierce.</seg>
<seg id="2907">Nevertheless, unlike many other accused, many victims underestimated that many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and that in many cases, despite violence, they even associate positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"" "Mr. Hesemann, the 440-pages report on the" "" "Incidents of Violence Exercise at Protective Recommended at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "" "gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger." ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">For one, many pupils highlight his "humanity."</seg>
<seg id="2911">On the other hand, it also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which became tangible to the economist when a domes musically did not produce top performance.</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger appears at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly exposed to any suspicion of complicity or co-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">One can pretend it at best, learn from it too late or have taken first indications seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">The Domspatzengymnasium, where he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as "redemption," "heaven" and "better world."</seg>
<seg id="2918">The vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony as "warm-hearted," "popular," "sincere," "competent" and "understanding," as extremely good-natured teachers who regularly supplied the guys with cakes, biscuits and candy and "always surrounded by the grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">Only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotionality, which also once led to abutquarries.</seg>
<seg id="2920">The fact that he didn't just kneel with chairs and threw the key ring on the floor, but also gave ear figs and pulled too naughty boys to the hair or ears, he himself admitted years ago, deeply regrets and apologized for it.</seg>
<seg id="2921">To his salvation, however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable period, in the 1960s and 1970s, with parents such as with teachers.</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">Of course, I think each one of us who was born before 1968.</seg>
<seg id="2924">I have also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2925">Compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the exhorrence of violence at the pre-school, these are certainly bagatellen.</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether it is not with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just crashed on him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">Many who have never understood him are still working diligently at the Bavarian Pope.</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">In the media, in connection with the report, there was a lot about the topic of misuse in the Regensburg domain sparrows.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger also subjected to any involvement or co-acquaintance with regard to sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault has claimed to be entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"" "" "" "I have never dared to talk with my father or mother," "" "said an affected person on behalf of others," "" "It was all very embarrassing for me." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem with clarification of sexual abuse was and is, however, that most victims are silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">If they didn't even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen School students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student formulated it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see any case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">I think it... even for really absurd, to assume that... Bubs have opened intrusive or clearer or even more than against their parents, dormitory managers, trustworthy teachers, etc.</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"" "thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "" "the fact that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in advance could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2942">As far as sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any co-knowing.</seg>
<seg id="2943">So he cannot be accused of preventing him or having brought him to the ad.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these illegal crimes, as it unfortunately happened in some cases.</seg>
<seg id="2945">In the media a lot of "non-violence" was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"" "the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "" "Look at" "" "in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything mixed and mixed in the coverage has become a huge cheek out of sexual abuse and robbery and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly the case of misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">Since it is cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the secondary school of the cathedral-cats, between sexual abuse and nonviolence as well as, let's say, other accusations.</seg>
<seg id="2951">In addition, the report treats incidents from the period since 1945, so also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the cathedral-cats.</seg>
<seg id="2952">The whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were wrongly crooked and maloloured and suffering from them, all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where there really had to be scandalous conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2953">But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys on his face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium.</seg>
<seg id="2954">On the one hand, as most witnesses emphasize, the topic of "pre-school" taboo.</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"" "and this is also true for Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" "" "many victims rated the Universal Humanity of R." "", "and that is why in many cases, despite violence, they even associate positive memories with him." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2959">At the most, the accusation remains to be looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">But despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school.</seg>
<seg id="2961">The first time 1970 / 71, when he began to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993.</seg>
<seg id="2962">Does Georg Ratzinger consistently shut the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domsplitter-gymnasium, which the report even reproduced.</seg>
<seg id="2964">"" "in this he points out that" "" "that in the pre-school the trial will continue to be practised." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="2965">Even in the face of the danger of negative press release, he advised urgent intervention.</seg>
<seg id="2966">That was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test punishments were banned in Bavaria too long ago.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Before that, they took place in a juridical grey area, as each of us knows.</seg>
<seg id="2968">It was also difficult for him to estimate where the affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permissible limit had actually been exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is just not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980, the test was officially abolished at schools in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis asserted that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"" "Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" "" "Fallstrick of Anachronism" "", "that is, the danger to evaluate the past according to today's moral standards." ""</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right there.</seg>
<seg id="2976">But this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which was abhorred at all times and also not for what was broken in the pre-school of resistance and violence to innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time.</seg>
<seg id="2977">That's all very horrible and I'm glad that it is finally worked out.</seg>
<seg id="2978">But at the same time I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him.</seg>
<seg id="2979">His means of disciplining and punishing, so cattery and ears, were widespread in the 1970s.</seg>
<seg id="2980">When physical punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly in mind.</seg>
<seg id="2981">"" "what image of his time in Regensburg has been shown by Georg Ratzinger in the discussions with you for the book" "" "My Brother the Pope" "" "?" ""</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of test appeal also speak to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, the cathedral-cats only played a minor role.</seg>
<seg id="2984">Nevertheless, I do not at all conceal that he led a strict regiment there.</seg>
<seg id="2985">But even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without asking for unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world transcendence, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991).</seg>
<seg id="2986">With biscuits and candies alone, one does not even make a big singer and before every success, regardless of the area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming.</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the discussions with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep-believing and hearty people, of which you can't imagine that he could only do a fly.</seg>
<seg id="2989">I regularly receive regular contact with him, like many former domes still today, 23 years after his expiration, visit him, read it - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority.</seg>
<seg id="2991">Today most of the domes are thankful to him that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">And that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely respectable person, to which they still look up and which they almost glorify.</seg>
<seg id="2993">And please, again clearly: everything you submit to him are educational methods that were on the agenda back then.</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">But it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat.</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intent behind it is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">For the report, which was just published, relieves it.</seg>
<seg id="2998">Now the starting point would be a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany nobody knows the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace.</seg>
