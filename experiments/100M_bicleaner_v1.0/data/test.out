28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old cook recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
the victim &apos;s brother said he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; Fin@@ ally he went up with him again . &quot;
the cor@@ p@@ se , which was found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , was identified as the 28 @-@ year old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco .
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigations are underway .
the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , informed the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had caught his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters restaurant in San Francisco six months ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters said that they were &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed and destroyed on the ground &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Louis Gal@@ icia announced that Frank first lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; things for him finally went up . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO .
Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could not imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
connecting his family with his family was to cook something for us , preparing us dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia .
he never wanted to take part in any kind of dispute .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
anyone who has information about the case is asked to call the sign on the S@@ F@@ PD at number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always put in drawers
Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ equi@@ voc@@ ally clear in an interview .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I &apos;m always stuck in drawers or glued from outside labels that have little to do with me and the reality . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather slu@@ gg@@ ish to me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jen@@ ni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ mop@@ olitan &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the act@@ ress would like to spend her time at home , in front of the TV with embroi@@ dered D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for white gl@@ ut , she asks the question of the desire for children : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s game , &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs with us from August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger gets the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger and some colleagues were looking for a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden Sports Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
after a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays , they drove home to the for@@ age trou@@ gh@@ s in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p .
a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid .
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says .
and thus the riding career ended again .
on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
he let himself be led with his family about the system of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even swear for photo @-@ purposes .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sport aid handed the man from An@@ hausen to the Golden Sports Py@@ ramid as part of a small gala .
there is no lack of awards to the symp@@ a@@ thetic ath@@ lete .
Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes Lor@@ lau@@ rel , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ...
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
long is the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid .
on Saturday he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler in Aachen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because she is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lan@@ ger has been supporting young people for decades .
and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time US master winner was admitted to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hall of F@@ ame des deutschen Sports &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Saturday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ engen , the F@@ echter Cornel@@ ia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the ski@@ pper Al@@ win Sch@@ ock@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um der Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich .
many of these sports legend had come to Aachen on Saturday .
after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ st@@ adion , where the Lav@@ azza prize ran .
Bernhard Lan@@ ger was far from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ um@@ ps Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements T@@ TP - both are Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
however , the two US presidential competitors are at the helm of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question .
the difference in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , more philosophical distinction .
der , about the role of the state .
tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it , he says .
he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , asser@@ ts Tr@@ ump .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he will mas@@ sively withdraw regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and for companies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the state has to fulfil certain tasks , it has dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore taxes for the rich would be increased , they say .
interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure .
in the need to invest , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost all the same .
the democratic candidate has not announced the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical wing of the Republi@@ cans .
so there could be partial discussions on Tr@@ ump .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re@@ tract coal mining in the US .
oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement wants to termin@@ ate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , on the other hand , intends to extend and demand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other .
T@@ PP , the tran@@ sit@@ ory trade agreement , do not want to sign both .
at the same time , however , both of them do not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade , but simply want to protect American jobs better .
they should be paid better then , for example Clinton .
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage of hunger .
it wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour .
what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to get up , then he says he must not be changed .
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
on the one hand , Tr@@ ump is standing , who wants to relieve the economy and its citizens in order to boost growth .
his critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater .
on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least one of the rich wants them to pay more taxes , and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either .
&quot; &quot; &quot; escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sexual violence belongs to women who are fle@@ eing themselves , almost everyday .
when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
four women sit in a large kitchen .
each one has a baby that is at the most a year old .
she put her little son in her arms .
he looked curi@@ ously with big eyes in the room .
his mother gaz@@ es at the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
she is the Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a suppor@@ ter of social assistance in Bavaria , and among other things she deals with the issue of women on the run .
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
they live in the north of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ fle@@ eing women and their children in Bavaria .
in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs launched the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid .
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors either .
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; men flee because of wars because they are pursued politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in women there are other reasons for the escape : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly because they do not see any other way out . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in their homeland , they have experienced sexual violence , compul@@ sion , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution .
this is what drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; who believes that the end as soon as they are arriving in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
here too , single women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case .
this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the housing in the North of Munich are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience because the shame is too big . &quot;
since they often don &apos;t know how to help , there are more accommodations just for them , demands B@@ ahr .
in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the placing of refugees .
on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no .
there is no such thing in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia .
also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone @-@ fled women are not separated , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokes@@ man of the government .
in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Middle Fran@@ con@@ ia there are stories in some common shel@@ ters or houses only for single women and their children .
the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations for women only .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the committee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a study published for the committee it says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very important that men and women are being har@@ med separately . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lacks privacy or are housed together by men and women , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
especially the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , is in the study .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how much women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush that there is on the house in Munich . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have spoken about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new employment policies
representatives of the Regi@@ stra@@ in@@ arians have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new employment policies in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( B@@ MA ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work @-@ fighting measures starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC states that the ministers had agreed to respond to the concerns about the contract .
in July , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed upon the rejection of a contract agreed with the B@@ MA .
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; issues , which led to the rejection of the Treaty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to fully reject the proposed new contract and call for official ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ations to all your concerns . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in response to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the B@@ MA Council to appro@@ ve an ongoing programme of escal@@ ating unemployment rates starting at the beginning of September .
the disputes caused that assistance physicians struck six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS .
the head of the B@@ MA assistant doctors Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana resig@@ ned after the election for the rejection of the agreed contract conditions recommended by the B@@ MA .
he informed B@@ MA members during the meetings , which were before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with the conclusion that the contract was beneficial and should be accepted .
following the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y H@@ unt said that the contract for doctors in England would be for@@ ci@@ bly introduced .
Russia and Turkey : an alliance of out@@ si@@ ders ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight @-@ month long @-@ lasting war of words and economic sanctions .
but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counter@@ part in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace in reception , I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconc@@ ile this reconciliation .
there was the hand@@ shake , yes .
but Putin &apos;s smile seemed to sm@@ alli@@ sh and he hardly radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined relations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dear friend &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it anymore .
he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but would even improve .
the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if something bad had never happened .
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite .
but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing .
rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to mention in its introduc@@ tory words : the firing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey .
Moscow &apos;s reaction at that time was fur@@ ious .
Putin announced and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia .
the offen@@ se was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend .
to re@@ build the ve@@ to is difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara .
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
most serious were the alleg@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan had prof@@ ited from illegal oil trading in Syria &apos;s regions , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan to hear him .
Russia could book a kind of victory .
for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ as@@ ef@@ ire are clear .
Erdo@@ gan , primarily , needs all the friends he can get after he became extin@@ ct in the last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be facilit@@ ated when the flights are res@@ um@@ ed .
they count on a later seasonal attack on the Mediterranean .
this week , the State TV predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a report in Ve@@ dem@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempt to seize power as a weak response .
to this end , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment over the s@@ nail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool sen@@ timent and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West .
the Russian head of state in Ankara won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected State organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
this is a matter of course for Moscow , which itself has a deep fear of regime change .
the summit in this gl@@ itter@@ ing palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portra@@ y an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; as an analy@@ st once described me : two countries that are driven by the West and feel bad treated and now unite .
nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two .
the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides .
it might be significant that after almost three hours of preliminary talks , both pres@@ idents were at the press conference stating that they did not even strike the subject .
the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this .
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey sh@@ ook the Russian struggle - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once more .
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
according to the CEO of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand will only be reduced to a back office role .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan informed the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
in this period , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts have used &quot; R@@ BS &quot; to protect other consumer @-@ consumer brands .
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national marks into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized .
in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized head office and the stock quotes will change to Nat@@ West .
the brand Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
there are other smaller brands for private clients that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank .
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investment brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy as we now become a bank of brands . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the Bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local goals . &quot; &quot; &quot;
each of these brands will stand in their own congregations for something completely different and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will not continue to sponsor his Six Nations sponsor@@ ship and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is time for us to become a bank of the brands , for how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the CEO . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal when we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands .
but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes .
we can launch these brands again , so I think the time has come .

D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th gain
on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market .
he set a milestone on Pre@@ dil@@ ection , trained by John Gos@@ sel , on his local race track with his second win of the night .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey who reaches the milestone in the flat race .
he succe@@ eds Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar before , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people .
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori perc@@ ei@@ ves the jubil@@ ation when he reco@@ vers victory on pre@@ dil@@ ection
two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career .
L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ Se@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 car@@ eers
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey in the modern world and it is no surprise that he has reached this milestone , which few have reached before him .
he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intell@@ ect that differs from the others in the weight control room .
he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma has been enthusiastic fans for years for this sport .
I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already taken 6@@ ,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey !
Frank@@ ie has already had nearly 30 years of winners in the UK , which is great .
he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey .
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British flat race for two decades .
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug prohibition . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six month ban , but he showed an impressive strong point of strength to def@@ y his doub@@ ters and to return to his best form .
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue doing competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin recently fired his Chief of Staff Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s closest family of trust for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is said that without stating reasons , Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been a substitute for Ivan@@ ov@@ s since 2012 , has been appointed to his successor .
V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at .
born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations ( M@@ GI@@ MO ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy .
on the website of the Krem@@ lin it is called ( in Russian ) that he later was the head of the head of the head of the government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said about his appointment to Putin : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Putin informed the Russian TV broad@@ ca@@ ster on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Serge@@ i Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest confi@@ den@@ ers for a long time and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB .
as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
at a meeting with President Putin , broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resig@@ ns at his own request .
but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections .
so what is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this right now .
but the official asser@@ tion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - met with great scep@@ ticism .
in his remarks to Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to give me this very complicated position - you could almost say - to confi@@ de up for four years .
as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V received the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and , as Putin , a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
in the late 1990s , when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy .
when Putin arrived in power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he tru@@ sts most .
it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , since a third term of office would have viol@@ ated Putin &apos;s constitution .
but this post was taken by another con@@ serving ally Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev .
Putin became Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producer
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announced his resig@@ nation in a joint statement .
Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al on Thursday .
on the set , there were artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
I regre@@ t@@ ted the incident , &quot; he said in a message .
details on how the character of Gi@@ bs@@ on from the series , which follows a team of FB@@ I agents , is expected to be published at a later date according to the statement of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios .
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com D@@ har@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been part of the series since the first season of the series in 2005 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I love the Criminal Court and put my whole blood blood in the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible .
I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans one can only wish for a series .
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
puzzles for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a population of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that it could take about 75 fishes around Sand@@ a@@ ale , which were sp@@ ed by a fountain of foun@@ tains .
Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released on Per@@ is@@ cope a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could throw some light on the appearance of the two inch long fish .
Que@@ ens@@ nar@@ es Crossing : bridge combined with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ er cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is the first of four closing of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deck @-@ blo@@ wers &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which are approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons .
it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 hel@@ ical ropes .
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Kei@@ th Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ er cross@@ ings . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge .
despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit .
in total , almost 79 % of the total de@@ cks are in their place and the last section of the deck today gets a dr@@ one for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Construc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first shutter represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fantastic project represents the closure of future @-@ oriented high and civil engineering .
after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the north tower , we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the country side .
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6@@ ,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx . 3 % .
delicate because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ metres .
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; three men have &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; after they were thrown at Angl@@ es@@ ey by their fishing boat . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI lif@@ ebo@@ at killed 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men strug@@ gled to swim in safety while their boat moved on from their own strength .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we saw how the boat turned around and imagined the worst , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the leader of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones &apos;s rescue station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of its reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a boat without a life@@ jacket .
they were all aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water are lucky and still alive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who ste@@ ered the boat .
someone guar@@ ding these men today .
seriously injured - man puts on his ex @-@ girl@@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
as the police told yesterday , the 50 year old had the key to the apartment to get his personal things .
instead , the alcoholic perpet@@ r@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed twice to her .
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girl@@ friend , he called his mother .
this then al@@ armed his sister .
together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother .
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ life partner .
when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old sli@@ pped his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girl@@ friend .
who builds favor@@ ably priced apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Gre@@ ens mean : in the future , investors are to be taken much stronger in the future . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1,@@ 300 affordable housing in the next few years ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; housing concept living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the next council meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but quar@@ rel is programmed .
first and foremost , it &apos;s about the question : who should actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are united with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the cheap apartments can also be built on stock .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such surfaces , but as far as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a new municipal housing development program , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , is intended to provide incentives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even harder jobs for investors .
not@@ withstanding that , as Brat@@ st@@ mann , there is a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market .
if the action plan is implemented , this will take care of additional tasks in the building management .
more staff is needed .
it is uncle@@ ar whether we will get skilled workers .
but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway .
but how does one compensate the loss of further 1,@@ 300 favorable apartments whose support will take place over the next few years ?
by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments .
in order to prevent this , so the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm , should now be bought out bonds from the city .
in addition , it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price fast@@ ener .
this is possible in the western city .
at one stroke the problem could be solved .
for in the west @-@ city , dead@@ lines run out at the end of the year .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price fast@@ ener for cheap apartments .
only : this does not want the owners , the flat building companies .
because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dramatically again , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called thorou@@ gh@@ fare .
there will be no more concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few city districts .
the Gre@@ ens anticip@@ ate that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; s &amp; D Group President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke comments : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a large majority , the CD@@ U has to go into the boat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can &apos;t be found yet .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
that teenagers and children do not go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many in the last decade .
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
the time on the screen was initially on TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones .
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other .
of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s ( later they created a carto@@ on , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) .
like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand started in early July .
the market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that the servers over@@ loaded .
within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter .
how does it work ?
in short , players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons tracking with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photograph@@ ed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot;
a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the tur@@ key and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa .
in the USA , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person withdraw@@ s every day .
Car@@ di@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which followed 3@@ 5.000 users , recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent .
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; take 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people looking el@@ event@@ h . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , the importance of sports cannot be over@@ rated .
those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression .
physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here .
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that makes them fun .
thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun .
some people even make new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
as always , there are also mur@@ ky game spo@@ ils that always have to complain about something .
and yes , someone could walk against a door .
what &apos;s it about ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
even though smart phone apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they have no reason to do sport as it does this game .
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
due to Pok@@ em@@ on &apos;s success , however , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ator in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active , more f@@ itter and heal@@ thier .

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ian Valley
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
eff@@ or@@ tless on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on whole line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m th@@ urs@@ day to the multi @-@ campaign title and magni@@ fied the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
her overall score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
the female Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nt on the balance beam during the solo multi @-@ campaign of women in gymnas@@ tics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday .
Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who wins a multi @-@ fight title and in total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all .
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
Bil@@ es has dominated the sport for the last three years , 15 world med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
it awa@@ ited her last examination in Brazil , a competition that did not go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations .
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be seen as a dis@@ appointment .
the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ camp@@ al of women in gymnas@@ tics at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday
Bil@@ ly took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell celebration of the reti@@ ring team ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as ex@@ clamation mark .
although Bil@@ ly insist@@ ed that during their long way to the top , never planned the future , this is not really true .
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympi@@ a@@ arena in Rio .
this is no coinci@@ dence .
this girl adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans during a school excursion into the gym@@ nasi@@ um , trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man , became a force .
since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost any competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will last as long as it wishes .
even though Must@@ afa was slightly led by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive .
bri@@ g@@ ade bars and bott@@ oms - in which Bil@@ e holds the world title - l@@ ur@@ king .
she got back with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the beam back - and sat on top of it with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor .
Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently when she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es glossy red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality .
the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal went to Must@@ af@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke .
this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by the Americans , had a lead .
after her cultivation practice she threw out kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared doub@@ t@@ ful .
as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning at the beginning of this week :
police : 3 cas@@ u@@ alties in series mur@@ der@@ ers shot when listening to music in the car
according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade ago in Phoenix , while listening to the car and listening to music .
Angela Rochelle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
the police announced that the thre@@ ef@@ old murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , owned by one of the adult victims .
Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks .
in total , seven people were killed in nine out of a period of four months and two were injured in nine attacks .
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; announced Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month .
it is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles , including a brown car from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln .
the investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same assass@@ in .
El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later .
liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot .
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report about the shooting , which cleared an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the three @-@ fold murder and assumed that it was the factory of serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; mother of a 6 year old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother .
but like the f@@ ew@@ est of his aging , Ed@@ mund has micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder that his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy .
when he came home for the first time , my first thought was , I did not create that .
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; &quot; &quot; what is not right at all -- of course you have settled on it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund can never recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my first answer was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I did not know that people still do &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but it is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Elizabeth shows the sign language Ed@@ mund refers to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Please sing me something . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters on its own .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of the infected with the Z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to rec@@ alls the emotional price of a uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t really know .
I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect someone to really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of inf@@ ants with birth defects caused by the z@@ ic@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi
heavy rainf@@ alls and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency room on Friday . it will be reck@@ oned with more rainf@@ alls throughout the Saturday .
numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ded their banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National Weather Service reported .
the governor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already underway to help the affected communities .
Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that inquiries for flood @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand bags increased .
Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa would have requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service indicated that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama a flood warning system was used on Friday as it continued to rain in the area of Mobile .
the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are likely to reach record levels over the weekend .
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses near the nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
he also said that a downstream floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these rivers are slowly flowing into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the tro@@ dden rivers .
the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , arrived on Friday at 09.@@ 00 the highest level ever recorded .
rescue teams still tied people out of the flood waters in the district of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his son &apos;s son were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed by Glo@@ ster on Friday .
Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that Be@@ aver Creek water , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly over night .
he said that a further step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we wo@@ ke up and the water flo@@ ated and stre@@ amed in , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it reached my waist .
his wife told Hans@@ ford that she had never seen such a flood of the river in the 48 years in which she lived there .
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all obstruc@@ tions and he would be the only one to swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency services could have res@@ cu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; spread quickly &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as there were still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer reported from Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain .
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil has been considerably absorbed by rainf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching loss in five school districts .
the WW@@ L subsidiary reported that a co @-@ operation in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 floo@@ ded houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now floo@@ ded both .
the leader of the Municip@@ ality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had saved 72 people and seven pets donated by the floods .
in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up in order to accommodate the evacu@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will return to their houses again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of roads were closed due to the high water and sand bags for the inhabitants were provided , which hope to keep the water out of their houses and shops .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast .
according to his data , a handful of houses were reported to have been reported as floo@@ ded on Thursday , but no reported on Friday until now .
Kei@@ th Tow@@ n@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have seen water in places where I never saw it before , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Tow@@ n@@ son said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and it &apos;s still coming . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; pier@@ ced by spheres , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia
the police announced that the six @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the grand@@ parents admitted that Brown had suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital during his transportation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pier@@ ced by balls , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said his grand@@ mother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ano@@ z to the transmitter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy told the transmitter that he is likely to recover again .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable condition according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
the boy was found at the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter .
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just found whether one of the injured men could be the offen@@ ders .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it apparently had come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
cartridge sleeves for storm ri@@ fl@@ es , which were trac@@ ed back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es , over@@ lap the scene .
it seems that it has acted clearly for a continuous struggle .
on the road , on both sides of the walk@@ way , were located .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in this way , there seem to have been several armed fighters who were very active &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di reported to the police station in Philadelphia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently re@@ port@@ edly reviewed the surveillance video .
on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a crus@@ her on the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of the West O@@ ak Lan@@ e .
she reco@@ vers and the police are still searching for a suspect .
why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the gym@@ n@@ ast and that out of more than one reason .
firstly , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant .
and second , this team has three tur@@ ners , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin tone .
the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lics , makes everyone proud .
this team finally reflects the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic @-@ feminine presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years , the number one among female tur@@ ners was an African @-@ American .
last year Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 were .
this shows strength .
during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was che@@ ered by a surprising Olympic winner and America .
now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three @-@ time world champion Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms routines .
on Thursday , Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman who won gold at an individual competition for women .
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
we experience the top of this sport , but do not look like gym@@ n@@ astic classes throughout the country .
Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison in order to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as trainer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the reality is that Tur@@ nen is an expensive sport and gym@@ na@@ sts primarily in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents , who pay for training , training , travel clothing , competition and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) .
the majority of these gym@@ nasi@@ ums lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families .
A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics .
we have to give the churches au@@ n innum@@ erable , young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ reach gymnas@@ tics training .
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation for 20 years .
at my events we have offered free and affordable Tur@@ nen in Harlem for over 15,000 urban juven@@ iles ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners .
in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer the youth a high @-@ quality gym@@ n@@ ast , earning the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport .
Tur@@ nen develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind .
this combination offers lifel@@ ong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great .
it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls .
this is such an exciting time .
thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thanks , you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to get their way to becoming healthy , strong and successful young women .
assistance doctors would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 assist@@ ants voted for a vote rejected him .
in July H@@ unt had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the N@@ HS would be in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay would be det@@ ri@@ mental to the employees and patients .
the first assist@@ ants are supposed to receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend fees , in order to improve the maintenance .
Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chairman of the B@@ MA committee for assist@@ ants shared last night in a message : &quot; assist@@ ants have felt serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and have agreed to treat all physicians . &quot;
with only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out .
efforts on the part of the B@@ MA to resolve disputes by talks have met with the government for rel@@ uc@@ tance to participate and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
that was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y H@@ unt had made last month that his door would always be open .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Jerem@@ y H@@ unt must act now , raise awareness and address the concerns of the assist@@ ants . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he does not do so , the assist@@ ants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures .
the last strike at the end of April saw a postpon@@ ement of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were included in order to allow doctors to cover the strike post chain .
the ministers hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
the B@@ MA would like to pay a better week pay for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants who are subject to the contract .
Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS Staff , called on the assist@@ ants to stop the strike .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; work @-@ fighting measures achieve nothing but little , burden on already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patients , pa@@ ws and their families only concerns , needs and dis@@ ruption . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
over the past two months , we talked to the Assistant Doc@@ tors &quot; Committee and responded favor@@ ably to the concerns of guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ one with the Ministry of Health as well as other mini@@ stries .
employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending , flexibility in training sessions , training courses , mutual recognition of the cur@@ riculum , training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the B@@ MA agreements in November , February and May .
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can lower heart rate risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
the drug is administered after a heart attack for 12 months , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory authority N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
around 14@@ 0,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke .
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty tissue in the ar@@ tery walls that form plaque .
when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack .
when the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke .
persons who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk .
T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , manufactured by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more unlikely .
the draft of N@@ ICE , published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years .
Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is effective in combination with aspir@@ in to reduce further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who have already had a heart attack .
with a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it .
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness &apos;s culture flour@@ ishes in Muslim areas
former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year for dis@@ miss@@ al of a government report on corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les verb@@ ally acc@@ esses the police , election ob@@ servers and town halls to ignore evi@@ den@@ ces of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot;
the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , which is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shut@@ ters outside of elec@@ tive cabins to protect impaired voters .
he recommends that voters should have an identification with him in order to prove their identity in elections .
at present , a vot@@ er just needs to call his name and address .
the report suggests not removing removable ink on a person &apos;s finger if they release their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection , says Sir Eric .
he calls for the press to have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report was ordered by Dow@@ ning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election sk@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
last year , a special electoral court decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office .
the Court found that Rah@@ man would have per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with ra@@ cism and Islam@@ opho@@ bic crimes .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
up to 300 votes were either doub@@ t@@ ful or the consequence of a im@@ itation in which one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
he expressed himself in particular al@@ arming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including conducting expressions to prove the identity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in his report , it is said : &quot; as evidence , pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to vote according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions have know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically correct &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric mentioned 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the ban that political activists edit letter selection documents to stop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election re@@ aping . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the report dra@@ fted by Ther@@ esa May also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral process from being used for immigration and social security purposes .
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on a person &apos;s finger as soon as she has em@@ itted her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
to carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation of mo@@ tions to an automatic letter of letters .
bann@@ ing political activists to process complete let@@ ter@@ ets and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ ets .
the police give the authority to set up shut @-@ off stations for elec@@ tive stations .
a change of law that facilit@@ ated an indictment due to in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entative Act in 1983 ) .
prohibition of photography in elec@@ tive stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the voting stations ( except Wales ) .
intensi@@ fying the training to ensure that employees are generally able to asser@@ t that voters go alone into the election cabin .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case , there was no criminal complaint .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he was found guilty due to a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check @-@ checks &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the election registration departments of the town halls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliament , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of poll@@ s and den@@ ial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation .
crazy about K@@ ate Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger from Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed by the French cycli@@ st Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who proved to be an impressive double predecessor of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is by far not the only Ath@@ lete , fighting for gold , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties .
the fighter and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son , left , has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio
apart from K@@ ate &apos;s Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the bicycle race , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be .
the team member of the U.S. team in Arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy El@@ li@@ son has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ins@@ an@@ ity in the social media and admitted that he had already heard since his childhood that he looks like Leo .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see any great simil@@ arity with the exception of facial hair , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s a good looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the centre of attention this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
the Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is supposed to go through as a double @-@ companion for the Cu@@ ban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
getting higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor
another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal in Y@@ uli@@ a E@@ f@@ im@@ ova points out more than just sun tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian von Goisern was att@@ ested to an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
strong women : hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the pair .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Twitter user told her satisfaction that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jen@@ ni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face to face and eyes .
other popular compar@@ isons included K@@ err@@ i Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile similar to Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympics exc@@ uses for his statement that Chinese call@@ ers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ estyle swimming pool emp@@ tied audience of the C@@ BC live broadcast of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
the Canadian broad@@ ca@@ ster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float &quot; as called down &quot; and during the race like &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m free @-@ floating swimming pool .
Mac@@ Donald , who was brought aboard the comment@@ ator team of the C@@ BS in order to give more &quot; colour , &quot; one could hear : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
too excited , went down like M@@ ief , died like a pig .
thank you for this .
the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1,@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled Canadi@@ ans to close the gap to China .
audience in all Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shock@@ ed by the sound and language
&quot; &quot; &quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ as the C@@ BC comment@@ ator has just said that the 14 year old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the I@@ di@@ ot did not capture that they were still on show . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai &apos;s Yan@@ han , China , was described as follows in the fin@@ als 4 x 200m open @-@ air swimming pool for women : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese woman has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many ordered him to speak .
Twitter users did not hold back when they heard how un@@ aware By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald was
another Twitter user in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # by@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald .
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and lets all look like Ras@@ si@@ sts . # ange@@ ek@@ els .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC programme , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the commentary by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the commentary on a swimming performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was an un@@ happy formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end of 90 times with people responding to the B@@ emer@@ kt via Twitter
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology to more than 90 other Twitter users who compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ don@@ ald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media .
to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ ons comments related to the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on them as a person .
nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ happy formulation . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry .
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ don@@ ald ap@@ ologi@@ zed and tried to justify his re@@ mark by decl@@ aring that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s swimming pool in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on her as a person . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who tried sham@@ elessly under@@ wear in the middle of business
the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman went out of her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants .
in order to wor@@ sen the situation she numbered her , as she looked out in her , pulled her out and put her back into the shelf .
she continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place shopping m@@ all in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the pants before she put her back into the shelf
a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ d@@ son who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman tried under@@ wear , &quot; she came back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out its own str@@ ums and pants and ta@@ sted it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y as Osk@@ ar . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the pants , which she obviously didn &apos;t like , because she put her back into the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same thing with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like anything to go back and out .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she didn &apos;t seem to bo@@ ther anyone who was watching someone - or thinking about the person who was under certain circumstances to buy the under@@ pants she had tried . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mrs. Davi@@ d@@ son , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; how re@@ voc@@ ally to think that someone would take home dr@@ unk@@ ards that had a different person and who were not washed . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr@@ s Davi@@ d@@ son added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull clothes from the sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and went out and did not wash her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
all products in question have been withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself against weapons of arms with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance .
regardless of whether you are approaching from front or back , this video will show you how to turn it around for your rob@@ ber .
when you get closer to you , then you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and go out of the shot line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
then grab the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bow .
then strike it with your knee in the bar and twist while the attack@@ er interfer@@ es with pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backwards as they judge the weapon on him .
in case of sei@@ z@@ ure approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can not shoot .
shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and strike the attack@@ er on the chest , then twist the gun from its grip before moving backwards and direc@@ ting the weapon to it .
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it pre@@ tends to Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
but remember that with a rob@@ ber@@ y it is the saf@@ est time to transfer your money - unless you are a Grand Master .
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a travel guide his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and the reflex of a serious test - by li@@ cking down some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the moder@@ ator and author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k wa@@ sted his course on a euro note , a ra@@ iling on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rinse button of a draw toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system .
before the lick of each object he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but the experiment that was filmed under the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the idea to check the flus@@ hing button of a draw toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely re@@ pul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink .
on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health .
fortunately nothing left what he de@@ filed , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth .
Mr. W@@ right was known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by traveling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things .
from public funds to stations up to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task definitely presented his immune system under a test
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; As a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the film he was justified in any case .
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his pro@@ ofs showed a lumin@@ ometric speed of more than 4000 units .
in comparison , the lumin@@ ometric speed of freshly washed hands is less than 60 .
but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to check after their lumin@@ ometric speed was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60 .
Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; who shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve been talking about in a toilet . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is nothing more dirty than that !
I will not leak here because it is disgu@@ sting inside .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr. Vali@@ os Senior Venice president for snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot; &quot; &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ bio@@ tics .
we carried crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended with saying &quot; Let &apos;s call Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon
instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system .
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had ta@@ sted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet which is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others in which this was quite difficult .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am glad we recorded some of these fil@@ thy treats on film . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria , in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria .
social Family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ing social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
a social family left her social housing after a del@@ o@@ gation with a loss of £ 50,000 , because she had terrori@@ zed her neighbors .
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall .
after they were for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , shock@@ ed employees of the housing cooperative had the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state .
the walls had holes , wood panels were pil@@ ed up , rub@@ b@@ ish was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated on the walls .
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ vo@@ y , who works for the house management of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eb@@ alls , in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ kers and cur@@ ses .
Skel@@ on , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , had an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior in June .
in some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found
in the estate where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were pil@@ ed up
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ o@@ unded her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily train .
the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ cs were che@@ ered by facilit@@ ated neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of them said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; They were afraid of no one . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we couldn &apos;t sleep this morning . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
now , where they are finally away , it will be nice .
Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have contracted the family to cooperate with local authorities .
the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years .
on the over@@ grown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant has agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family because a del@@ oc@@ ation is always the last step into consideration of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible .
I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have provided us with the information .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 .
a dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gation on the floor
workers in house management will now have to swe@@ ep away garbage mountains surrounding the house
in 2014 , the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as gar@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 .
Skel@@ on received a fine , after ow@@ ning itself to the property of a drug of class B in commercial intent .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 .
after they were without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh .
many of the house walls of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say they are del@@ o@@ ding ten@@ ants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row from the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police announced that the del@@ oc@@ ation was a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants who did not stick to the house rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without blame , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behaviour , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate any criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to cooperate with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal stag@@ ger@@ ed after an eff@@ lu@@ ent military jet over@@ flies the beach
sun wor@@ ship@@ pers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force placed an unbelievable drop in flight
the Air Force showed that it was on a training flight , but insist@@ ed that there was no safety hazard .
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a pep@@ per@@ ing jet cras@@ hes over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military plane flew almost in close proximity to the sun wor@@ ship@@ pers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers j@@ umped up when they were understand@@ ably starting to worry about the noise of the demons , without first seeing what came to them through the clouds .
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted video about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in social media , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane falling down on me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify the fishing boats off the coast and had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them .
the speaker said the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to bad visibility due to bad visibility conditions , but the air forces insist@@ ed that safety at no time was at risk .
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland , where also four people on the island Madeira came to death .
the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - strong fog and smoke smoke - which restricted his vision .
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify the fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - The FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup in front of the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash three days later at Camp No@@ u .
the Dou@@ ble@@ gew@@ inner needs to do without the under@@ stated Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reig@@ ning Europa League champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who cont@@ ests the Olympic football tournament with Brazil .
also , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
the German suffered a change in the knee in the training , with which the en@@ quiry at Bar@@ ca was clari@@ fied at least for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo .
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
coach Luis En@@ rique refra@@ ined from making a clear decision in this respect and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applicants .
before the first mandatory play of the new season , the Spanish Master has doubts about the fitness level of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool at 0 : 4 .
Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince with S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday at 3 : 2 in the trial of S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday .
Sevilla , again , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after prolon@@ gation in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph in the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
with up to now eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this race .
Ma Long in its own league of table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro .
the World R@@ ank@@ est first won the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tournament and just Olympia .
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Miz@@ ut@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it as expected in the final game and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time a Chinese would fet@@ ch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
the last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them .
they had withdrawn on the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mat@@ ches until now I have played for my country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
gold and silver med@@ alists posed with the China banner after the game .
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he determined the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points .
the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma did not develop the expected intoxic@@ ating match .
but nevertheless there were plenty of breathtaking ball changes to be seen .
Miz@@ ut@@ ani won the Bronze game against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
in his quarter final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing had a ri@@ b injury , followed by medical treatment , &quot; ultimately &quot; had to settle with sheet metal .
by the way , the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Pers@@ son ( 42 / 2008 ) have become Olympic @-@ fourth in similar high @-@ table tennis .
Donald Tr@@ ump ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems &quot; in the election campaign
the leadership of the US Republi@@ cans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states to lose their majority .
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has now short@@ com@@ ings of his campaign in the former republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ old U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the multi @-@ track and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire expressed as little as concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside his own republi@@ can camp from the race , doubts about his success are growing in the battle for the White House .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump to evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
guilt was wrong reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he res@@ um@@ ed his well @-@ known media sho@@ ot@@ ings .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds cris@@ p
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for Republi@@ cans .
according to a survey conducted by surv@@ ey@@ ors from June , Tr@@ ump and his competi@@ tor were equ@@ alled by the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton .
other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance usual for Republi@@ can candidates in the state .
Arizona and Georgia are regarded as endangered .
in an interview with the CN@@ BC broad@@ ca@@ ster , Tr@@ ump answers the question of how he wants to stop Clinton &apos;s advance : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and if afterwards : this will &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; be successful either , or I will make a very beautiful , long vacation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he makes nothing different to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; tell the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , &quot; said Tr@@ ump .
then I return to a very good way of life .
according to press reports , the party should have threatened Tr@@ ump to submit funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey values .
instead , the candidates of the Republi@@ cans should be stronger under the arms of the Congress .
Olympics : triple sc@@ ams in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to establish a disciplinary committee in the event .
after the second dop@@ ing affair , Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened with the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer home .
the International Olympic Committee would immediately set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
a Ken@@ yan officials told that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , had sent a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ meter runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch in the Olympic village .
this was reported to the team leader of Kenya by dop@@ ing controllers .
the IA@@ AF world association has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an assessment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated in an IA@@ AF explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch , sent and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; said Kenya Head of Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i .
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete , who stood on the list of training controls of the World @-@ Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Ro@@ ti@@ ch had become a World Cup fourth over 800 meters in 2015 .
four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation headed by Michael Ro@@ ti@@ ch was withdrawn from the Rio Olympics .
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested at his return at the Nairobi airport .
Kenya has been under special observation during the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing contracts since a long time .
at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing @-@ target controls presented by the IO@@ C before the Rio Olympics , it was usually pointed out beforehand that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are targeted .
the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics commen@@ ced .
as a consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules .
Kenya is regarded as a large runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that Dop@@ ing agents are easily accessible in Kenya and there is to be a considerable ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ ting .
the IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had recru@@ ited it in the Russian athle@@ tics industry .
it has been proven that in this sport species was systematically and systematically reduced .
Russian athletes were subsequently excluded from the summer games .
&quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Shakespeare @-@ Jahr &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic love pair , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled herself with the role of Maria a youth room .
in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gust@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he he@@ ats .
we always say that she is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria .
she rec@@ alls with melanch@@ oly to her favour@@ ites with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Maria has always fascinated me .
firstly because it is musi@@ cally exceptional !
and then Mary &apos;s personality would be .
she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
so she &apos;s smart , naturally also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passion@@ ately .
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , whom I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli .
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor for us to work with her .
she is a very generous person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
one sees it in each of his movements , in his looks , it is his life !
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , that is very important at all !
&quot; &quot; &quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ er@@ tori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them .
they are the same subjects , and they are as meaningful as they were then .
59 years later , the piece is still relevant .
London school@@ girl who joined the IS , was killed in Syria
K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , re@@ port@@ edly died in Syria .
the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family learned about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria .
it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ werk of the group in the country , I@@ TV News reported on Thursday .
sul@@ ana was 17 years old and died shortly after her family had been left to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said .
in February 2015 , Sult@@ ana and two other school girls from the east of London went to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border .
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was informed that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says that Clinton will stay as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election winner in Gar@@ land
Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the demo@@ crats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate Jud@@ ge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land to the Supreme Court .
the Republi@@ cans in the Senate have blocked the US confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Conn@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Jud@@ ge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that he expects from Clinton to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; choose &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
gar@@ land is the Supreme Court of the US Court of App@@ eals for the District of Columbia .
RAID said that Republi@@ cans were the nom@@ ination of the Gar@@ lands , were lack@@ eys and heroes of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump .
he also noted that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
Tre@@ ats wants nude calendar for women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere to bring out Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 .
at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his naked magazine of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys distinguishes itself as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently , it is the view that the calendar also does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classic n@@ udi@@ ty , where both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to publish the calendar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kur@@ dish church reck@@ ons with mass flight
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the president of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un .
the Kur@@ dish community of Germany reck@@ ons with tens of thousands of asylum seek@@ ers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the medium term , it could even &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; become a few hundred thousand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; believes the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
due to the harsh approach of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ dish community of Germany expects a mass flight to Germany .
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand protection seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the &quot; World &quot; Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of Friday .
because the government had already crossed Kur@@ dish stron@@ gh@@ olds with criminal actions before months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds are fle@@ eing within Turkey .
after the tur@@ mo@@ il put@@ sch , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks would still be added .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it cannot be that a state , which receives refugees , produces refugees in its own country , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the band lam@@ ented the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kur@@ dish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities .
thus Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the outlet pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are the last large minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradi@@ cated or exp@@ elled in the last hundred years , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group leader requested that the federal government was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its supporters . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also in Germany there is a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
in recent months I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists .
the fire marking as Gü@@ len follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t suit himself and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , president of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot;
as the newspaper reports on the figures of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks already put the largest group of asylum @-@ holders recognised because of political persecution in Germany before the coup .
on the reporting date June 30 , this was 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as a asylum seek@@ er ( 3@@ 9,@@ 6@@ 25 ) .
in this survey there are not those who are fle@@ eing from war , poverty , or lack of perspective .
the right of asylum according to the Basic Law is exclusively political , i.e. by the state side , individually persecuted .
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it w@@ akes &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the tourists from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by 2021 , the Parliament election will not take place right at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for more stupid than now does not work : summer holidays , heat and land elections - that bit@@ es .
the locals , who are to be convinced by the election champ@@ ions , are on vacation .
most vac@@ ation@@ ers on the island , on the island of Use@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not local people , so they are not allowed to choose the day of the country .
there are practical problems : during the holidays hel@@ pers who hang posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and end voices , only lab@@ ori@@ ously apply .
until 4 September 2016 , the election day and the last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass the election campaign to the people .
the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun .
and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a coalition of SPD / CD@@ U , must be afraid of his ministry .
the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in poll@@ s clearly behind the CD@@ U .
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition du@@ sting .
Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign , one sees from his big posters .
he travels across the country , distri@@ butes ro@@ ses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff also did .
otherwise , seaf@@ aring has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the blo@@ oming of the Af@@ D .
&quot; &quot; &quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We create this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will presumably cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the CD@@ U , with its leading candidate , the Minister of Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time .
she has twice invited chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale demonstrations ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east .
but the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it &apos;s a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel .
apart from that , the Nor@@ theast @-@ CD@@ U refra@@ ins from the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this , so Kok@@ ert thinks , plays a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; subordin@@ ate role &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Union has also noticed that in the country it is crum@@ bling the base that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any place in the expan@@ se of the country .
the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert to his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; they must go where they are , where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
because much is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to become a particularly committed campaign .
in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) .
in 2011 , the SPD had won a clear 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent share in front of the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
the Gre@@ ens , small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag .
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and spend their election campaign largely on the internet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; online election campaign , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the president Claudia Müller . &quot; &quot; &quot;
otherwise green voting champ@@ ions embar@@ k on the search for local voc@@ abul@@ aries among the vac@@ ation@@ ers .
Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , cur@@ v@@ t just with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg L@@ akes and finds it even beautiful .
&quot; &quot; &quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; election holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 Ren@@ ov@@ ation : restaurants suffer from block@@ age
there is nothing to complain about at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
for those responsible for the construction work starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and ending at 8 p.m. there are all praise .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they have made everything very sh@@ ak@@ y , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet fuel station . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
at the beginning of the weekend , the construction site could be reloc@@ ated to the south according to plan , until the end of October everything should be finished .
the reci@@ proc@@ ity of those responsible for the construction works is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation facilities .
since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the block of the asphalt road in Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rot@@ tenburg has been restored , the traffic situation within the location relax@@ es .
the citizens can now move from Of@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 on both sides .
the ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the deputy chief manager Florian King responsible for the transport management of the rehabilitation project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many cre@@ eping roads were looking for and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the signs .
what led to the fact that some trucks were fra@@ yed in residential areas .
since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality increasingly called for the trade fair vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen .
&quot; there were considerable exagger@@ ations , &quot; says King , who made himself know@@ led@@ geable about the situation .
two to three per minute have already been heated .
the fastest was on the way at 77 km per hour in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
since the construction site has been moved on , it has become qui@@ eter .
for business people at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ tenburg now the road is open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
but that the B 27 refur@@ bish@@ ment has led to sales revenue for them lets anyone looking through .
however , some are more and some less affected .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who have less to do with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Thomas Sul@@ z also speaks of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; maximum slight drop &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the deal@@ er@@ ship Ma@@ ier , but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the running not@@ ch is missing . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the most powerful are the local spots along the street .
J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Krone , finds clear words .
that is already exist@@ ential threat .
not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot;
the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil .
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the sales revenue is based on &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the road drawing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; threw his farm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; back two years ago . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he had to dis@@ miss half of his employees .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed , politics would have re@@ acted differently .
instead , government president Jörg Schmidt on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , answered with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they must also bear the disadvantages that result in the refur@@ bish@@ ment .
G@@ öh@@ ner knows about other districts where something has been handled more generous .
for all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history .
that other regular guests are now less frequently looking past due to the complicated traffic management , he can understand .
if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful .
G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about the fact that his stem @-@ client@@ ele comes back at the end of the restoration work .
despite the crises with BSE and avian influ@@ enza , G@@ öh@@ ner is holding the effects of the B 27 construction work on its client@@ ele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long @-@ standing history .
six months of construction work , this is already brutal .
in the name of the fight against terrorism , laws are constantly screwed into laws .
after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Ma@@ izi@@ ère now presents a thick security package .
but what has a di@@ re state to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Ma@@ izi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iler .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Minister of the Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anybody .
others , further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I am also involved in this .
as Minister of the Interior , however , he was placed on results and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition .
after the recent attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère took a little time before he presented his conclusions on security in the Republic .
but these are all the more extensive .
some are already known , proc@@ laim@@ s , proc@@ laim@@ s : that a new security authority is supposed to take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also , it is not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU targets on passenger data and weapons law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security authorities is also not surprising .
in part , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is starting a second run for proposals that had not been made with the SPD : he wants to put sympathy advertising for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he still considers this to be reasonable and doesn &apos;t demand anything that the coalition partner does not have any chances anyway .
a few new ideas also present de Ma@@ izi@@ ère .
some of them have in themselves : he plans rapid procedures for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for det@@ aining people from deportation .
refugees that are targeted in the country should check their smartphones before and open social media accounts for a security check .
in the case of D@@ ul@@ ties for rejected asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some even worse than to date - such as commit crimes or disc@@ ard their papers consciously in order to disgu@@ ise their identity .
some of these are politically and legally conv@@ ul@@ sions .
some of them have also been rest@@ less and are open to questions .
and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of memory - for example - the question arises : what has this to do with security and terror ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes , de Ma@@ izi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
in addition , in view of the high refugee numbers , many people worried about security .
and things that people deeply employed were not allowed to clas@@ h at election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice .
then attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
and yes , there are elections .
the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of inner security .
in the past few days , it was between the two parties high .
only a gar@@ chy dispute about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a departure from dual citizenship .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère is also ti@@ ring here about con@@ cili@@ atory sounds .
he has nothing to stop from a double pass .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it , don &apos;t make sense .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he had constitutional obj@@ ections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , it only has to be shown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is a lot of things to worry about .
but the SPD is also trying to stand out on the subject of inner security .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Part@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel first sign@@ alizes carefully and says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Volkswagen is still running gli@@ m@@ pf@@ lich .
in spite of diesel ski@@ ds , the delivery numbers rise worldwide .
but it is not running in all markets .
in the recall action there is vor@@ tex around a term .
Volkswagen will start out in the second half of the year with deliveries .
despite the diesel aff@@ aires , Europe &apos;s largest autom@@ aker can further advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets .
but in July the core brand VW was weak@@ ening especially in Western Europe and thus bur@@ dened the total sales again , as the company announced in the D@@ ax .
worldwide , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month .
in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month .
in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth .
brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July mainly to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; changed economic framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in some core markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um was also bur@@ dened by the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman .
in the USA , where the exhaust gas first escal@@ ated , a minus is also available .
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
overall , the princip@@ ally affected local brand of Lower Saxony is further gli@@ mm@@ ing through the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only a drop @-@ out minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is available .
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler continued to present a sales platform from January to July .
Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide .
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust system .
in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million wag@@ ons for conversion into the workshops .
in the course of retro@@ fitting VW , VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects .
after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine power .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after converting a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; certificate to the customer after conversion , I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as promised on Friday in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason for this is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now providing its German customers with a guarantee of re@@ charged diesel models . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
from the ministry of transport it was confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has fully met the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA Commission . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deviations are not accepted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion and all relevant vehicle values will remain unchanged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with the long term &quot; guarantee &quot; Volkswagen is able to see that for example half a year after the conversion , customers will have to go into a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it .
also in customer interest it is important to avoid that in any other damage that has nothing to do with the rejection sc@@ andal , uncertainty concerning possible warranty regulations comes as it was called .
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands criminal interest from rich savers in future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bank boss Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are only 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of an individual case and sees no signal in it : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; normal savers need not fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deposit banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent penalty interest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this fee demands the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank G@@ mund starting September of private and corporate customers for deposits of over 100,000 euros on deposit or day money accounts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next 100,000 will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Paul said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for some time he has covered 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent of costs , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bank boss . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot pay for every million 4000 euros . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs now continue .
leaving the cash simply in the Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank counter@@ s would be much too dangerous : &quot; I &apos;ve already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t like the fifth one ! &quot; said the bank .
most customers would have understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the co @-@ operative association of Bavaria said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy course causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
to carry it alone , &quot; economically it is not possible economically . &quot;
some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or bank transfers .
the Thurin@@ gian folk and Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land with its Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 had head@@ lines with pen@@ al interest for deposits starting from three million euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Managing Director of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay cover charges for deposits , and the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a ban@@ ker said at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a client@@ ele endowed with wealth a little more luxuri@@ ant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this can become a problem for a small bank &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if it &apos;s free of charge . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Association of Bavaria &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which calculate a compensation for in@@ soles of private customers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the President of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken und Rai@@ ff@@ eisen@@ banken ( B@@ VR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into neg@@ ativity towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;

destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle ages love plates .
before moving to the comment section to re@@ consider it under the pseud@@ onym of non @-@ Alle@@ en@@ ame Men of Middle Ages with harsh insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data .
according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ lication of sound plates discussed is not based on a boom in m@@ illenni@@ als who want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to lead back to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia .
those who recently bought a record are all fores@@ ight after the age between 45 and 54 .
in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers .
it is also not a hormone from hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers rather retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest gray suit and stum@@ ble wil@@ dly before I stand , hold my hands and talk a bit more intimate like : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so , let &apos;s take a look at it .
even though the heart of Soh@@ os is slowly losing its charm - Hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings in which once independent vendors have been resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores .
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observing .
Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , which I &apos;m from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of data : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours .
is he a collector , I ask ?
&quot; I guess already , &quot; he says .
I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates .
these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress up the walls of his living room .
the reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and sing@@ les is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and broke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and would like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot .
this is my vice .
WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers whom he meets will apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile .
he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pump , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and get to buy back their old records .
from the conversations that I have led , people have generally been deprived of their collection in 1998 or 1999 .
customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records again , &quot; he says .
this would explain the boom of fans of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a so@@ othing community of like @-@ minded people .
according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers received an impet@@ us to the cont@@ ac@@ tless payment system .
some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of familiar record covers , from objects to aw@@ aken happy youth memories .
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of empt@@ iness or pos@@ sessions of material pos@@ sessions as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; WE@@ Z says .
this is the case with me as a collector , and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a staff fle@@ es from a panel stack . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet .
the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player .
at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried , while I smo@@ other a pile of Bos@@ sa nov@@ a comp@@ il@@ ations .
Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( number of data : three middle aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Revi@@ val .
&quot; someone just recently came here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own record players , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says .
this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens .
more productive , less music @-@ class .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have people who say : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no record player . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are younger people , not older ones , who are only slowly coming in .
pit stop , which has devoted almost an entire floor to the sound plates , has a b@@ lower audience than I am in .
there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women .
even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ ast &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ ed pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ens out of loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ ive mental trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds .
E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of panels available for sale .
she rather makes a window mannequ@@ in than a wholesale purchase .
she doesn &apos;t earn much , therefore collecting records is not a real option , she says .
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of records is ... &quot; she drives away with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
while I am trying to sample the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls group@@ ing around Polar@@ oid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a cros@@ ley record player .
on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection .
no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them .
it is pure &quot; panel art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain .
it is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates .
even though my research shows that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , leave un@@ considered the large numbers of female collectors who exist in reality , record stores and online forums .
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
they don &apos;t spend their Thursday morning with security with a stroll through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates while they avoid the star@@ ing view of an unc@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old fake pres@@ enter , who rises above the shoulders of any middle @-@ aged men .

French Court re@@ jects offer on demoli@@ tion of transactions in the jungle refugee camp
a French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle where thousands of refugees live .
during a court hearing this week , the authorities argued in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops where individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dresser services or to sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants .
the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would lodge a risk of fire and health .
humanitarian groups shared the Court that shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp .
they also assumed that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the exp@@ ul@@ sion of people who run the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people living &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that the areas offer calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
one of the places threatened by the tear@@ ing was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos;@@ Café of the camp , which is operated in char@@ itable ways and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes , as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp .
more than 17@@ 0,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos;@@ Café .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals during the summer .
despite Olympics dis@@ appointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to get enter@@ tained .
&quot; I keep the World Cup at a glance , remain confident and fight , &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook .
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place in the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is really hard for me to comment on the passing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he must analyse in quiet@@ ness what reasons led to the de@@ bac@@ le .
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the time @-@ time championship in Qatar in October .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I will look at everything that we have changed over the past few years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this also includes my position , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote the three @-@ time world champion , who had lost more than three minutes on Wednesday at the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;

watching other people watching video games is a huge success - Microsoft also wants to benefit from it .
the technology company bu@@ ys the start @-@ up Be@@ am , which specializes in this hobby .
Microsoft announced on Thursday how much money is flowing for the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am went to the start with his offer until January and already has more than 100,000 users .
you can watch others while playing , but also intervene .
for example , they can give players missions and face enemies as well as provide equipment .

the employees of the start @-@ up , which has its headquarters in Seattle in the US state of Washington , moved to the Microsoft Head@@ quarters in the California Red@@ mond , as Be@@ am co @-@ founder and CEO Matt Sal@@ sam@@ end@@ i shared .
this means that nothing will change for the customer by the tak@@ eover .
Be@@ am is integrated into the video games department around the Xbox Con@@ sole according to Microsoft .
the live streaming market of video games is growing rapidly .
known platforms are T@@ witch and YouTube Gaming .
T@@ witch was bought by online retailer Amazon in 2014 - for almost one billion dollars .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested , which should be particularly effective .
the fut@@ uris@@ tic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident sites where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police .
for example , on motorway construction sites or renov@@ ating bridges with temporary speed limit , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed .
however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation , the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem .
with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limits as well as transit routes by time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored .
in the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch according to the manufacturer .
so that it is not simply cl@@ um@@ ed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels in the pan and by the way also disappear into a bul@@ let @-@ proof outer shell .
in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the cameras from v@@ and@@ alism .
since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used .
foreign authorities also bl@@ amed with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year .
great Britain fet@@ ches Silver in 7 @-@ er rug@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er rug@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the finale on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 .
Fi@@ ji issued a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ backs , line @-@ run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color .
the defeat was swe@@ pt through the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa .
the marked defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back to them in the final .
but regardless of that Fi@@ ji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man @-@ team in this form .
it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for the UK - but it probably won &apos;t - at least one br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben Ry@@ an , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don .
GB had a difficult path .
eight years ago , she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing .
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and took the attacks of G@@ Bs out of fun .
it felt for the captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if they were running in running buses . the World Series winners went up 5 @-@ 0 to the top when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au lit up in the corner .
with just four minutes of playing Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner , which he converted .
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
a terri@@ fying t@@ opping from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of man Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third gate , but Fi@@ ji only stopped .
in the seventh minute of the race j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and there was 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re@@ pu@@ dent and there was still over a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u ra@@ ged through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a fool .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
it is as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB still un@@ learned .
this is how it is .
GB introduced fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for quite four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua ran through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant interim play of Fi@@ ji .
Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Se@@ an sul@@ aner , whose fans sang , flags and d@@ anced at the grand@@ stand .
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is embra@@ ced and the UK was crus@@ hing crus@@ hing in the law@@ ns .
earlier on the day Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ als match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
K@@ yle Brown pushed the bu@@ cks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a door among the posts in the second half .
a brilliant late Tac@@ kl@@ ing by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal .
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by combat with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ al gold than in those games and that will mean something .
from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard p@@ ieve that enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa .
even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was at the same time as she was the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in the tw@@ ater without a control woman in a row , the first women in the history of British sport that made such a scale .
her domin@@ ance was absolute , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter was un@@ defeated , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled .
what we see are two brilliant ath@@ let@@ ins gli@@ ding over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the kind of triumph .
behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers that make a difference to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference , and there was no assistant to any assistant than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer .
as he said he was ris@@ ky .
I had bladder cancer that is oper@@ able and they did .
if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere .
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the break down to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances .
I needed money , so I had to get better back soon .
it was an incentive .
I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough .
this is how it begins .
rowing is a challenge , but it makes it even bigger .
in the immedi@@ acy of the victory her first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ raising morning with it a little more than usual , trying to process his own fears .
&quot; &quot; &quot; p@@ anning , being a captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . that &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
without Robin we wouldn &apos;t be , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world .
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to lock up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve .
we were very caught at the moment .
Hel@@ en sum@@ mon@@ ed &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something wrong .
we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , which we did .
the couple will take time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver needs to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV @-@ advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
in London , it took about six months to conc@@ eive that I am an Olympic champion .
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
it feels so much better , &quot; she said .
31 years of exemplary care taken care of
the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian @-@ wide exemplary &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of some time in the original on a contribution by Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
a little later the water forum of the government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia appreciated the purpose of the association .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was in the prison association for 31 years , has been the managing director for 28 years .
now he retired at the age of 65 .
the water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , sponsors about 150@@ 000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 villages and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants .
the municipalities are church lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach .
water supply contracts are available for further towns and municipalities .
the current chairman , Breit@@ brun@@ ns Bürger@@ meister@@ in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the German Con@@ federation in 1988 .
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the chairman .
as an outstanding event she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchase in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ development of the elevated tank ( 1999 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renov@@ ations of water pipes .
there has been no stal@@ em@@ ate and I have always added new additions , because water is life and drinking water is the most important food .
in her speech she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service for over 31 years .
he has set himself up with a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he has been regularly living the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
a few weeks ago he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group to the nit@@ rate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia region .
for that he received very much recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , on the one hand , praised water@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water man and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
as highlights from his point of view , he described the construction of the fountain and the restructuring of the purpose association .
but the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the pipe break at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ lou@@ der on a 3rd of January .
here , at minus 17 degrees we had to work throughout the night , so that the villages could be supplied with water .
one can only maintain the supply of Neu@@ brunn , because you filled the container from P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succe@@ eds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the man himself called and told us to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him I am publicly tra@@ m@@ pled .
now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road by car .
the man is about 1,80 meters large , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald .
meanwhile , the police have published a photo of him .
however , it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a bald head .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon in himself , like the police .
who sees Sven S. is supposed to call the 110 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police speak of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; relationship of relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the victim was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ r@@ ator 1981 .
at first the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to make any information about the perpet@@ r@@ ator or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but it confirmed that a human being had been killed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; more we don &apos;t say at this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special command mand@@ o ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime .
steel - Licht@@ blick for the Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions .
financial bur@@ dens threatened by the industry from the extraction of green electricity are from the table .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Tran@@ sition in the existing installations for so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday edition ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we could finally achieve this after two years of tough negotiations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the European Commission therefore initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption .
according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year .
Gabriel told WA@@ Z that there is now a certificate with the European Commission for talks with Com@@ miss@@ ary Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ elling of 20 percent is possible .
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for Electri@@ city Production .
as a result , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; steel is future &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; campaign this is a first step . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; even in the reform of emissions rights trade , climate and employment goals are weigh@@ ed down , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year , the situation escal@@ ated further , when the world &apos;s largest producer in China threw down steel on the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand .
European manufacturers reject price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel companies .
in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed .
on the one hand imported import duties show effects on import steel , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up .
it is uncle@@ ar how sustainable the price collection is .
the German industry leader Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp continued to be cau@@ tious on Thursday .
last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again .
the sector respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Kru@@ pp also did not want to exclude closure of individual works .
around 8@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders .
at 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the Steel Business Unit announced on Friday .
after a short up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment in May , the produced amount went back to one another for the second month .
since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure .
in the coming months , the Association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output .
community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors well
S@@ ingen has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp as her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir . she studied music in the school choir , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir .
&quot; singing inspir@@ es me emo@@ tionally and physically , &quot; she describes .
after a rehear@@ sal she feels balanced , cheerful and a whole more lively , she says .
by the way , she does something good for her health and her spirit .
because singing is a great hobby for senior citizens from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the German Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga .
most senior citizens sing in choir and share with like @-@ minded the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler .
through regular encounters , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
because often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so , sen@@ iors exercise a deep and controlled breathing .
if you regularly urge your lungs , don &apos;t get out of the pu@@ ffs so quickly in everyday life .
even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in age , singing is an optimal hobby .
on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens .
in the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure , she explains .
L@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth .
through lyrics and especially melodies , people with dementia are sin@@ king long past events .
while singing , a special performance is required for the head , explains L@@ enz .
concentr@@ ating simultaneously on one &apos;s voice and on a given rhythm and adapting itself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
especially older people who live alone exercise not only to concentrate on themselves .
another positive aspect is the recognition that one lear@@ ns through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ este@@ em also grows through singing in the choir .
to show yourself : if I practise something for a long time , I become better and wa@@ x@@ ed beyond myself - this experience rein@@ forces .
good reasons to start singing , so there is enough .
those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks they have little talent , L@@ enz advises .
you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who can hear when there &apos;s a tone next to it ?
in search of the suitable offer , sen@@ iors have different possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler .
if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors &quot; choir , one can simply join .
many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
whoever wants to sing in an ec@@ cl@@ esi@@ as@@ tical choir can turn directly to the church or church leader .
many senior choirs can also be found via the internet .
if you don &apos;t have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help from the internet research .
anyone wanting to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler .
singing does the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react more sensitive than males to cri@@ es of young animals
bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover the effect of creating k@@ itt@@ ens on adult animals .
to their surprise , the male also didn &apos;t let the males grow cold - however , they always beha@@ ved equally in contrast to the females .
female cats can recognize the degree of exc@@ itation of cat &apos;s babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
they respond by ten percent faster to deci@@ du@@ ous k@@ itt@@ ens , who are in great need , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary Academy and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) .
males also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or of importance for the males , &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H .
she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology .
in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens cri@@ es differ with the ur@@ gency of their dependen@@ cy .
a total of nine adult males and eight females were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were pre @-@ played for a call of little ones , taken from the litter box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
on the other hand they were confronted with cri@@ es of more excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition .
the researchers keep their results in spite of the small sample for meaningful results .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; all females , even those who still have no offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they turned out faster to the loudspeaker when this rep@@ ut@@ ations of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played off .
this faculty may possibly be con@@ genital or develop@@ ped with the sexually mature .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the past , scientists have repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men to baby no@@ ises .
some studies also showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to inf@@ ants , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , the bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported .
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts to Super@@ cup with &quot; Gala &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r is a soccer legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant has been issued against the erst@@ while football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kü@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey again takes place an important football match .
in front of the du@@ el of the arch@@ ri@@ vals between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ sky Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced .
even in the case of the im@@ position of the state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government , the daily routine of normal citizens , was not affected .
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the Movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the coup attempt .
it doesn &apos;t stop before football .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r .
accordingly , the South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
Sü@@ ku@@ r is said to be the follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan .
although the state of emergency suspended for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; democracy guards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country , Erdo@@ gan has declared an end on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into tra@@ ilers and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the president &apos;s friends .
but what unites the bulk of the Turks , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at Po@@ kal@@ ei@@ eger &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be particularly on Luke Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Cologne celebrated its sporty value in the past season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory record .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy for his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record master found a con@@ cili@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after completing the rounds in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; also leave early in the Europa League . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the Sü@@ me@@ g Li@@ g , it reached rank sixth only .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have done that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ sky . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the game year was better .
thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season @-@ hits as the Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig .
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to hope for the return of the 31 year old .
at the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez bor@@ rowed under the contract and announced on Bes@@ ik@@ tas after the coup attempt not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the specialist magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the stri@@ ker would have to be ready to give up around one @-@ third of his estimated annual salary of 7.5 million euros , &quot; Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay his salary at Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als opportunities at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin was already closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ owa is not allowed to start in Rio .
other convic@@ ted athle@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for med@@ als .
the topic of dop@@ ing remains the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ ova , who had su@@ ed their starting right before the games after a lock @-@ lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly pun@@ ched and burnt out at their start ( 100 meters of chest ) .
there was a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scene : with a raised smile , she was still in the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
when it was arrested that it won &apos;t pick up gold , the audience broke out into a storm storm .
but there are numerous other athletes who go to the start of the Olympic Games in Rio despite the dop@@ ing past .
here is an overview :
Jus@@ tin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics .
he was closed twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
since its spell , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is the number one in the world over 100 meters in 9,@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t .
Shel@@ ly @-@ An@@ n F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to reti@@ re in 2010 after taking the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don .
she had had severe tooth@@ ache after surgery , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended .
Sandra Per@@ ko@@ vic ( disc@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic champion of 2012 , World Champion from 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 was tested positively on the banned stimul@@ ant medium meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine .
Per@@ ko@@ vic denied the know@@ led@@ geable intake and was closed for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin .
La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time World Champion above 400 m , was tested positive in 2010 and had been locked 21 months .
a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , controlled Mer@@ ritt .
this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m .
Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ reproach , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete had so many med@@ als subsequently recognized .
so T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
in 2004 , the 40 year old also had to hand out Olympic Silver in 2004 for ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the Euro title in 2006 for testosterone abuse .
he also received the recognized bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games because of a judgment of the International Sports Court .
at 8@@ 0,@@ 04 m , he ranks second in the world ranking .
Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record scientist and Gold@@ fav@@ ori@@ tin was tested positive only in May but may nevertheless start in Rio .
in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , references were found for taking a banned dietary supplement , the lock of the World Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA was mil@@ dly de@@ pl@@ eted and ran already on July 13 .
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
the Austrian Embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning .
she had suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital but had already left it .
she planned her home trip at the beginning of September .
whether the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ uk@@ et as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon are also Austrian citizens , it is still uncle@@ ar .
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll .
Hu@@ a H@@ in , located approximately 200 kilometres south of Bangkok &apos;s capital , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening .
according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans .
Friday morning , two explo@@ sions went up again and another man was killed according to the authorities .
also from Ph@@ uk@@ et , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
a taxi driver was injured during the det@@ on@@ ation near the beach town of Pat@@ ong , which was popular with tourists .
in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country another bomb explo@@ ded which killed an urban employee .
according to the authorities , the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police .
finally , there were several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon on the south @-@ east coast several wounded .
it was said that there was a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee , Friday morning before journalists . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is too early to express himself to possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels .
Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bom@@ bing of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks would not be related to the Islam@@ ist insurrection or international terrorism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which is limited to restricted areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead , one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military j@@ un@@ ta .
in recent days the authorities would have received intelligence evidence of im@@ min@@ ent attacks in the south of the country - however , they would not have been informed of the exact time and places .
it is still uncle@@ ar which group is behind the attacks .
the police used their officials throughout the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment areas .
in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are mostly not directed against tourists .
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
after the alleged bom@@ bing explo@@ sions , the Austrian Foreign Ministry strongly recommends its website to follow the instructions of Thai security agencies .
high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its surroundings .
after clas@@ hes between the security forces and the Muslim populations , it is not necessary to de@@ file the necessary vo@@ y@@ ages in these provinces .
increased safety risk ( Level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military j@@ un@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence even in the years to come .
Jun@@ ta chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism .
the military un@@ ta , who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , is able to keep the kingdom back to stability and order .
however , the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years .
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
just a year ago , 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack in the recent history of the country .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the right &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identi@@ fiable movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has become the visor of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after several state offices , the constitu@@ tion@@ ers in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we see the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; points for efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Security Officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate at the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thus immigrants of Islamic faith or the Middle East are becoming more and more diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways .
that is why we are now observing the movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots active in Germany since 2012 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
constitutional rights activists in nine federal states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already .
Ma@@ ate said that his authority was closely coordinated with the authorities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; groups like the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; are trying to pick up their target group where they stand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music .
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an embarrass@@ ing advertisement for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emo@@ tionally .
young people are in a special way vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; &quot; &quot; last but not least , several federal states had given reports on contacts of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ma@@ ate said he didn &apos;t have any insights .
for the protection of the Constitution , possible contacts of this species are only relevant from a certain point .
it depends on whether the respective party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their target direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist .
the decisive factor here is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not identi@@ fiable .
with a view to the significant increase in legal @-@ motivated off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugees , Ma@@ ate said that in this connection he would not speak of new right terrorism .
but in recent years we have found that there can be legitimate structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ taler group .
it may well be that further right @-@ wing groups or small groups form , plan the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee he@@ wers or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives .
however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide control of legal terrorism is not identi@@ fiable .
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried Ma@@ ate expressed his concern that many attacks went to the account of people who previously did not appear in the right scene .
this is the cause of concern .
many of the susp@@ ects of attack on asylum seek@@ ers were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ender or supporters of the right scene .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts who might have been politically in@@ different or voted for example , CD@@ U , SPD or left , who would have radic@@ alized , however , by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ its Bec@@ omes an Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always the Olympic Games or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympics .
this shows the cour@@ a@@ geous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly over@@ weight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that he was no longer seen in the TV pictures .
he simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
in social networks , Hab@@ te became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old termin@@ ated his lead with a return of 48 seconds and occupied the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters .
but it was not his just sporty figure that attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries more known .
because most sports@@ men are running in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te wanted to do something different .
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; some media referred him as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ro@@ bel of the W@@ al . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prosperity b@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; made fun of him . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his time , he only struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 @-@ metre fre@@ estyle , played no part .
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention at the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 .
the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to compete with a 100 @-@ metre @-@ free style on his own .
M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

Tr@@ ump does not see the im@@ min@@ ent electoral defeat so close
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks about an election campaign in Florida .
should there be nothing with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump already has an alternative video .
he then goes on holiday .
if Donald Tr@@ ump lo@@ oses the US presidential election in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it won &apos;t work , or I have a very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US television broad@@ ca@@ ster CN@@ BC .
if it does not suff@@ ice for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is al@@ right , said Tr@@ ump .
so he called US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) .
in his party , more and more resistance formed itself .
post rises in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the mail plans to sell your electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter .
shortly , the Group intends to start trading with the transpor@@ ter .
the mail wants to offer its electric v@@ ans from the next year on the free car market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to enter into the sale to third parties , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a post spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the company has been testing for months whether they will sell their self @-@ developed road sco@@ oter , with letters and pack@@ ets , also to sell to other companies .
post @-@ Executive Board Jürgen Ger@@ der had said there are repeat@@ ed@@ ely ques@@ tioning , for instance by craftsmen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group wants to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in post @-@ proprietary manufacturing , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift .
Ger@@ ald had announced that the Group would significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and in the long run make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will make a very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .

GF@@ RP management ki@@ cks off after dis@@ ap@@ pointing results
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the revers@@ es suddenly came - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K made sense that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann becomes even more uncertain the longer the achievements promised by him .
turbul@@ ence at the head of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after renewed dis@@ ap@@ pointing results and the resig@@ nation of the company management , the worldwide number five of the industry is facing a new beginning .
the G@@ RP CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Grin@@ ert , already resig@@ ns from the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September .
the leadership in the Management Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger on 1 September , divided the company .
he is to officially take over the function of a &quot; spokes@@ man &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the company called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business strategy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
details wanted a company spokes@@ man on Friday not to name .
who will be the market research company in future , is still uncle@@ ar at this time .
on Friday , at the shareholders it was said to have been the dis@@ appointment of the continued successes of the restructuring initiated several years ago .
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , are not yet to be seen after 5 years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in view of the recent bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder at some point will become rest@@ less at some point .
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said .
following set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not have to stop its losses in the second quarter of 2016 .
at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent lower than the previous year &apos;s previous year .
in the first half of the year , sales of 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million euros shr@@ unk by 3.4 percent .
the profit in the second quarter was above all imp@@ acted by the s@@ unken value of the company in view of its difficult economic situation .
the company depreci@@ ation amoun@@ ting to EUR 139 million in the Consumer Experience Business Unit generated a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million to the Group under the line .
in the second quarter of 2015 , Gf@@ K generated a net profit of 19.@@ 7 million .
accidents - Bus sli@@ ps into kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n in tren@@ ches : eight wounded
in an accident of a coach with 43 senior citizens , eight people were injured in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) on Thursday .
two of the in@@ mates suffered serious injuries , shared the police .
the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her information , had to ev@@ ade a coming truck , which partly drove on the opposite course .
the bus stopped right from the road and sli@@ d into a tren@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus independent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liber@@ ated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene on the state road 2 .
the un@@ injured travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators demanded the load experience and possible witnesses to report to the police .
the fees for each cubic metre of waste water will be 2.@@ 10 euros for the area of the Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 sewage plant from October 1 , 2016 ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) .
at the facility in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater charge will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary .
after a rough calculation , the waste water price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter .
as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , at the approval of the budget by the Land@@ rats@@ amt Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that under@@ cover installations are running for these wastewater facilities .
due to legal foundations , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost @-@ effectively .
from October 1 , 2016 , citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to step deeper into the pur@@ se .
the fee increases between 48 and 67 percent .
as Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the Board , a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary .
over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over and / or overl@@ app@@ ings from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated .
the serious increase in fees prompted Schmidt that there were relatively small facilities in all three sewage installations with a very low waste water attack , which was between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year .
due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact .
furthermore , the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly dec@@ lining .
furthermore , in the rec@@ umbent cycle period of all three plants , refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses were incurred not least due to their age of refur@@ bish@@ ment and repair expenses .
the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for World Sports , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years .
Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the Az@@ endorf sewage plant .
the pump station Wel@@ sch@@ ahl had to be over@@ hau@@ led by the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems and , after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage pond had to be exp@@ elled , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of and an additional aer@@ ation facility had to be installed in order to meet the water @-@ legal requirements in the future .
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in continued maintenance and maintenance costs , which must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
the same applies to electricity costs , which were still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 .
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants the expendi@@ tures for the operation and maintenance were &quot; fully sm@@ ashed . &quot;
in doing so , Schmidt , who had spar@@ ed the market community of great entertainment costs for sewage installations in the past 20 years .
according to stone houses , the situation for the aforementioned installations will continue to remain prec@@ arious , especially since the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al wastewater utility association is not to be expanded because of its lack of facilities .
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % have been posted .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 1,@@ 0@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % .
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) .
prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) .

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ised
Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some ob@@ servers say that it is in@@ sensitive to breeds .
with its filter tool Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identi@@ ties in such a way that already borders the absur@@ dity .
you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting .
the filters are un@@ bl@@ ended , self @-@ prop@@ elled tools generating more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day .
all mis@@ carri@@ ages get to the public .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have critic@@ ised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app of Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
when this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them s@@ lit eyes , false teeth and blo@@ ated che@@ eks , some critics named a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot;
they wonder@@ ed if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
the news and ou@@ trage were widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mo@@ ther@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat told that it would have turned off the feature .
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as carto@@ on by Asi@@ ans .
but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced ra@@ cism reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és .
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread over the photos , was that the filter was &quot; vulnerable and easy to say . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradic@@ tory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
it shows that the filter is not safe , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the cutting extreme .
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural tri@@ bun@@ es .
the American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand .
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity .
if one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday .
on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same .
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that ra@@ cial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices of Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the partially white , only male leadership and ended up with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it . &quot;
others share their opinion , a complaint that Sn@@ ap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered .
the company publishes no figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
on Thursday Sn@@ ap@@ chat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company has recently hired a personnel responsible , focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts .
Z@@ hu also said that she will leave her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS secret service information , establishes committee of con@@ gresses
military members of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions on the ground had allowed , a committee of inquiry in a report on Thursday reported .
the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the armed forces , secret service commis@@ sions and military budget comp@@ mit@@ es , reports of great dis@@ content among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments of the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State .
the Central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia .
&quot; intelligence @-@ related information , which were typically ero@@ ded by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on @-@ site were allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said K@@ en Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the leadership errors in the Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports , it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their heads to draw an optim@@ istic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements in front of the congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , a Cent@@ Com member announced publicly that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could start in April or May 2015 .
Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after months of investigations , it is so clear . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ p@@ ei@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ s@@ man from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , Central Command has changed its intelligence reports to play the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq .
the Republi@@ cans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations are being continued .
in addition , further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defense Ministry .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee publicly published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; announced the highest level of demo@@ cra@@ t in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this process , Mr. Schiff , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the moral under analysts and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clu@@ es to the intervention of the White House on the Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s Chief In@@ spec@@ tor , who was taken up after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts .
C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , gave a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress , while the investigations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor were still underway .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but he also admitted that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the investigations have revers@@ ed the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions .
the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminiscent of disputes over ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a letter about how the then government under George W. Bush envis@@ aged only a small occup@@ ying force in Iraq and had little time pre@@ ten@@ ding to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 .
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the revol@@ t against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
last year , Mr. Hoo@@ ker &apos;s team stated that contrary to the government &apos;s statements , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group , since these temporary refin@@ eries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market .
this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September .
Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al@@ iger commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature because of his dispro@@ portion@@ ately positive assessment of the military situation at a hearing before the Senate .
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at Central Command .
the US wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before
one day after having shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 .
five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she couldn &apos;t remember it ever done .
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I am not among the people who keep their doors in memory .
however , they know that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons at the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan .
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will take the first and second place .
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group .
as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have spark@@ ed a surprising vor@@ tex by their success story , four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games .
BA@@ M was part of this team .
she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey match in hands ( her two older sisters played sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team .
she missed the 2008 Olympics as she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engli@@ sh@@ man , trainer of the national team , began to turn things better .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have completely ri@@ pped the ru@@ dder .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gates in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash out of the close @-@ up area .
India went into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 to 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands .
she performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and le@@ aked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the US , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games .
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday .
amid the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the Tramp@@ ol@@ ines
wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympics .
the Rio de Janeiro events feel steady and inevitable , a rapid relay event between competition and aspir@@ ation .
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the w@@ rist@@ watch to a swi@@ mmer to the gym@@ n@@ ast for tri@@ athletes .
you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor &apos;s conversation in the coffee shop without hearing Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los .
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock with dimples , could have been among these well @-@ known names that are sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel @-@ good @-@ TV advertising if he would be a swi@@ mmer , gym@@ n@@ ast or even fen@@ cer .
but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines .
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
further from the centre , some in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted : air guns , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do .
we will always have the mamm@@ ary swimming and may it reign for a long time .
but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline .
although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , it was perceived as spar@@ sely the last 16 years that many people I asked was not aware of it at all an Olympic sport .
this could also be regional ignorance .
although the USA sent athletes to compete , it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and has had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round .
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their Gold Med@@ al from London this year .
the trampoline jumping has a certain out@@ sider charm , partly because it sounds more appropriate for the un@@ enligh@@ tened ear for a c@@ lown school than the one for the Olympic Games .
at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a gro@@ unded enthusi@@ ast .
it has humor@@ ous potential - the kar@@ to@@ onic trem@@ bling of its never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that it essentially combines .
the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot;
emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , ho@@ cks and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet .
they are rated according to official Olympi@@ apro@@ gram according to version , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot;
twenty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio .
the most common Olympic vector is straight ahead .
med@@ alli@@ sts in their quest for gold go further , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and down , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground .
they hunt not only the finish line or the bas@@ eline , but also another scor@@ ching goal in the transmission of television : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord .
the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir up even a spect@@ ator to tears .
but it &apos;s also what I think about watching these games as a bit ti@@ ring .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
he or she bo@@ unces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then eff@@ ort@@ lessly back up .
there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during the exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no cur@@ v@@ ature in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity .
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be .
the qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 .
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block from 14.@@ 00 on both days .
in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il .
if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the an@@ thro@@ po@@ ids and the objec@@ tification of male athletes - as the male US gym@@ na@@ sts recently beat the Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his new fan base .
&quot; one Generation Prot@@ ected &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators , calling for political changes in Ethiopia , hit the government &apos;s violent resistance .
witnesses say that many prot@@ esters have been killed during clas@@ hes with the police in shooting .
is Ethiopia just breaking together ?
over the past ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy .
but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas .
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
according to human rights organizations , the response of the government was ru@@ th@@ less .
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall .
the head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project manager of the Horn of Africa at the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
American military and intelligence agencies co@@ operate closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorists across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help .
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean .
although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the government to supp@@ ress - the opposition in the country has been restricted , with dissi@@ dents being effectively sil@@ enced .
many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven to the desert of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you op@@ press people and have no other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Se@@ j@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Africa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the entire youth protests .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gl@@ ehold on the power of the ruling coalition .
following a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament .
at the same time the tensions escal@@ ate along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line called hundreds of lives in June .
analysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , which were forced more or less in recent years , could use the turbul@@ ence and arm themselves again .
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness are now explo@@ ding under the surface after years of bit@@ ing .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved .
even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are resi@@ ding .
several young Ethiop@@ ians reported that they gathered to protests .
the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia .
the Oro@@ sei and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
since e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who are predominantly Christian high@@ lands from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while explo@@ iting the Oro@@ sei , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas .
but this is also changing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are there to co @-@ ordin@@ ate under one umbrella , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ sei . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the largest protests took place in Am@@ har@@ a and Oro@@ sei .
many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos feel that Ethiopia illeg@@ ally domin@@ ates the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics .
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was until his death in Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister until his death in 2012 .
he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners .
analysts say that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ content and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively in@@ transparent reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es .
unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the South .
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
the last time that Ethiopia has experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ esting that , according to the analysts , apparently ple@@ dged by the government and then stolen .
during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though they were less than in recent months , and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il passed relatively quickly .
development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their meas@@ urable progress in poverty reduction .
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal Miss@@ al of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous ethnic form .
last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ res@@ ic city , run by Tig@@ ray , attacked shops , and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray becomes more and more common in social media .
analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
the American government used Ethiopia as the base for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights across the neighboring Somalia , even if she recently announced that she closed this base .
while the West wants to clearly support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump says his claim Obama was founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to disper@@ se the last controversy surrounding his campaign by att@@ acking his repeated asser@@ tion that President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant .
this clari@@ fication designed new questions about the communication skills of the Republi@@ cans &apos; presidential candidates , whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
it also brings out his comrades who endeav@@ our to take care of him during an event@@ ful period of time , in the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant .
after having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Tr@@ ump resig@@ ned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insist@@ ed in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS .
but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic .
the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he thought the accus@@ ation was completely serious .
when the conservative radio @-@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump to we@@ aken the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate would not want to know about it .
the last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to ste@@ er the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again .
using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech d@@ ull .
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
at the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he said the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; Of course I thought the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans , how they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; clarify &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; according to how the reaction falls . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but I also think he &apos;s clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has accepted an even more corro@@ sive tone as his survey values have gone further . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado , and head @-@ to @-@ head races in Florida .
while Mr. Tr@@ ump is in general trying not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to mis@@ understand his hum@@ our .
but while he is stepping up in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps has brought his loyal co @-@ workers into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ atively his statements may be .
Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent advoc@@ ates , gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said he was asked to do the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them Hinter@@ b@@ än@@ kler , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq .
most mainstream Republi@@ cans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread themselves by forcing the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control .
before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of hanging around on each of his words and being prejudi@@ ced against him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; poor , mis@@ erable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps for ap@@ ology than a further proof that he was un@@ suitable for the pres@@ idency .
once pushed over the price of the market , Café gets back to Green@@ point
Ver@@ b Cafe was a damaged café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee .
of course the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store were sup@@ planted .
the business So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , who replaced the verb in the summer of 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes .
local people smo@@ ked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel exclu@@ des and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
but if New York is changing , then it is also new .
a revi@@ ved ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location .
the new club has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere .
the coffee is still good .
the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing member of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café .
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
when a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outdoor table , he was excited to do it , he said .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , retained a lot .
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ nish like cap@@ ers and sau@@ tee onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices .
after nine months Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many old customers have also been displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer .
Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in the past and visited the club regularly .
even after being drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the path .
after the club had closed , she gave up a drink for a while , she said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it became clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that I liked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she drinks coffee , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition .
since the beginning of the verb in 2003 Tom Ros@@ enthal was another long @-@ standing and loyal customer .
he went there before the work and always ordered the same .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I came fourth , every day , like a Swiss watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no res@@ ent@@ ment about the fact that the soap business had taken the old business area .
in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for Ver@@ b with the coffee of coffee in the café as an ingredient .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we will still deal with her offer , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he preferred to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome .
the location also has further advantages .
a local Saf@@ t@@ shop wants to fill and sell the coffee bre@@ w@@ ed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighbouring building .
for many customers a new verb goes out to get their old favorites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was destroyed at the ground when the cafe closed .
when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entering of the restaurant and the bark@@ ing felt a new coff@@ ees like a hom@@ ec@@ oming .
&quot; I had to smell that , &quot; he said .
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
in March 1933 , shortly after his ascension to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt received his lunch at the O@@ val Office .
as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup .
his menu on that day was a bit more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and as a dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ans .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; dealt with Chinese cuisine in the USA , while the book &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; talked about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Publishing , illustrates the history of the American kitchen during the Great Depression .
they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a repor@@ ter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sle@@ ek snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of the stock market crash in 1929 .
brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate .
when the repor@@ ter set min@@ ced meat , this found the couple suitable for a discussion about eating in the era of Great Depression .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat cheaper , which stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it must be like lead in the stomach , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet .
cre@@ ws of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked past@@ ors for breakfast , lunch and dinner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; records the ways the country was about to be no longer the land of Cock@@ aig@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new bud@@ get@@ ary was equally ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and ch@@ asser@@ oles became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole was a &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food residue , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man noted that chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce .
fresh fruit was replaced by cheap dried fruit .
meat , which was the center of the American kitchen for years , became a rare luxury .
strange bl@@ ends have been tried out as a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction had priority over taste or even common sense .
during their research for the book , which also includes recipes , bricks made a dish of this epoch , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and fried onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the basic business recipes .
as never before or since , bud@@ get@@ ary econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - looked like the country &apos;s eating habits .
by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and to transform p@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals .
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treats .
in particular , the reports about the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ ake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude .
while publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant kitchen of his kitchen , he fed as the million@@ aire man from the world to whom he became .
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said .
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was terri@@ bly realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to make an example with his stomach .
as described in the book , the announc@@ er of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors through Ms Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the land came back on the legs .
the legacy is on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science has been applied to food .
the couple admitted to the writing of the book the eating habits of bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law better - for example , how they could not throw food away .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall raid .
after the plates were swe@@ pt away at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e produced a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert , that ate President Roos@@ ev@@ elt at noon .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man and added that it was a common trick to miss a modest recipe . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon .
everybody di@@ ved a little rel@@ uc@@ t@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ amed brown gli@@ b@@ ber .
amaz@@ ingly , it ta@@ sted not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a stop .
&quot; &quot; &quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ tier@@ er he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
bomb attack killed : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died even in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
O@@ mar was a member of the White Helm@@ ets , a civil defence group that , according to the Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved nearly 6@@ 0,000 people .
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian worker , who showed him at an 11 @-@ hour rescue of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house , went around the world in 2014 .
it turned the Syrian to the shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but as a hero , he never saw himself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me this is the real ji@@ had . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I die to save lives , I think that God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria .
the helicop@@ ters have cast four barrel bombs above the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas .
a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from short@@ ness of breath .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ n@@ ants of the bomb so that children do not play with it &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the picture quoted his final words before he died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .

lei@@ surely the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the basis of the North Atlantic , in an hour it comes on average just 1,@@ 220 meters far .
only when it depends on it , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to s@@ atte 2,@@ 6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal .
this lifestyle shaped by Lang@@ samkeit appears to be a pan@@ ac@@ ea for a high age .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein from the Max Planck Institute for Dem@@ ographic Research in Rostock this life span , which represents a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist presum@@ ed that Greenland &apos;s hair would become st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard .
because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface .
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks .
her slow motion measured it , when they fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard .
the loo@@ t nevertheless makes this sh@@ arks : in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear .
they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ a@@ vers , which tor@@ to@@ l from higher water @-@ layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks , fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured .
in order to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens nucle@@ us of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method .
this centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the protein contained in it will no longer be renewed .
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons attempts to spin greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere .
in the third smallest animal with its length of 220 centimet@@ ers , the lens nucle@@ us , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , so it should have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 .
on the other hand , all larger Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ quantities in their l@@ enti@@ us , which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere .
in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ ers long Greenland shar@@ k , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers could even be 3@@ 92 years old .
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known .
now the researchers were able to associate the length of an old age .
since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ res probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks with the multip@@ lication become apparent at least one and a half centuries .
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coinci@@ dence that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ em@@ es live mainly in icy waters .
also the record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland wh@@ ale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska .
due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there frequently also runs on as@@ par@@ agus .
so they mature later - and age slowly .
in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very large .
because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein .
a very large animal should , on the other hand , invest his resources in a long life .
building site in a double pack
in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focused on issues relating to building construction .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with relief , the Board accepted the release of mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the land , par@@ cel@@ ing and closing questions were cleared and the applications could be surv@@ eyed , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; Road weg &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße - extension section 1 ) to interested parties is no longer in the way .
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau serve young families and troubled senior citizens alike .
as it was said , building volunteers can report at the town hall right away , and the municipal council is expected to consult about the allocation of plots in its September meeting .
in order to obtain further en@@ quiries about the establishment of further commercial enterprises connected with the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year .
in the Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n area , the commercial area has already been extended by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
accordingly , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to move jobs and companies reloc@@ ated from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum it is uncertain whether financial institutions can continue to operate from London on financial transactions across the EU . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , the approval in the UK is enough for them so far . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks in the Eurozone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Council ES@@ R@@ B .
in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks because they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says I@@ W Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Luxembourg holds a large fund sector , but just as Dublin deterior@@ ates in infrastructure .
thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to achieve .
further points are the city with commercial real estate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate were 50 percent higher than on the Main .
in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime .
in a ranking of the management consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city will be ranked seventh , Luxemburg on place 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place .
&quot; &quot; &quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with its strong position as a finance location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but London , despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , will remain the most important financial center in Europe , my business researchers .
the balance of power : in London , according to figures of the Landes@@ bank , Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2,500 .
Gilead gains legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a US President ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc. claims to reimbur@@ se the legal costs arising from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
in June , Gilead was exemp@@ t from damages amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which was in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster medications S@@ ov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other in@@ ethical actions .
when the complaint was filed on Thursday , US President , Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , stated that Gilead is entitled to the decree of the costs arising during the defense of the case .
Mer@@ ck tries to equ@@ ate with Gilead , which domin@@ ates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs , which can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
the case dates back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained and claimed responsibility for laboratory work , which was based on Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the medications of Gilead .
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
troops supported by the USA have reg@@ ained full control of the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters in the city left it , said a spokes@@ man for the group on Friday .
the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) are comb@@ ing after the extract of the remaining group of fighters that have buried themselves within the city .
they have liber@@ ated over 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan announced the wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters which was alli@@ ed with the D@@ KS .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just execute clean @-@ up work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the demo@@ crats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % .
in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated almost $ 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption C@@ ables ; the former Secretary of State gave an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for their book on their term of office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
Clinton &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ pres@@ idency , Sen@@ ator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton published his tax declar@@ ations over the past ten years .
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per Jen@@ ni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in stark contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ trac@@ ers regarding his previous promises to publish his tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declar@@ ations although they are not oblig@@ ated by law . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign hel@@ pers Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before tax inspections were not complete .
Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for char@@ itable organisations , his business and various other connections , especially with Russia .
Clinton had already top@@ pled on the subject and released a video on the Internet on Friday in which high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump for@@ ba@@ de to publish his tax return .
on Thursday she addressed the issue during a speech to the economy in Mich@@ igan .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he refuses to do what every other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Poli@@ tico has reported that in the 1990s Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little tax , and an economic journalist at the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that this could still be the case .
federal taxes have become a subject in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that people who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat , ex@@ changing tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax declar@@ ations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an I@@ RS tax audit and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was afraid of the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has published tax return until 2007 .
the Clin@@ tons now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqua , New York , on average paid an effective tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % .
the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that this is only a USD 100 of their income compared to the majority of Americans .
their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective index fund from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings were tax@@ ed at USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 .

con@@ doms with chil@@ i powder , fire@@ works bodies promote Tanz@@ anian elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodo@@ x way to prevent eleph@@ ants from walking in inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with chil@@ i powder .
the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had the idea for years ago , has intensified its promotion together with the U.S. natural protection by train volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non@@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without viol@@ ating animals .
previously , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves .
Friday is the international phone day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; chim@@ ney cloud &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ch@@ ill@@ i powder mixed with soil is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom , whose end is turned to the ignition cord .
when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a knob and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ill@@ i powder into the air .
a touch is usually sufficient to ch@@ ase the elephant .
a last possibility is a thro@@ wer who shoots a gold fire fire@@ works into the air and causes a loud , bright explosion .
city council unanim@@ ously decides : no ki@@ os@@ cope building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ ufer
normally , St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects from commercial occup@@ ants take part in K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - but retailers in the core city are considered to be significantly expan@@ sive .
however , the City Council rejected the request for the construction of a sale building on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine bal@@ k@@ ood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in principle , we welcome new tra@@ des@@ people , but at this location in exposed location on the banks of the Rhine , this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashing Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - RT News &quot; &quot; &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media uph@@ eav@@ al after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list the Israeli election as it had requested Arabic guests according to a staff . &quot;
Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z .
during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s list of countries .
however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room .
how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel has been eliminated and deleted ?
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center .
after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the answer he received there &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shock@@ ed him &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel staff stated that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; big shame &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we were app@@ alled and troubled by this event .
this really is very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we expect the hotel to draw &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance on the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rep@@ lic@@ ated &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the alleged demands of Arab guests . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ashamed , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was said in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is located near a synagogue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hotel quickly instructed any accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there was never a direct order &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to not take Israel into the quick election list , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it adds that the country code has now been added .
police Gi@@ ves Tr@@ än@@ nar@@ as &amp; Rub@@ ber Com@@ rade against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
on Thursday , students gathered in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered to demonstrate against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police replaced tear gas and rubber proj@@ ec@@ tiles against the demonstr@@ ators .
the difficulties began when police officers tried to sc@@ rub the students , which led to the police of rubber floors and tear gas .
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
according to the Gover@@ nor of Sao Paulo Ger@@ al@@ do Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money .
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ iti spra@@ ying against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the latest protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been reli@@ eved from office by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and T@@ eher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the previous year .
since the international sanctions against Iran have been lifted , interest in Russian enterprises on businesses grew strongly in the country , the ambassador shared .
Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; &quot; &quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he noted that in the first five months of 2016 , the trading rate between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
in particular , Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million .
Russian imports from Iran rose 16 percent to $ 158 million .
the trade strike was achieved by supplies of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador .
this year , D@@ zh@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan returns from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
last year , the Russian Foreign Office gave approximately 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens .
in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries , as far as the number of tourists in Russia is concerned .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the same time , only a few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change .
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said .
sought @-@ after witnesses : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y fell on Thursday evening on the drink market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
under the restra@@ int of a gun , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ med their faces , demanded the release of cash from the staff of the drink market and then fled first on foot and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf .
how much money has been captured does not inform the police .
the perpet@@ rators were supposed to have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters large , so relatively small .
the beverage market is directly accessible and poor@@ ly visible from the market deck of the Re@@ we market .
after the raid , the perpet@@ rators must be stra@@ pped in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and the gravel parking with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) .
those who made observations at the time of the crime ( at 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , are urged to report urgently to the police .
Nag@@ old : fun and fun at summer@@ time
eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and youth of the socio @-@ pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection group Nag@@ old with their supervis@@ ors during their summer leisure in Nuss@@ dorf near Müh@@ lack@@ er .
in quietly situated leisure park Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ lt , the lively group was quartered during the first week of the school holidays .
several day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to B@@ saved with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo .
on the other hand to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world @-@ famous monastery .
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
on the hot days , the group lived at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and plan .
culinary delights of children and car@@ et@@ akers , such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese .
in workshops , be@@ ati@@ ked , beautiful jewels made of pearls and stones were created or made of wood a Roman mill game .
other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Color@@ ful evening . &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims to the Gate of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way for a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
together , four stages were dealt with .
in order to bridge the time to the next pilgrimage of all ministers in two years , the State Minister of the State of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage .
various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were examined and one finally decided for the Bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the open gate of mercy to the Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered .
16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the rooms of Heiligen@@ stadt , were on their way .
in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges and informed the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing .
von Hor@@ b was driven by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Mu@@ enster Un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s wife stands and so the pilgri@@ m &apos;s way from Münster was started .
each day and evening the individual tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts .
but also on the way , the Min@@ is made bells , chap@@ els and churches again and again in order to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m song .
the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were at their disposal for the nights .
Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller were on the stage for a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast .
on the second day we went on fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .

Scot@@ s@@ man Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite rings Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor role , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . the J@@ umping and made the legend proud when he stor@@ med home to get a victory from the favorites New Zealand .
England claimed a shock@@ ing victory four years ago , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als .
they repeated the trick after they took Ho@@ ys in March at the London Under@@ ground World Championships despite the resig@@ nation of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ der .
his retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that now un@@ folds .
Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won with Ho@@ y four years ago - and Sk@@ inner won the qualifying rounds in the qualifying rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round .
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
after his lap , Beh@@ ind was barely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
a change of strategy made a big part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ des drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep the pace .
Ho@@ y saw from his position as BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , when they climbed onto the podium .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Glas@@ gow Sk@@ inner said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I am only here to do my best and to make a name for myself .
in the final round we have set up an Olympic ch@@ ord and the World Champion defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
after the triumph in 2012 on the Kenn@@ ies and Ho@@ ys side , Hin@@ di said that after a weak start he fell on the track .
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al of England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
with such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said Hin@@ des : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it feels like London with all the UK flags . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics .
this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London .
if that is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle stream .
with the form of Kenn@@ y it is in the realm of possibility that he repe@@ ats the victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition .
this would be for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal .
this would be the same by Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int , starting today and going over three days .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hin@@ des said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England .
Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometre race .
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 .
the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 .
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
he had fought with representatives before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height .
in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and ended tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 .
the GB team relies on its strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of med@@ als .
after a truly extraordinary depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down .
Dra@@ mas with@@ drew in the background , such as the resig@@ nation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April , in the midst of the domin@@ ance and mo@@ bbing alleg@@ ations as well as the retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on .
but when one looks at the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom it looks like the legendary reputation of G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again .
future of melt production from Port@@ land due to the lifting of energy demand question@@ able
the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ places of workers - are at stake as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts as the delivering energy company announced .
this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant .
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years exp@@ ires in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake .
no fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk during a closure .
in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects as the enam@@ el consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria .
in 2014 Al@@ coa mel@@ ted the Point Henry Schmel@@ ing , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year .
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation regarding the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant .
AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting facility with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three more owners will announce their contracts .
the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ u@@ ben@@ i Cor@@ p hold smaller shares .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; AG@@ L still said that the tre@@ aties were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; security transactions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that should come into force in November 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the contracts have a period of 12 months , so they will end in 2017 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hence , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all potential effects on the revenue of AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong fut@@ ures markets for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L shared with the fact that the value of the contracts had already been written down in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ ility Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the enam@@ el &quot; is not impaired .
the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who would have entered into force from November this year , even if it is still a declaration of why it has resig@@ ned from the contract .
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
referring to the analysts &apos; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts per year and consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year .
should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; .
and that &apos;s not good for us as a generator , &quot; he said .
more than just a car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , Antonio is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue
Antonio Jen@@ ner , 20 , model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ the@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan Kr@@ is is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue .
Antonio , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and ran on Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ the@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , a common reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ th@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( except for the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the most popular show@@ bi@@ z @-@ on@@ els and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ re .
this represents the c@@ lich@@ é act of almost every birthday party of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ re brought the phrase , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a carto@@ on on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kr@@ is had to let her other girls participate in this publi@@ city somehow .
with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of car@@ ef@@ hi@@ ans started with certainty .
Kend@@ al &apos;s big sister Kim like her , as regards the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself .
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
with a circum@@ ference similar to an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the edition attracts a large number of adverti@@ sers ( Accor@@ ding to the 8@@ 32 pages of the Wäl@@ zers , 6@@ 15 pages of advertising ) .
the revelation of his cover star is expected to be so eag@@ erly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been filtered out before the official announcement .
women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s .
over the past few years there were clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties who like &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover .
Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jen@@ ni@@ fer La@@ wr@@ ence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor .
but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls under the previous category , she is in good company .
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even though everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade .
of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success to everyone .
with their reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Stephan@@ ie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Mist@@ resses of the Eye &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these feelings were high again when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but riding on the Mis@@ sm@@ ut seems to pass by the point .
San Antonio Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all of your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her free time she is seen in reality TV . presumably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
annual centres show 16@@ 0,000 people every year
more than 16@@ 0,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary services are dis@@ missed annually by the municipal authorities , while the industry has focused on the effects of further mid @-@ cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions .
in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and the like - are dis@@ missed upon request for free legal advice and legal assistance .
legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ ly utilized , are preparing for further cuts .
from June next year it is fores@@ een that these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of its federal funds .
the director of the community center of Que@@ bec James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey by the National Association of Community Cultural Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without repe@@ aling the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s municipal centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , meaning that thousands of people from important services you need , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and de@@ pressing debts , families who have been dis@@ missed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ just@@ ly dis@@ missed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need .
as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we call on the General Prosecutor and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately undo these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is now time to look at the needs of community centers and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign accused after employees allegedly pulled gun
new York : Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n was accused of alleged in@@ action after she was told that her campaign manager for North Carolina had directed a gun to a staff in February , while in February they were in a je@@ ep .
the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted to Vincent B@@ ord@@ i on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state .
&quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ ord@@ i admitted to have waited for months to regulate the matter internally before realis@@ ing that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pulled a gun , put his right foref@@ inger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ord@@ i in his indictment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after having compl@@ ained to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four other persons had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he admitted in the indictment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; weapons must not be fired to harm harm , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the indictment stated only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate had a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arm holders and weapon friends - should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in H@@ illary Clinton had to be elected and judge judge .
Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign made it clear that the media had torn his words out of the context and that he would not be able to appeal to violence .
B@@ ord@@ is &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of due di@@ ligence and Philip for bodily injury and suffering psychological damage .
Tr@@ um@@ ps spokes@@ woman in Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for an opinion .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) are notable for the SPD and the CD@@ U ruling party .
these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
while the red @-@ black government coalition could still further go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin .
in both federal states , however , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had a good chance of continuing the head of government .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern the SPD plum@@ met@@ ed from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent .
according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iled shortly before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent .
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag .
the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itated again in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 per cent each .
according to the vote in favour of the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , the SPD , according to the survey , was only 23 percent ( 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) .
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
it thus sm@@ iles behind the Gre@@ ens by 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left at 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
at 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope to return , the pir@@ ates would miss the entrance in contrast to 2011 .
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
today , the success@@ ors dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the tool weigh@@ ed almost half a kil@@ o and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand either .
on the contrary , it was quite pal@@ p@@ able .
the built @-@ in memory initially was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough today for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution .
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gigabyte .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; arrived exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for a few euros fans can buy the equipment still on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age .
20 years ago , however , communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as an office in western pocket format .
in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards at that time : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , also via fax the communic@@ ator was reached .
even access to web pages was possible by HTML browser , al@@ beit agon@@ izing slowly .
a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar .
there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop .
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
quite proud was the price : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euros .
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story though not Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled by Microsoft .
today , the market domin@@ ates vendors , all of which came much later than Nokia .
being online anytime and anywhere , this is today for a lot of people &apos;s everyday life .
in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple alone have 5@@ 55 million units .
worldwide sales with the equipment are around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running businesses of the countless app providers and the t@@ elec@@ oms companies .
a whole industry has now been developed around the smartphone .
the crucial breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the launch of the i@@ Ph@@ ones on Mac @-@ World .
he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator to easily operate everything via touch screen .
Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march began , today the iPhone is the most important product of the group .
Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had a look at .
they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight .
the sa@@ wing now has Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after its invention .
today every German looks at his mobile phone 88 times a day .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all need to learn to get the smart phone off , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for personnel in the Siemens executive board . &quot; &quot; &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must ste@@ er the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country .
for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London , when we ran a great effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions benefited from the games .
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for our local communities alone we will create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 4@@ 0,000 new jobs and prepare the youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of expansion He@@ ath@@ row is too great .
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ bling ourselves on the world stage .
the two fl@@ yers were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row too .
there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ ath@@ row answers every asked question .
like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
expansion is a way to create up to 18@@ 0,000 new jobs , £ 211 bn in a social growth and leave a legacy of skills and employment both at the airport and in the whole of the UK .
we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented walk@@ ways in the world .
now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment .
the 2012 London Games were a great success for UK and I am confident that He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row as well as secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in &quot; K@@ atz @-@ and mouse @-@ play &quot; regarding ad blocking
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to one of the software manufacturers , companies that make money with online advertising are trying to circum@@ vent ad blocking , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block display blocks on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus published a blog post in which it shared that users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network .
on Tuesday Facebook announced that its desktop side would change coding regarding its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect , which part of the advertisement is advertising .
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
in a blog post the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her @-@ struggle between the an@@ tim@@ ary open source community and the b@@ ypass have been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook comes soon with a new solution .
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the struggle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying sig@@ nage has become the industry .
according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ wers ; almost four times as much 2013 .
with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users who access Facebook through their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues .
apart from the fact that mobile ad blo@@ wers have no effect on Facebook mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , the company announced that it has no effect on mobile ad blo@@ cker on desktop PCs .
advertising on desktop PCs makes a sufficiently large share of revenues so that Facebook appears worth the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; &quot; &quot; on Tuesday Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ad co@@ fer@@ encing tool &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to give people more control over their advertising . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ blocks would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block contents on the page that are not advertising .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ad blo@@ wers are a bl@@ unt tool so we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .

the police call witnesses after a woman was passed on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday with a suspected suicide of several vehicles .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a woman lay down in the dark &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in an act of despair &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , said the police in Vau@@ d . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was over@@ powered by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself .
she died still on the spot .
several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , said the police , who call on these and every witness of the incident to report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; logical &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ etter shared the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed .
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is something that the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held accoun@@ table .
in each of the two cases - one person walking in the dark on the motorway - was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian walk@@ eth in the middle of the night on the highway as it was called in the newspaper .
last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the negli@@ gent killing after passing a man and killed one night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took judgment .
the Court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman -- who responded to an emergency call -- went in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; said the judge .
anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA Kli@@ m@@ amo@@ dell : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably hab@@ itable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies , NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate researchers .
the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere might have er@@ ron@@ eous conditions once created .
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and still slowly proce@@ eded .
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
the planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evap@@ oration .
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow rotation of the Venus expon@@ enti@@ ally increases her daily life of the sun for almost two months , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release .
this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat .
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees col@@ der than that of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus , similar to the evolution that was previously assumed by planet scientists .
although it was probably inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions of years .
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their steam was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
as their hydro@@ gen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus , which we know today .
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as trainer of the A@@ val@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co@@ determination in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process .
alternative President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; over the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the course of the summer , I have been thinking a lot about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , and to bring it to a higher level .
in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Hock@@ ey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization .
it must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Patrick informed me today about this decision , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
during his debut season Roy has won the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Award as the best coach of the league .
he took the club on 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last two years the late season .
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell back five points behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference .
as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal Canadi@@ en and A@@ val@@ an@@ che .
North America workers again take talks , put on strike
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; labour disputes concerning the remuneration for North Sea workers will be suspended while all the conflic@@ ting parties sit at the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot; &quot; &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were carried out spor@@ adi@@ cally on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT trade unions can confirm that we agreed to restart the resolution process of the present strike , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said in a joint statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we will hold some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent .
this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts will give the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
shell has released for thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group .
energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union .
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers leaders at the beginning of this week in order to discuss one of the largest work disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the North Sea and across the country we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion over the last five years .
Ke@@ pler measures the rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with Ke@@ pler spac@@ teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in the cluster of stars to different rates , and in what context are the rot@@ ational periods with planetary formation .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star enh@@ ancements , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release .
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
many stars in this cluster of stars that originated approximately 125 million years ago reach adul@@ thood .
they are now turning the fastest .
these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars cast large amounts of star@@ fish to peak @-@ rot@@ ational rates .
since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars .
when a star age , its rotation rate begins to slow down .
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recogni@@ zing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots --
the latest catalog of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars turn more slowly than a few massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es stars with dancers , with larger stars turn more slowly pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ballet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , while faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the star @-@ loops of the P@@ lei@@ ades are so close , it serves as an ideal Cos@@ mic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is much more to us about what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars slow down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot;
in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rot@@ ational rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal .
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the bas@@ eball @-@ star in the best days of Base zu Base .
after his emotional release , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old professional will wear the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay R@@ ays .
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game Parti@@ cip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) declared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has earned him 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as consultant and youth coach - with full salary .
as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid back for a long time .
with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hit and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some mil@@ estones .
with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players present similar values in the most important statistics .
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is likely not to be recorded in the Hall &apos;s Hall of Gl@@ ory Hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - was in the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; already in 2009 the super@@ star gave &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to have taken the banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in August 2013 , due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal , he was closed for 211 games by the end of 2014 .
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect to have received an anti @-@ aging hospital in South Florida for years .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 meetings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez at the time . &quot; &quot; &quot;
his farewell @-@ days did not run quietly .
while many bas@@ eball @-@ legends got the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez frequently had to sit on the bench .
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ardi .
after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relationship with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , received sympathy and sympathy from the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ riv@@ alen Boston red So@@ x .
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team .
Olympic 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland must not start in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ sh@@ ad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
before the seventh day of competition , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
Chinese flo@@ ats Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ Meter @-@ Obst@@ et@@ rac@@ tor Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the cri@@ tically eyed athle@@ tics competitions .
last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ oth@@ i@@ azi@@ de was detected in Ch@@ en , which is used as a m@@ asked medium for dop@@ ing substances .
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed its exp@@ ul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time .
on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old ranked 4th in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal .
on Friday , Ch@@ en would have participated in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ estyle .
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very serious and requires a full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the first time in history , the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the sanc@@ tion of athletes with positive cases .
also in the night of Rio the news broke over the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to the report , it is said to be the banned substance of the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent .
Dan@@ ek@@ ova has been suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ rehear@@ sal should have already been positive .
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly contacted the Ath@@ en@@ ians &apos; criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio .
on Friday the case of Adrian Ziel@@ inski , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg , was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ rol@@ on three days earlier .
both contest the intake , both of them must not start in the class up to 94 kg .
before starting the athletes , the case Dan@@ ek@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport .
the IA@@ AF world association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing , also the L@@ of@@ ern@@ ation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio .
in swimming , the previous contracts in China also ensured violent confron@@ tations among athletes .
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t picked up the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang hard .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over myself , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a debate with the Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
sun was positive in 2014 at the Chinese nation@@ als on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit down only for a three month lock .
data lau : as per@@ fi@@ de gro@@ uting h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mailing @-@ malware are currently target@@ ing companies - and are successful .
according to a recent survey conducted by the malware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes of 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surv@@ eyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partially multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software .
in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail .
40 percent of the victims will@@ ingly paid the ran@@ som sal@@ v@@ ings required by the perpet@@ rators in order to be able to re @-@ use the attacked systems and data .
the offen@@ ders speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observation of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes from attacks in company networks .
if they are successful there , the potentially causing ran@@ som is much higher than with private users .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malicious software , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Head Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; world . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in 2008 , most of the malware programmes were still designed to send advertising .
then the perpet@@ rators discovered black@@ mailing software for themselves .
only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred quickly in recent months .
Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word , Excel or database files , as well as archives of images and videos .
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
subsequently , the software presents the demands of black@@ mail .
to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of the Cryp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin .
however , where the personal photo database is at stake in private users , companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production .
accordingly , the damage drops when a ran@@ som@@ ware falls .
22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt operations , in case of a case , people were in danger of life .
in Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records .
&quot; we always say to the victims : do not pay , it only encourages the problem , &quot; explains Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski .
but 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data back .
for managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpet@@ rators in the face of stand@@ still in operation .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try to build up a good reputation .
in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpet@@ rators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money .
they explain their victims via chat , as they can pay via Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t sample files for free .
and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to return their data un@@ encrypted .
given the potentially high and relatively low @-@ risk earnings from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share the job , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons .
the program@@ mers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual black@@ mail .
the malware kits have been developed by buying malware , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars .
&quot; included in delivery is a fitting tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski .
the black@@ ers then look for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
so one logs in one of the forums on the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible .
payment is per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals then instruc@@ t Sp@@ ammer to spread , &quot; Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski explains .
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey trust that they can a@@ vert ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already pursuing new strategies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpet@@ rators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Head Mar@@ cin Kl@@ ec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this makes the damage potential much higher than before , depending on the type of data .
in the future , the perpet@@ rators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain .
on the Def@@ con h@@ acker conference , safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control .
in the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worthy of a ran@@ som .
if the cul@@ pr@@ its then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 .
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini van .
sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life .
although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear , it does not work closely at any point .
the materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant , only the cockpit upper side drops slightly .
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l with raised and 10@@ 26 l available in reverse back@@ rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin @-@ seats and thus offer storage space , which is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor to the ceiling .
the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008 .
the 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
he should do his job a little qui@@ eter though .
the daily consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort .
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the equipment in the top version &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( works up to Tempo 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane support assistant .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it evalu@@ ates many obstacles as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; approaching objects &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the remote light assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if necessary .
but full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more .
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are below the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine .
those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 200@@ 00 euros , diesel from 23@@ ,000 euros .
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car .
airline is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
a airline is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is conceivable only in the case of haz@@ ards that are typical of air traffic .
the plain@@ ti@@ ff had broken a knee with the fall .
the accident , however , could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court .
the airline did not have to pay any damages to the man .
case of illness : when paid by the organis@@ er
after their trip , ill holi@@ day@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel .
but this is only the case if more than 10 percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms .
in the case of the case , a family was ill with diarr@@ ho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ bell lau@@ b .
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their illness brought the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted the sea@@ water .
the family thought that the trip was so flaw@@ less - and compl@@ ained against the organis@@ er .
the plain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success in court .
indeed , the sewage treatment plant was indeed defective .
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the plain@@ ti@@ ff .
until then , he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
he did not viol@@ ate his duty of duty , so the judgment .
no im@@ pur@@ ities have been found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among themselves - belonged to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère said that after the violent acts committed by refugees in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks .
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terrorist threats .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpet@@ rators with hatred and division .
we will not allow this triumph to the terrorists .
if criminals have to leave the country faster , it will increase security and strengthen the consent of the people for the refugee policy .
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals for the 2017 parliamentary elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also announced another personnel reinforcement of the security forces , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four @-@ digit magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism must again be punished .
video surveillance is designed to am@@ eli@@ or@@ ate the right of arms in such a way that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is more difficult .
the recently discussed sec@@ rec@@ y obligation for doctors should be maintained according to de Ma@@ izi@@ ères &quot; words .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the medical profession , how the threat of citizens can be reduced , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said with regard to psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in order to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social care .
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in specific areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) de Ma@@ izi@@ ère plans to use cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; &quot; &quot; said SPD leader Gabriel : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against ac@@ tion@@ ism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
de Ma@@ izi@@ ère rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the aboli@@ tion of double citizenship before .
he considers a general ban on full @-@ wear to be constitu@@ tionally problematic .
you can &apos;t forbi@@ d everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka .
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses to court .
the Green Party leader Sim@@ one Peter accused the minister of simul@@ ating the action of action and action with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terror p@@ act .
&quot; &quot; &quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no more security in this country . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
but this is to change : the rule of law shall be extended .
this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the traffic jam , when they drive over the motorway for Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) .
the road construction continues on Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between Hammer Street and De@@ par@@ ture Wes@@ er Straße the legal bending track by 700 meters .
drivers can then come directly from the Hammer street to the right .
the major advantage : the traffic is getting early , making the entire process improved in the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 .
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of Mu@@ enster @-@ West .
the track nar@@ rowing on the feeder trains drivers above all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days , the way back to the bridge across the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes beyond .
the reason for this is the needle &apos;s eye on the B 51 shortly before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
from here , the traffic is only ste@@ ered via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be rebuilt three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load capacity to record heavy @-@ duty traffic in particular .
how long this bott@@ len@@ eck and the connected daily traffic will last , cannot be said by the competent regional company .
however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official remaining service life up to 20@@ 34 .
for the extension of the rule of law , the state enterprise deliberately chose the weaker time in the school holidays because disability is to be expected .
the traffic will be run along the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Tourism : cultural De@@ als for Schools
&quot; &quot; &quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; In@@ visible House . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theater are now planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with migration and refugee backgrounds to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Das invisible Haus &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; 19 students visited the Small House between eleven and 15 years of age . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee backgrounds , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project .
most of the young people in the class have come to Münster between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria , and speak little German .
thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action , such as the press release of the Young Theater Münster .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from Spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season within the framework of a musical theatre project .
from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background will be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music .
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theat@@ rical language mediation are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
in view of the increased numbers of refugees , the association expects many classes to participate .
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the shooting star Gu@@ ck@@ ern a line through the bill in the southwest of Germany in the night - but there is still hope .
the night was bad because of clouds and rain , watching the spectacle of heaven , the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , said on Friday morning .
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
the weather should be good , then we see many shooting stars in the sky .
the star scales are Per@@ sei@@ den , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars .
they have their name because they apparently come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east .
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
in the evening , one rolls around etern@@ ally ; at night , one is awake for hours , in the morning it is far from the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep .
this is anything but relaxing .
after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing .
what are sleeping problems or sleep disturbances ?
there are several forms of sleep disorders , and they can be under@@ pinn@@ ed by diverse causes , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ del , member of the board of the German Society of Sle@@ eves and Sle@@ ep Medicine .
what you can see below , is the in@@ som@@ nia , i.e. an entry and sleep disorder .
just through sleep many people find themselves as un@@ satisfactory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Var@@ el .
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
behind this can be organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication .
in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very early wake @-@ up is common with a depression , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says We@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it can be that different factors thank each other .
who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts to sal@@ ute about everyday problems and worries , there is an example .
this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible .
when should I go to a doctor with sleeping disorders ?
those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor , advises we@@ aving .
the impair@@ ment may look quite different : one is beaten , tired , und@@ ressed , has difficulty with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache .
in order to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes .
as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - in@@ quired .
there is hardly any rec@@ essed sleep medi@@ ator in Germany , empha@@ sizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the inter @-@ disciplinary centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin .
therefore , in case of sleeping problems one should contact the general practitioner first , advises we@@ aving .
it can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep lab , and what happens there ?
for example , in the sleep lab , doctors advise doctors in snor@@ ing with respiratory infections , in case of disease ti@@ redness , sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorders , explains Fi@@ etze .
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; please do not take a nap , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after glu@@ ing , one goes to bed at its normal time .
besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ ggles , a chest strap and a sensor at the finger .
in addition , a camera on the ceiling draws up the bedroom .
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sleep for a better sleep .
it counts : regular sleep and up@@ time , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcohol and do not look at night at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ duci@@ ve .
what the jungle camp has to have with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting off the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 , he brought gold for the first time at the world championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has protected himself against his ex @-@ team @-@ mates in the criticism of his criticism .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets 20,000 € bonus and a € 15@@ 0,000 jungle person should not be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the transport system in swimming is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good .
this means that we can &apos;t compete with countries that promote a lot and do not even look at the dop@@ ing issue or even operate it .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if he wanted to start a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler had to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ Dop@@ ing Agency ( NA@@ DA ) .
this is exactly how to keep it with countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you cannot control a certain amount of time before WM / OS from independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you can &apos;t take part , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the election ham@@ burger who meanwhile runs an ice cream shop . &quot; &quot; &quot;
airport : gang of luggage racks arrested
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf Airport
the Düsseldorf police officers were arrested on Thursday by two women and two men aged 50 to 61 .
the suspect had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage ste@@ els as gangs .
at 21.@@ 30 , civil servants at the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen from past theft charges .
since the middle of July this year , the two women and two men had committed several crimes and , in doing so , had proce@@ eded professionally and professionally .
the Speci@@ alists of the Crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can prove four deeds to the thi@@ eves submitted to Germany specifically for the provision of criminal off@@ ences .
they had captured a total of over 15,000 Euro .
the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain does not seem the same at first sight , but the police is one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city .
when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes through play@@ grounds , a fres@@ co@@ ed kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; someone has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on the façade of a grey house . &quot; &quot; &quot;
compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demoli@@ shed soon , it is already being built : until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; article about this &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trendy neighborhood &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain calls , is , however , preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have lease agreements , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events .
since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin inner sen@@ ator handle had spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area designated as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence .
after evacu@@ ating the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ sch@@ mie@@ de , with 300 police officers on June 22nd , the police pat@@ rolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on @-@ site , locked parts of the road and refra@@ ined from entering the house with the number 94 .
meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the building workers commissioned the rooms .
on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal , and one day later , police and construction workers followed the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ is@@ ers and residents .
on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are chat@@ ting vor@@ m late .
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
left violence is not the main concern of many people : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in the Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who has grown here three children , are mainly anno@@ yed by the police presence .
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share concern with increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication .
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z , who mostly wanted police protection against v@@ and@@ alism .
the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin sen@@ ator and the police put up between house occup@@ ants and their neighbours , obviously does not exist .
Friedrich@@ sh@@ ain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker &apos;s quarter , which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk .
house occup@@ ations and the native housing projects have long been part of the Kie@@ z neighborhood : in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga .
while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police regulations in a regular street battle , many of the projects in Riga were leg@@ alized and partly still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago .
at the same time , in recent years , the city district has become a magnet for tourists and bal@@ ers from all over the world . residents of GDR times and former home @-@ occup@@ iers now share their neighbourhood with them .
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development : one recognizes them at thrown slices or freshly painted facades , which were thrown with color @-@ bags .
&quot; &quot; &quot; no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; left autonomous violence &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
one reason that not all neighbours look at it as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body injury tend to be almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen .
most of the off@@ enses make damage that tends to make new buildings and newly renovated houses .
for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ant next to the disputed 94 years ago , there can be no talk of uncertainty .
as for violence , it is weigh@@ ty : the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be .
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga anymore .
for the studied architecture her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has deliberately moved into the Riga @-@ Straße - and remained .
that is why it was also so important that the residents get back their streets : from the police , politics and media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the bor@@ ough .
but in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings that disp@@ lace the old inhabitants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these are ultimately property @-@ apartments which are not interesting for many here - people prefer people who are not so well contaminated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I cannot appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should we do if someone never stops ?
there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the residents .
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for people who are fond of color bombs : the skin projects and the left scene were part of the Kie@@ z neighborhood .
who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub district , can complain about noise there .
all persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee commission@@ er
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee commission@@ er for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
it sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group , refugee aid , administration , authorities and who else is involved .
Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is here , the ei@@ ving wo@@ ollen @-@ sow , which is above all a problem .
thus some - less mo@@ cking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write down the place .
we were looking for a management team with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an ei@@ ving lust for wool .
but administrative work is not their central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
above all , it is about organization , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity .
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position limited to three years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine client that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there are big and small problems , organizational , human and understanding problems .
soon there are new containers in the Was@@ en@@ straße
a serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection .
they must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves .
responsibility changes from the coun@@ cils of coun@@ cils to the Commune and Job@@ center .
problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search for some time has been very difficult .
de facto , the administration does not find private apartments .
it didn &apos;t work until now , so it is necessary to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le .
therefore , community apartments must be considered as it is so beautiful .
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine client and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree .
in addition to a fixed stay there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school sites , single @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be und@@ one or set up .
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine client .
many work in the building yard or help house masters , do char@@ itable work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports .
she hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and client .
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses .
professional courses are rare .
so administration and volunteers also jump here .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
they have to explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can make sense for the time , for example with language courses .
who at some point develop the feeling that he cannot help nobody in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be integrated .
the clear majority is motivated .
but there is also problem cases , says customer hon@@ estly , &quot; people who do nothing at all . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motiv@@ ate others .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
a difficult question : do the two after the recent incidents fear radic@@ alisation , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what some may call na@@ ï@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they were afraid that the assass@@ ins would bring them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client .
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and hon@@ our@@ able volunteers must look out for activities in the region and in the region .
they have always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need an upper limit ?
to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid .
actually it is unfair to put them on site .
&quot; we have not yet arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le .
no new refugees , that would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ g@@ bacher is already busy to integrate the present people wis@@ ely .
these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men .
but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree .
the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers .

Thurin@@ gia : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec came closer to sales billion
a high demand for medical technology in Asia stimulated the sales of Carl Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec .
in the first nine months of the financial year , consolidated sales rose by 6.@@ 7 percent to EUR 79@@ 8.@@ 6 million , as the listed company announced on Friday in Jena .
