<seg id="1">Golfer Langer gets the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer and some colleagues were looking for a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old, it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden Sports Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">After a few minutes the horses remembered their holidays, they drove home to the forage troughs in the fast gallop.</seg>

<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says.</seg>
<seg id="9">And thus the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">He let himself be led with his family about the system of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swear for photo-purposes.</seg>
<seg id="12">Long was the first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sport aid handed the man from Anhausen to the Golden Sports Pyramid as part of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards to the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes Lorlaurel, Champions-Tour-Player of the year...</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>

<seg id="25">Many of these sports legend had come to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumps Economic Policy Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreements TTP - both are Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">However, the two US presidential competitors are at the helm of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question.</seg>
<seg id="4">The difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, more philosophical distinction.</seg>
<seg id="5">Der, about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small and warns against how the state of economy can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and to regulate it, he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">He himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, asserts Trump.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "he will massively withdraw regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private persons and for companies." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "Clinton, on the other hand, says:" "" "the state has to fulfil certain tasks, it has disadvantaged chances and needs money." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Therefore taxes for the rich would be increased, they say.</seg>
<seg id="12">Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="13">In the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost all the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate has not announced the greatest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be partial discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and retract coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Parisian climate protection agreement wants to terminate.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "Clinton, on the other hand, intends to extend and demand renewable energies with its investment program:" "" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even in the case of international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">TPP, the transitory trade agreement, do not want to sign both.</seg>
<seg id="24">At the same time, however, both of them do not want to isolate the US from international trade, but simply want to protect American jobs better.</seg>
<seg id="25">They should be paid better then, for example Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">What Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to get up, then he says he must not be changed.</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">On the one hand, Trump is standing, who wants to relieve the economy and its citizens in order to boost growth.</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics believe that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">On the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least one of the rich wants them to pay more taxes, and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the Registrainarians have called upon their union to approve new employment policies in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an alliance of outsiders?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give their hands and proclaim an official end to the eight-month long-lasting war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">But when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace in reception, I cannot deny the impression that Ankara is most willing to reconcile this reconciliation.</seg>
<seg id="5">There was the handshake, yes.</seg>
<seg id="6">But Putin's smile seemed to smallish and he hardly radiated warmth, even for his restrained relations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" "" "dear friend" "" "Putin - according to a report a whole five times." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">He also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but would even improve.</seg>
<seg id="10">The next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved as if something bad had never happened.</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm was rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">But one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to mention in its introductory words: the firing of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border through Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at that time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin announced and accused Ankara of having fallen in the back of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offense was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">To rebuild the veto is difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">For months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara.</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">Most serious were the allegations of senior officials that Erdogan had profited from illegal oil trading in Syria's regions, controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">Finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the excuse from President Erdogan to hear him.</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are clear.</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan, primarily, needs all the friends he can get after he became extinct in the last month with a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">In Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed.</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a later seasonal attack on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">This week, the State TV predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as Turkish agrarian imports are allowed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"" "a report in Vedemsti put it as follows:" "" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West as it considers its reaction to the attempt to seize power as a weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">To this end, the ongoing resentment over the snail of EU accession negotiations and Putin - which is keen to benefit from the cool sentiment and reduce Turkey's relationship to the West.</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state in Ankara won a bonus that he demanded support for the elected State organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is a matter of course for Moscow, which itself has a deep fear of regime change.</seg>
<seg id="41">The summit in this glittering palace by the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to portray an "alliance of outsiders" as an analyst once described me: two countries that are driven by the West and feel bad treated and now unite.</seg>
<seg id="42">Nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two.</seg>
<seg id="43">The biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides.</seg>
<seg id="44">It might be significant that after almost three hours of preliminary talks, both presidents were at the press conference stating that they did not even strike the subject.</seg>
<seg id="45">The President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this.</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster when NATO member Turkey shook the Russian struggle - it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once more.</seg>

<seg id="1">Russian Putin fires Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov</seg>
<seg id="2">Russian President Vladimir Putin recently fired his Chief of Staff Sergei Ivanov.</seg>
<seg id="3">IVANOV was part of Putin's closest family of trust for many years.</seg>
<seg id="4">The 63-year-old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport matters.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "in an opinion of the Kremlin, it is said that without stating reasons, Putin has ordered the release of Ivanovs from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="6">Anton Vaino, who has been a substitute for Ivanovs since 2012, has been appointed to his successor.</seg>
<seg id="7">Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat.</seg>
<seg id="8">Born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the renowned State Moscow Institute of International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy.</seg>
<seg id="9">On the website of the Kremlin it is called (in Russian) that he later was the head of the head of the head of the government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "he said about his appointment to Putin:" "" "thank you for your confidence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "I think it is the government's most important task to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of law and controls to implement your instructions." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin informed the Russian TV broadcaster on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest confideners for a long time and works like him for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">As Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>
<seg id="17">At a meeting with President Putin, broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigns at his own request.</seg>
<seg id="18">But despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections.</seg>
<seg id="19">So what is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this right now.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the official assertion - that a man who once was promoted as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy at once - met with great scepticism.</seg>
<seg id="22">In his remarks to Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said, "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to give me this very complicated position - you could almost say - to confide up for four years.</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV received the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and, as Putin, a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">In the late 1990s, when Putin was Chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy.</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin arrived in power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusts most.</seg>
<seg id="29">It was once believed that after Putin's second term Ivanov could become President of Russia, since a third term of office would have violated Putin's constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">But this post was taken by another conserving ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev.</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became Prime Minister before he became president for three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the north deck of the Queenser crossings to the Viaduct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "it is the first of four closing of the" "" "deck-blowers" "", "which are approaching the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">It has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 helical ropes.</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown made a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go to the bridge from the country.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "he said," "" "This is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queenser crossings." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">We are all witnesses of an engineering art from a truly epic scale in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="11">Despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the closure between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit.</seg>
<seg id="12">In total, almost 79% of the total decks are in their place and the last section of the deck today gets a drone for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "Michael Martin, project manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "" "the first shutter represents a significant milestone for each bridge project." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">This fantastic project represents the closure of future-oriented high and civil engineering.</seg>
<seg id="15">After the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the expansion of the north tower, we had to close the still existing gap on the north or the country side.</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters to the south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">Massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%.</seg>
<seg id="19">Delicate because the tolerances on which the team were working were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimetres.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "the SPD proposes a" "" "housing concept living" "" "for the next council meeting." ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But quarrel is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost, it's about the question: who should actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann says:" "" "we are united with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must in future reject 20 percent of all apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">However, the cheap apartments can also be built on stock.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "however, the big issue in the town hall is," "" "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private surfaces?" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "we want investors to build at least 10 per cent on such surfaces, but as far as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="13">"" "the problem, as Bratmann says:" "" "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even harder jobs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">Notwithstanding that, as Bratstmann, there is a tightening of the situation on the housing market.</seg>
<seg id="17">If the action plan is implemented, this will take care of additional tasks in the building management.</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how does one compensate the loss of further 1,300 favorable apartments whose support will take place over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">By 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">In order to prevent this, so the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole Palm, should now be bought out bonds from the city.</seg>
<seg id="24">In addition, it would have to be thought to bring apartments back into the price fastener.</seg>

<seg id="26">At one stroke the problem could be solved.</seg>
<seg id="27">For in the west-city, deadlines run out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the price fastener for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: this does not want the owners, the flat building companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">Because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dramatically again, it is removed from the goal of the so-called thoroughfare.</seg>
<seg id="31">There will be no more concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few city districts.</seg>

<seg id="1">Pokémon Go, a hunt for health and happiness that pays off</seg>
<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">That teenagers and children do not go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been complained by many in the last decade.</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">The time on the screen was initially on TV, then video games and most recently on smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">Of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on characters that were initially created for video games in the 1990s (later they created a cartoon, playing cards and other spin-offs).</seg>
<seg id="8">Like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand started in early July.</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries was postponed by the massive demand that the servers overloaded.</seg>
<seg id="10">Within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">In short, players go outside with their smartphones and look for Pokémons tracking with a GPS and once they have been found, "photographed" (via a screenshot on the mobile phone) or "captured."</seg>
<seg id="13">A generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the turkey and jumped for the search of the sofa.</seg>
<seg id="14">In the USA, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the "average" person withdraws every day.</seg>
<seg id="15">Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which followed 35.000 users, recently announced that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of persecuted people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent.</seg>
<seg id="16">The company doesn't know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "many public awareness campaigns on health that people want to" "" "take 30 minutes of time" "" "from the sofa" "" "and" "" "to be active every day" "", "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people looking eleventh." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">Nevertheless, the importance of sports cannot be overrated.</seg>
<seg id="19">Those who regularly drive sports reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression.</seg>
<seg id="20">Physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here.</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoor that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">Thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun.</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always, there are also murky game spoils that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">And yes, someone could walk against a door.</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it about?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even though smart phone apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they have no reason to do sport as it does this game.</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">Due to Pokemon's success, however, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the activator in the real world and will help many people in the hunt to be more active, more fitter and healthier.</seg>

<seg id="8">Brilliant on whole line brilliant.</seg>
<seg id="9">And now finally the Olympic champion.</seg>
<seg id="10">The 19-year-old American gymnast erklomm thursday to the multi-campaign title and magnified the gap between himself and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">Her overall score of 62,198 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">The female Simone Biles turnt on the balance beam during the solo multi-campaign of women in gymnastics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="13">Biles is the fourth heterosexual American woman who wins a multi-fight title and in total the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all.</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">Biles has dominated the sport for the last three years, 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is "the best gymnast I've ever seen."</seg>
<seg id="17">It awaited her last examination in Brazil, a competition that did not go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a burden of oversized expectations.</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring, Texas would be seen as a disappointment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The American women Simone Biles, left, and Aly Raisman embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the single multi-campal of women in gymnastics at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Thursday</seg>
<seg id="20">Billy took the first medal on Tuesday, while at the farewell celebration of the retiring team ordinator Martha Karolyi served as exclamation mark.</seg>
<seg id="21">Although Billy insisted that during their long way to the top, never planned the future, this is not really true.</seg>
<seg id="22">Part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is matched to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympiaarena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="24">This girl adopted by her grandparents as a little child and was discovered by trainer Aimee Boormans during a school excursion into the gymnasium, trained in the Boorman, became a force.</seg>
<seg id="25">Since the summer of 2013, it has not lost any competition competition, a winning streak that will last as long as it wishes.</seg>
<seg id="26">Even though Mustafa was slightly led by two turns, the picture was deceptive.</seg>
<seg id="27">Brigade bars and bottoms - in which Bile holds the world title - lurking.</seg>
<seg id="28">She got back with 15,433 on the beam back - and sat on top of it with a 15,933 on the floor.</seg>
<seg id="29">Raisman embraced her gently when she expected her Endergbnis - a pure formality - and tears streamed on Biles glossy red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality.</seg>
<seg id="30">The performance Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal went to Mustafina in a Tiebrake.</seg>
<seg id="31">This time, the 22-year-old team of men, called "Oma" by the Americans, had a lead.</seg>
<seg id="32">After her cultivation practice she threw out kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes appeared doubtful.</seg>
<seg id="33">As for Biles, the rapidly expanding Tweet of the 19-year-olds has a whole new meaning at the beginning of this week:</seg>

<seg id="2">According to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot dead in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade ago in Phoenix, while listening to the car and listening to music.</seg>
<seg id="3">Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis's daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said.</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a firearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">The police announced that the threefold murder does not seem to have been the result of a robbery, as the attacker did not take the handbags or the $2,900, owned by one of the adult victims.</seg>
<seg id="6">Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting had led the investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks.</seg>
<seg id="7">In total, seven people were killed in nine out of a period of four months and two were injured in nine attacks.</seg>
<seg id="8">"it happens in a residential area in front of a house," announced Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month.</seg>
<seg id="9">It is believed that the suspect has used several vehicles, including a brown car from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln.</seg>
<seg id="10">The investigators refused to expose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same assassin.</seg>
<seg id="11">Ellis, 33, was hospitalized because of her injuries and died later.</seg>
<seg id="12">Liner, 31, and Ellis's daughter Maleah died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="13">A witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music.</seg>
<seg id="14">The authorities also published a police report about the shooting, which cleared an empty pickup truck half an hour before the three-fold murder and assumed that it was the factory of serial killer.</seg>
<seg id="15">Investigators found cartridge sleeves and secured a sphere from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment.</seg>

<seg id="1">Why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the gymnast and that out of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">Firstly, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA has never been so dominant.</seg>
<seg id="4">And second, this team has three turners, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren "Laurie" Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin tone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, makes everyone proud.</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic-feminine presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">In the last four years, the number one among female turners was an African-American.</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2 were.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">During the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was cheered by a surprising Olympic winner and America.</seg>
<seg id="12">Now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the three-time world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms routines.</seg>
<seg id="13">On Thursday, Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition for women.</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">We experience the top of this sport, but do not look like gymnastic classes throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone, Gabby and Laurie hit all the same way as Aly and Madison in order to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "they are the" "" "Last Five" "", "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as trainer." ""</seg>
<seg id="18">But the reality is that Turnen is an expensive sport and gymnasts primarily in private sports clubs, which are maintained by parents, who pay for training, training, travel clothing, competition and hotel costs (for the trainers and their gymnasts and families).</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these gymnasiums lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">In these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families.</seg>
<seg id="21">Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have trained both her athletes since they started gymnastics.</seg>
<seg id="22">We have to give the churches aun innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-reach gymnastics training.</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">At my events we have offered free and affordable Turnen in Harlem for over 15,000 urban juveniles (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners.</seg>
<seg id="25">In September, we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer the youth a high-quality gymnast, earning the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="26">Turnen develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind.</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers lifelong benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team who bring thousands of young girls to be interested in gymnastics and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">It is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls.</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Thank you Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this real presentation of "Girl Power" by holding the Olympic team golds and thanks, you are motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to get their way to becoming healthy, strong and successful young women.</seg>

<seg id="1">Assistance doctors would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jeremy Hunts's proposal</seg>
<seg id="2">The ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 assistants voted for a vote rejected him.</seg>
<seg id="3">In July Hunt had revealed plans to introduce the contract and said that the NHS would be in a "Niemandsland" and any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients.</seg>
<seg id="4">The first assistants are supposed to receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend fees, in order to improve the maintenance.</seg>
<seg id="5">Dr Ellen McCourt, chairman of the BMA committee for assistants shared last night in a message: "assistants have felt serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current staff crisis and have agreed to treat all physicians."</seg>
<seg id="6">With only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress must be made and time runs out.</seg>
<seg id="7">Efforts on the part of the BMA to resolve disputes by talks have met with the government for reluctance to participate and sometimes on deafening silence.</seg>
<seg id="8">That was the case of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made last month that his door would always be open.</seg>
<seg id="9">"" "" "" "Jeremy Hunt must act now, raise awareness and address the concerns of the assistants." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="10">If he does not do so, the assistants have made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures.</seg>
<seg id="11">The last strike at the end of April saw a postponement of nearly 13,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments, as nurses and specialists were included in order to allow doctors to cover the strike post chain.</seg>
<seg id="12">The ministers hoped to be able to end the dispute over the changes by adopting the reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association.</seg>
<seg id="13">The BMA would like to pay a better week pay for the 54,000 assistants who are subject to the contract.</seg>
<seg id="14">Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS Staff, called on the assistants to stop the strike.</seg>

<seg id="17">Employers hoped that continued positive commitment to other important issues - such as sending, flexibility in training sessions, training courses, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the BMA agreements in November, February and May.</seg>

<seg id="3">The anticoagulant drug Ticagrelor reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease.</seg>

<seg id="6">The regulatory authority NICE of the NHS has recommended a four-year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems.</seg>
<seg id="7">Around 140,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke.</seg>
<seg id="8">Heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty tissue in the artery walls that form plaque.</seg>
<seg id="9">When the layer breaks apart, it can cause a blood clots causing blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="10">When the blood clots dissolves, it can flow through the blood stream and clog the blood flow to the brain, causing a stroke.</seg>
<seg id="11">Persons who had already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ticagrelor, manufactured by the British company AstraZeneca and marketed under the trade name Brilique, reduces this risk by making the formation of blood clots more unlikely.</seg>
<seg id="13">The draft of NICE, published today, recommends a 12-month intake of 90mg Ticagrelor, followed by 60mg with a twice daily intake of aspirin for the next three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">Professor Carole Longson, Director of the NICE Health Technology Assessment Center, said: "despite the availability of secondary prevention, a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences."</seg>
<seg id="15">Fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person.</seg>
<seg id="16">Experience shows that Ticagrelor is effective in combination with aspirin to reduce further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="17">With a preliminary recommendation from Ticagrelor, we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it.</seg>
<seg id="18">The information on the efficacy and safety of Ticagrelor - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years.</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness's culture flourishes in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year for dismissal of a government report on corruption from the office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">The former cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles verbally accesses the police, election observers and town halls to ignore evidences of electoral abuse due to "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion."</seg>
<seg id="5">The former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, which is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set up shutters outside of elective cabins to protect impaired voters.</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should have an identification with him in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">At present, a voter just needs to call his name and address.</seg>
<seg id="8">The report suggests not removing removable ink on a person's finger if they release their vote in order to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection, says Sir Eric.</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "" "" "this is not only for election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial fraud culture associated with it," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election skandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">Last year, a special electoral court decided that the incumbent mayor Lutsk Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office.</seg>
<seg id="14">The Court found that Rahman would have perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in a cynical way," and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobic crimes.</seg>

<seg id="19">"" "" "" "Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including conducting expressions to prove the identity." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">In his report, it is said: "as evidence, pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people, in order to vote according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Bangladeshi background.</seg>

<seg id="33">Intensifying the training to ensure that employees are generally able to assert that voters go alone into the election cabin.</seg>

<seg id="2">The world outside is a dangerous place, but this video of Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you.</seg>
<seg id="3">We spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Regardless of whether you are approaching from front or back, this video will show you how to turn it around for your robber.</seg>
<seg id="5">When you get closer to you, then you should turn around as first so that you can see your attacker and go out of the shot line, "says Mizrachi.</seg>
<seg id="6">Then grab the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before you face it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Then strike it with your knee in the bar and twist while the attacker interferes with pain, the weapon out of his hands. beat him with the run into the face and move backwards as they judge the weapon on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">In case of seizure approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot.</seg>
<seg id="9">Shift the weight to the weapon at the same time and strike the attacker on the chest, then twist the gun from its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it.</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="2">"" "" "" "a British traveller undertook his immune system and the reflex of a serious test - by licking down some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe." ""</seg>
<seg id="3">The moderator and author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk wasted his course on a euro note, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinse button of a draw toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system.</seg>
<seg id="4">Before the lick of each object he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to do.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "but the experiment that was filmed under the title" "" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" "" "brought some surprising results to daylight." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The idea to check the flushing button of a draw toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink.</seg>
<seg id="7">On his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria as well as about his own health.</seg>
<seg id="8">Fortunately nothing left what he defiled, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth.</seg>
<seg id="9">Mr. Wright was known to test the resilience of his intestines by traveling through the world and ate strange and wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">From public funds to stations up to sinks of toilets, the task definitely presented his immune system under a test</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "in the film he said," "" "As a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was justified in any case.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His proofs showed a luminometric speed of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">In comparison, the luminometric speed of freshly washed hands is less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet which he refused to check after their luminometric speed was over 4000 units while freshly washed hands have one of less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," who shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "in the film he says:" "" "this comes close to the worst thing I've been talking about in a toilet." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more dirty than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not leak here because it is disgusting inside.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">The company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support intestinal bacteria and immune system.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "Mr. Valios Senior Venice president for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" "" "we really wanted to offer consumers something new." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried crazy brainstormings that ended with saying "Let's call Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in gut health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">Instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system.</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added: "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to check them out and others in which this was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "I am glad we recorded some of these filthy treats on film." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">In a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria, in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said that they use at least occasionally products containing lactic acid bacteria.</seg>

<seg id="2">A social family left her social housing after a delogation with a loss of £50,000, because she had terrorized her neighbors.</seg>
<seg id="3">Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="4">After they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative had the property in an irreparable state.</seg>
<seg id="5">The walls had holes, wood panels were piled up, rubbish was spread on the floor and graffiti was lubricated on the walls.</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management of Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "she said," "" "It was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live this way." ""</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also.</seg>
<seg id="11">The couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror which the family had inflicted was street fights with baseballs, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, strikers and curses.</seg>
<seg id="12">Skelon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, had an arrangement for anti-social behavior in June.</seg>
<seg id="13">In some rooms of the house that will be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found</seg>
<seg id="14">In the estate where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were piled up</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and had to call the police regularly.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing delounded her and her partner this week by force from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to voluntarily train.</seg>

<seg id="24">Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, said that it would have contracted the family to cooperate with local authorities.</seg>
<seg id="25">The family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house garbage and old toys were thrown down</seg>

<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have provided us with the information.</seg>
<seg id="30">"" "" "" "I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveys that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times, but that they were all over 20.</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogation on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers in house management will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">In 2014, the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as garages, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700.</seg>
<seg id="35">Skelon received a fine, after owning itself to the property of a drug of class B in commercial intent.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">After they were without shelter, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in private accommodation in Plymouth.</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say they are deloding tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow from the Devon and Cornwall police announced that the delocation was a clear warning to the other tenants who did not stick to the house rules.</seg>

<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leader of Kenya by doping controllers.</seg>

<seg id="6">The locals, who are to be convinced by the election champions, are on vacation.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most vacationers on the island, on the island of Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not local people, so they are not allowed to choose the day of the country.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are practical problems: during the holidays helpers who hang posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and end voices, only laboriously apply.</seg>
<seg id="9">Until 4 September 2016, the election day and the last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass the election campaign to the people.</seg>
<seg id="10">The hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun.</seg>
<seg id="11">And it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a coalition of SPD / CDU, must be afraid of his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="12">The SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in polls clearly behind the CDU.</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of coalition dusting.</seg>
<seg id="14">Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost unobtrusive election campaign, one sees from his big posters.</seg>
<seg id="15">He travels across the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as his legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff also did.</seg>

<seg id="18">The CDU, with its leading candidate, the Minister of Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the right place at the wrong time.</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale demonstrations; Merkel's parliamentary group is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the target group did not agree that there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern.</seg>

<seg id="22">But it's a shame not to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">Apart from that, the Northeast-CDU refrains from the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons.</seg>
<seg id="24">"" "this, so Kokert thinks, plays a" "" "subordinate role" "". "" ""</seg>

<seg id="27">The Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert to his comrades is also self-exposing: "they must go where they are, where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">Because much is on the game, Sellering has now called on his SPD to become a particularly committed campaign.</seg>
<seg id="29">In polls, the Socialists and Democrats were at least 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19).</seg>
<seg id="30">In 2011, the SPD had won a clear 35.6 percent share in front of the CDU (22).</seg>
<seg id="31">The Greens, small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag.</seg>

<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about at the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>

<seg id="8">The reciprocity of those responsible for the construction works is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of accommodation facilities.</seg>
<seg id="9">Since the construction site moved to the south on Monday and also the block of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus also the connection to Rottenburg has been restored, the traffic situation within the location relaxes.</seg>

<seg id="13">The residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many creeping roads were looking for and more familiar with their Navi than the signs.</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were frayed in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">Since the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increasingly called for the trade fair vehicle from Mössingen.</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable exaggerations," says King, who made himself knowledgeable about the situation.</seg>

<seg id="19">Since the construction site has been moved on, it has become quieter.</seg>
<seg id="20">For business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg now the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">But that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales revenue for them lets anyone looking through.</seg>
<seg id="23">However, some are more and some less affected.</seg>

<seg id="29">Not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it "hard."</seg>

<seg id="35">If I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently.</seg>
<seg id="36">Instead, government president Jörg Schmidt on a request from Göhner, if there could be a financial compensation, answered with the hint that the restaurant would otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now they must also bear the disadvantages that result in the refurbishment.</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows about other districts where something has been handled more generous.</seg>
<seg id="38">For all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue.</seg>
<seg id="39">After all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, and refers to the long history.</seg>
<seg id="40">That other regular guests are now less frequently looking past due to the complicated traffic management, he can understand.</seg>
<seg id="41">If you can't drive, it's also somewhere else beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="42">Göhner has no doubts about the fact that his stem-clientele comes back at the end of the restoration work.</seg>
<seg id="43">Despite the crises with BSE and avian influenza, Göhner is holding the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long-standing history.</seg>

<seg id="6">Despite the diesel affaires, Europe's largest automaker can further advance a plus in spite of its many brands and some well-running markets.</seg>

<seg id="9">In Western Europe alone, after China the second most important market, sales were 14 percent below the previous year's month.</seg>

<seg id="15">Large support for VW is the Chinese market.</seg>
<seg id="16">Overall, the principally affected local brand of Lower Saxony is further glimming through the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a drop-out minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is available.</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler continued to present a sales platform from January to July.</seg>
<seg id="18">Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5,904 million worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated with a software exhaust system.</seg>
<seg id="20">In Germany alone, VW is calling around 2.5 million wagons for conversion into the workshops.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the course of retrofitting VW, VW confirmed that the conversion of cars has no negative effects.</seg>

<seg id="32">With the long term "guarantee" Volkswagen is able to see that for example half a year after the conversion, customers will have to go into a workshop for half a year after the conversion - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it.</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">Before moving to the comment section to reconsider it under the pseudonym of non-Alleename Men of Middle Ages with harsh insults, this statement is derived from current data.</seg>
<seg id="4">According to YouGov, the multiplication of sound plates discussed is not based on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to lead back to Midlife nostalgia.</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">In fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers.</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hormone from hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers rather retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">If this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest gray suit and stumble wildly before I stand, hold my hands and talk a bit more intimate like: "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So, let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">Even though the heart of Sohos is slowly losing its charm - Hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling up the buildings in which once independent vendors have been resident - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores.</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such stores and try to assess their age and mind by observing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I'm from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle aged men) into Reckless Records (number of data: eight men middle-aged, a woman, presumably around the 20), is a day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours.</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector, I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess already," he says.</seg>
<seg id="16">I have about 3.000 or 4.000 plates.</seg>
<seg id="17">These records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress up the walls of his living room.</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford to buy and buy items he sold when he was young and broke.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was too young to buy them," "" "he says." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">He agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and would like to spend time alone, and adds: "I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers whom he meets will apply to the YouGov profile.</seg>
<seg id="23">He also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media pump, people who have heard about the comeback and get to buy back their old records.</seg>
<seg id="24">From the conversations that I have led, people have generally been deprived of their collection in 1998 or 1999.</seg>
<seg id="25">Customers who once sold their records to buy CDs sell their CDs now to buy their records again, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of fans of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">According to WEZ, some of the older customers received an impetus to the contactless payment system.</seg>
<seg id="30">Some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to get back to the stability of familiar record covers, from objects to awaken happy youth memories.</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of emptiness or possessions of material possessions as a kind of consolation," WEZ says.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector, and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "we are like their social workers!" "" "a staff flees from a panel stack." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not listened to them yet.</seg>
<seg id="36">The survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player.</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried, while I smoother a pile of Bossa nova compilations.</seg>
<seg id="38">Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (number of data: three middle aged men) has noticed a "trophy" of the Revival.</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just recently came here and said:" I don't own record players, but I would like to buy a Radiohead sound plate so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says.</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens.</seg>
<seg id="41">More productive, less music-class.</seg>
<seg id="42">"" "we have people who say:" "" "I have no record player." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="43">These are younger people, not older ones, who are only slowly coming in.</seg>
<seg id="44">Pit stop, which has devoted almost an entire floor to the sound plates, has a blower audience than I am in.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women.</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beast's latest synthesizer and sexed pop instead of experimental jazz drens out of loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">None of them looks very lonely, but naive mental traumas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="48">Elanora, 27, has been running around for a few minutes and considers the variety of panels available for sale.</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a window mannequin than a wholesale purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">She doesn't earn much, therefore collecting records is not a real option, she says.</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of records is... "she drives away with a dearest sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">While I am trying to sample the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls grouping around Polaroid cameras for a moment before a father and his daughter are considering buying a crosley record player.</seg>
<seg id="56">On the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection.</seg>
<seg id="57">No one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them.</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "panel art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and could send some customers into the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">It is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates.</seg>
<seg id="61">Even though my research shows that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in record shops in Soho, leave unconsidered the large numbers of female collectors who exist in reality, record stores and online forums.</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">They don't spend their Thursday morning with security with a stroll through record stores of Berwick Street and the sheets through plates while they avoid the staring view of an uncanny, 30-year-old fake presenter, who rises above the shoulders of any middle-aged men.</seg>

<seg id="2">A French court rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle where thousands of refugees live.</seg>
<seg id="3">During a court hearing this week, the authorities argued in Calais that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops where individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, hairdresser services or to sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants.</seg>
<seg id="4">The Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy from which no taxes would be paid and which would lodge a risk of fire and health.</seg>
<seg id="5">Humanitarian groups shared the Court that shops and restaurants are important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="6">They also assumed that temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">A court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were "absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people living" "" "in extremely precarious conditions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer calm meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">One of the places threatened by the tearing was the Jungle Book Kids'Café of the camp, which is operated in charitable ways and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes, as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp.</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids'Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure" "" "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">The two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle camp had risen to over 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in new arrivals during the summer.</seg>

<seg id="2">Germany's racers have to adapt to the next generation speed sensor: in different federal states, among others in Hessen and Brandenburg, new flash units are tested, which should be particularly effective.</seg>
<seg id="3">The futuristic Enforcement Trailer from the company Vitronic from Wiesbaden can be used, for example, at accident sites where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police.</seg>
<seg id="4">For example, on motorway construction sites or renovating bridges with temporary speed limit, there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure that the speed limit is observed.</seg>
<seg id="5">However, a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly.</seg>
<seg id="6">The Enforcement Trailer is self-sufficient: its battery lasts five days with continuous measurement operation, the case data is transmitted encrypted over a modem.</seg>
<seg id="7">With laser measurement technology, all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously.</seg>
<seg id="8">Variable speed limits as well as transit routes by time, travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance at 7-er rugby came to an abrupt halt in the finale on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were hit here in Rio with a result of 43-7.</seg>
<seg id="3">Fiji issued a master class in the handling, side-stepping, back-backs, line-run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color.</seg>
<seg id="4">The defeat was swept through the not too bad price of the silver medal - Britain's fourth this day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa.</seg>
<seg id="5">The marked defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semi-finals on the same day could fall back to them in the final.</seg>
<seg id="6">But regardless of that Fiji would have defeated a 15-man-team in this form.</seg>
<seg id="7">It could be a consolation for the UK - but it probably won't - at least one brite tomorrow will have a gold medal around his neck: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former boss for England from Wimbledon.</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago, she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">This hatch will hurt, but progress is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and took the attacks of GBs out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">It felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if they were running in running buses. the World Series winners went up 5-0 to the top when Osea Kolinisau lit up in the corner.</seg>
<seg id="14">With just four minutes of playing Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner, which he converted.</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">A terrifying topping from Mitchell stopped the mountain of man Leone Nakarawa to achieve a third gate, but Fiji only stopped.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the seventh minute of the race jasa Veremalua in the right corner a touch down and there was 0-17 for GB.</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new since the repudent and there was still over a minute of playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou raged through further weak Tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a fool.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is as if Fiji was born to play the 7, while GB still unlearned.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">GB introduced fundamental changes to half-time and closed the fijian gap... for quite four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time until Joshua ran through Tuisova after a brilliant interim play of Fiji.</seg>
<seg id="24">Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touchdown in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sean sulaner, whose fans sang, flags and danced at the grandstand.</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds.</seg>
<seg id="27">The whistle sounded, the fijis embraced and the UK was crushing crushing in the lawns.</seg>
<seg id="28">Earlier on the day Fiji Japan defeated Japan in the semifinals with 20-5 and Britain pushed South Africa in a tight semi-finals match from the race - Britain's transformation of the difference.</seg>
<seg id="29">Kyle Brown pushed the bucks forward in the first half, but Dan Norton broke through the line with an impressive footwork and scored a door among the posts in the second half.</seg>
<seg id="30">A brilliant late Tackling by Marcus Watson, the brother of Anthony of the English 15-Aside team, secured the win - and thus the silver medal.</seg>

<seg id="3">From the first stroke to the last, 220 hard pieve that enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa.</seg>
<seg id="4">Even though there were only those who were sitting at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was at the same time as she was the second Olympiagold in the twater without a control woman in a row, the first women in the history of British sport that made such a scale.</seg>
<seg id="5">Her dominance was absolute, after all her 39.ter was undefeated, which is also unparalleled.</seg>
<seg id="6">What we see are two brilliant athletins gliding over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the kind of triumph.</seg>
<seg id="7">Behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers that make a difference to the incremental advances that make the difference, and there was no assistant to any assistant than the coach who did not know if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer.</seg>
<seg id="8">As he said he was risky.</seg>
<seg id="9">I had bladder cancer that is operable and they did.</seg>
<seg id="10">If you do not do that, it spreads everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little bit of view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">The trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the break down to a minimum if that was the right term under such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="15">I needed money, so I had to get better back soon.</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">I was in hospital and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough.</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing is a challenge, but it makes it even bigger.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the immediacy of the victory her first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve-raising morning with it a little more than usual, trying to process his own fears.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "panning, being a captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan," "" "I was an emotional wreck this week. that's a bit extreme, but it means so much." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="22">It only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin worked.</seg>

<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even in the last 500 meters when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to lock up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve.</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen summoned "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking to make something wrong.</seg>
<seg id="33">We didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, which we did.</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take time for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">Glover needs to appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV-adventurer Steve Backshall.</seg>

<seg id="2">The managing director of the "Veitenstein Group," Ruppert Göller, retires.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "the association is regarded as" "" "Bavarian-wide exemplary" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="4">A small Franconian drinking water association as a model for the large water producers.</seg>
<seg id="5">This was the name of some time in the original on a contribution by Bayerischer Rundfunk.</seg>
<seg id="6">A little later the water forum of the government of Lower Franconia appreciated the purpose of the association.</seg>
<seg id="7">"" "the work of the Veitenstein group was" "" "Bavarian far as exemplary." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="8">Behind all this Rupert Göller, who was in the prison association for 31 years, has been the managing director for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="9">Now he retired at the age of 65.</seg>
<seg id="10">The water-purpose association of the Veitenstein group, based in Kottendorf, municipality of Breitbrunn, sponsors about 150000 cubic meters of water every year and supplies 32 villages and hamlets with approximately 5500 inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="11">The municipalities are church louder, Breitbrunn, Lauter, Ebelsbach and the town of Baunach.</seg>
<seg id="12">Water supply contracts are available for further towns and municipalities.</seg>
<seg id="13">The current chairman, Breitbrunns Bürgermeisterin Gertrud Bühl (FW), reminded that Rupert Göller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the German Confederation in 1988.</seg>
<seg id="14">"his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work through office and organization activities, budget planning, calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends," said the chairman.</seg>
<seg id="15">As an outstanding event she called the inauguration and inauguration of the new wells (1994), land purchase in the area of the new fountain (1998) and compensation of the farmers, the redevelopment of the elevated tank (1999), the repurchase of a central computer control (2004) and the partial renovations of water pipes.</seg>
<seg id="16">There has been no stalemate and I have always added new additions, because water is life and drinking water is the most important food.</seg>
<seg id="17">In her speech she praised Göllers faithful, reliable and correct service for over 31 years.</seg>
<seg id="18">He has set himself up with a lot of lifeblood for his water-purpose association and he has been regularly living the water-purpose association as if it were his own company.</seg>
<seg id="19">A few weeks ago he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the Veitenstein Group to the nitrate reduction before the water forum of the Lower Franconia region.</seg>
<seg id="20">For that he received very much recognition and praise.</seg>
<seg id="21">Rupert Göller, on the one hand, praised waterwart Alfons Griebel, who worked with him for 28 years.</seg>
<seg id="22">He is the best water man and he was a faithful boy.</seg>
<seg id="23">Together we were an unbeatable team.</seg>
<seg id="24">As highlights from his point of view, he described the construction of the fountain and the restructuring of the purpose association.</seg>
<seg id="25">But the biggest challenge and the most difficult task were the pipe break at the high reservoir at Kirchlouder on a 3rd of January.</seg>
<seg id="26">Here, at minus 17 degrees we had to work throughout the night, so that the villages could be supplied with water.</seg>
<seg id="27">One can only maintain the supply of Neubrunn, because you filled the container from Pettstadt with hoses.</seg>
<seg id="28">The management of the drinking water purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stürmer from Lauter who succeeds Rupert Göller.</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions.</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing installations for so-called self-electricity production in the German steel industry," "" "said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" "" "Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" "" "(WAZ, Friday edition)."

<seg id="8">Gabriel told WAZ that there is now a certificate with the European Commission for talks with Commissary Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">Only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levelling of 20 percent is possible.</seg>
<seg id="10">But even this will not be raised in the steel industry.</seg>

<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">Last year, the situation escalated further, when the world's largest producer in China threw down steel on the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand.</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers reject price dumping in Chinese steel companies.</seg>
<seg id="20">In the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed.</seg>
<seg id="21">On the one hand imported import duties show effects on import steel, on the other hand the economic prospects in China have brightened up.</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price collection is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry leader Thyssenkrupp continued to be cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">Last but not least, prices would have stagnated again.</seg>
<seg id="25">The sector responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">ThyssenKrupp also did not want to exclude closure of individual works.</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 8,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">In July, the German steel producers are cautious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders.</seg>
<seg id="29">At 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the Steel Business Unit announced on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="30">After a short upliftment in May, the produced amount went back to one another for the second month.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure.</seg>

<seg id="1">Community, spirit, health: singing does seniors well</seg>
<seg id="2">Singen has accompanied Ursel Kipp as her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir. she studied music in the school choir, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir.</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing inspires me emotionally and physically," she describes.</seg>
<seg id="4">After a rehearsal she feels balanced, cheerful and a whole more lively, she says.</seg>
<seg id="5">By the way, she does something good for her health and her spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">Because singing is a great hobby for senior citizens from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler of the German Seniorenliga.</seg>
<seg id="7">Most senior citizens sing in choir and share with like-minded the joy of music, describes Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular encounters, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">Because often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so, seniors exercise a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">If you regularly urge your lungs, don't get out of the puffs so quickly in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice in age, singing is an optimal hobby.</seg>
<seg id="15">On older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of Senior Citizens.</seg>
<seg id="16">In the older generations the common singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure, she explains.</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz frequently observes that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through lyrics and especially melodies, people with dementia are sinking long past events.</seg>
<seg id="19">While singing, a special performance is required for the head, explains Lenz.</seg>
<seg id="20">Concentrating simultaneously on one's voice and on a given rhythm and adapting itself to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially older people who live alone exercise not only to concentrate on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through singing in the choir, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">To show yourself: if I practise something for a long time, I become better and waxed beyond myself - this experience reinforces.</seg>
<seg id="26">Good reasons to start singing, so there is enough.</seg>
<seg id="27">Those who want to try out a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks they have little talent, Lenz advises.</seg>
<seg id="28">You don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who can hear when there's a tone next to it?</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer, seniors have different possibilities, says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">If someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors "choir, one can simply join.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Whoever wants to sing in an ecclesiastical choir can turn directly to the church or church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many senior choirs can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">If you don't have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help from the internet research.</seg>
<seg id="35">Anyone wanting to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul well and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="12">On the other hand they were confronted with cries of more excited kittens, which were raised in addition.</seg>

<seg id="13">According to the authorities, the explosive device went into the air in a flower bed in front of the territory of the coastal police.</seg>
<seg id="14">Finally, there were several detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast as well as in Chumphon on the south-east coast several wounded.</seg>
<seg id="15">It was said that there was a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "the bomb attacks carry the same signature," "" "said Army General Danai Kritmethavee, Friday morning before journalists." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">"" "" "" "we assume that it is a co-ordinated attack." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="18">It is too early to express himself to possible motives - but it is probably a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels.</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognise a pattern typical of the bombing of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">The Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks would not be related to the Islamist insurrection or international terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="21">"" "" "" "this is only local sabotage which is limited to restricted areas and provinces," "" "said a spokesman in Bangkok." ""</seg>
<seg id="22">Instead, one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta.</seg>
<seg id="23">In recent days the authorities would have received intelligence evidence of imminent attacks in the south of the country - however, they would not have been informed of the exact time and places.</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">The police used their officials throughout the country to increase security around important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment areas.</seg>
<seg id="26">In Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but they are mostly not directed against tourists.</seg>
<seg id="27">In Hua Hin is a palace that was used over the years of Thailand's King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">After the alleged bombing explosions, the Austrian Foreign Ministry strongly recommends its website to follow the instructions of Thai security agencies.</seg>
<seg id="29">High security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its surroundings.</seg>
<seg id="30">After clashes between the security forces and the Muslim populations, it is not necessary to defile the necessary voyages in these provinces.</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (Level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence even in the years to come.</seg>
<seg id="34">Junta chief and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country is moving towards stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism.</seg>
<seg id="35">The military unta, who had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, is able to keep the kingdom back to stability and order.</seg>
<seg id="36">However, the military did not succeed in getting a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years.</seg>
<seg id="37">More than 6500 people have already been killed in the conflict.</seg>
<seg id="38">Just a year ago, 20 people were killed in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hindu shrine - most of them foreign tourists.</seg>
<seg id="39">It was the bloodiest attack in the recent history of the country.</seg>

<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>

<seg id="1">The fees for each cubic metre of waste water will be 2.10 euros for the area of the Neudorf / Reuth / Welschahl 3.44 sewage plant from October 1, 2016; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (previously 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3.64 euros (previously 2.18 euros).</seg>
<seg id="2">At the facility in Azendorf, the wastewater charge will be increased at the latest if appropriate improvement measures are necessary.</seg>
<seg id="3">After a rough calculation, the waste water price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter.</seg>
<seg id="4">As mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, at the approval of the budget by the Landratsamt Kulmbach, it was found that undercover installations are running for these wastewater facilities.</seg>
<seg id="5">Due to legal foundations, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the equipment cost-effectively.</seg>
<seg id="6">From October 1, 2016, citizens and commercial and industrial companies from Welschahl, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to step deeper into the purse.</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">As Managing Director Herbert Schmidt presented the Board, a new calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary.</seg>
<seg id="9">Over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over and / or overlappings from the previous calculation period are also to be compensated.</seg>
<seg id="10">The serious increase in fees prompted Schmidt that there were relatively small facilities in all three sewage installations with a very low waste water attack, which was between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year.</seg>
<seg id="11">Due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact.</seg>
<seg id="12">Furthermore, the waste water volume in all three plants is slightly declining.</seg>
<seg id="13">Furthermore, in the recumbent cycle period of all three plants, refurbishment and repair expenses were incurred not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses.</seg>
<seg id="14">The facility in Azendorf is nearly 30 years old, the facilities for World Sports, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt noted that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the Azendorf sewage plant.</seg>
<seg id="16">The pump station Welschahl had to be overhauled by the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems and, after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage pond had to be expelled, the sewage sludge had to be disposed of and an additional aeration facility had to be installed in order to meet the water-legal requirements in the future.</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses resulted in continued maintenance and maintenance costs, which must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">The same applies to electricity costs, which were still considerably below the current level in the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012.</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants the expenditures for the operation and maintenance were "fully smashed."</seg>
<seg id="20">In doing so, Schmidt, who had spared the market community of great entertainment costs for sewage installations in the past 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="21">According to stone houses, the situation for the aforementioned installations will continue to remain precarious, especially since the supply area of the Friesenbachtal wastewater utility association is not to be expanded because of its lack of facilities.</seg>

<seg id="1">Snapchat "Anime" effect as an Asian caricature criticised</seg>
<seg id="2">Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to breeds.</seg>
<seg id="3">With its filter tool Snapchat allows approximately 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with identities in such a way that already borders the absurdity.</seg>
<seg id="4">You can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Lichtenstein painting.</seg>
<seg id="5">The filters are unblended, self-propelled tools generating more than 30 million selfies per day.</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages get to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have criticised in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app of Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">When this week suggested a filter to some users who gave them slit eyes, false teeth and bloated cheeks, some critics named a racist caricature of Asians - "yellow face."</seg>
<seg id="9">They wondered if these repeated controversies pointed to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">The news and outrage were widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat told that it would have turned off the feature.</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as cartoon by Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">But outsiders who have experienced racism reminded the filter of hurtful clichés.</seg>
<seg id="13">Others rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">In an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread over the photos, was that the filter was "vulnerable and easy to say."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">It shows that the filter is not safe, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the cutting extreme.</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses these cultural tribunes.</seg>
<seg id="18">The American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand.</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats big audience of young people - who are more diverse than their older opponents - could be more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">If one of Snapchats filters creates a picture that is offensive to a user, "it is much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed when it was the case," said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="21">On Thursday Zhu, who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="22">In an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the modeling practices of Snapchat.</seg>
<seg id="23">Zhu criticised the partially white, only male leadership and ended up with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat.</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no representation of people with other skin colours in their workforce, so they can make such decisions," said the Chinese-American Zhu, "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say something about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">Others share their opinion, a complaint that Snapchat has largely left unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="26">The company publishes no figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>
<seg id="27">On Thursday Snapchat declined to discuss the cultural background of its employees, but according to a speaker, the company has recently hired a personnel responsible, focusing on underrepresented population groups and on internal integration efforts.</seg>
<seg id="28">Zhu also said that she will leave her Snapchat account and added, "I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.K.."</seg>

<seg id="4">The Central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence-related information, which were typically eroded by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly recorded a more positive image of American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on-site were allowed and were consistently positive than analyses of other intelligence agencies," a newspaper article cited the report.</seg>
<seg id="6">"" "" "" "what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "" "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives." ""</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership errors in the CentCom are reaching the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed issues in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">Although there is no direct evidence that government leaders have given instructions under Obama to change the reports, it shows how analysts exposed the pressure from their heads to draw an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "" "" "during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements in front of the congress were significantly more positive than it corresponds to the facts." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="11">For example, a CentCom member announced publicly that a military reconquest of Mossuls could start in April or May 2015.</seg>
<seg id="12">Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "after months of investigations, it is so clear." "" "said Mike Pompeio, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">From the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, Central Command has changed its intelligence reports to play the threat of ISIS in Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights while the investigations are being continued.</seg>
<seg id="17">In addition, further investigations of CentCom reports are in progress by the Chief Inspector of the Defense Ministry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee publicly published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"" "" "" "in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," "" "announced the highest level of democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, Adam B. Schiff, in a statement." ""</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "this process, Mr. Schiff," "" "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," "" "said the moral under analysts and" "" "gave too little room for diverging opinions." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no clues to the intervention of the White House on the CentCom analysts regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">Last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's Chief Inspector, who was taken up after complaints by CentCom analysts.</seg>
<seg id="24">Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, gave a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on the Congress, while the investigations of the General Inspector were still underway.</seg>
<seg id="25">"" "but he also admitted that" "" "experts sometimes have diverging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have reversed the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that has now been made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">The accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions.</seg>
<seg id="28">The criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminiscent of disputes over ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a letter about how the then government under George W. Bush envisaged only a small occupying force in Iraq and had little time pretending to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003.</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the revolt against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">Last year, Mr. Hooker's team stated that contrary to the government's statements, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial position of the terrorist group, since these temporary refineries had been put into operation to sell oil on the black market.</seg>
<seg id="31">This recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September.</seg>
<seg id="32">Centcoms damaliger commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the legislature because of his disproportionately positive assessment of the military situation at a hearing before the Senate.</seg>
<seg id="33">General Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen. Joseph L. Votel at Central Command.</seg>

<seg id="1">The US wins fourth match in the field hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain stands before</seg>
<seg id="2">One day after having shot three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two goals for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0.</seg>
<seg id="3">Five goals in two games were supposed to be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said she couldn't remember it ever done.</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not among the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">However, they know that the Americans are at 4-0 in the olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons at the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan.</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">Both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams from six teams will take the first and second place.</seg>
<seg id="9">The first-placed will take a little longer from the strong Dutch women who lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">As always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have sparked a surprising vortex by their success story, four years after they landed at the last of 12 places at the last London Games.</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">She grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey match in hands (her two older sisters played sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team.</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the 2008 Olympics as she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">In the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team, began to turn things better.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," "" "said Bam." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have completely ripped the rudder.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gates in the first half of the game with a backlash out of the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">India went into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and kept the score from 1 to 0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands.</seg>
<seg id="21">She performed a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and leaked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the US, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games.</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday.</seg>

<seg id="1">Amid the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the Trampolines</seg>
<seg id="2">Wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Rio de Janeiro events feel steady and inevitable, a rapid relay event between competition and aspiration.</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the wristwatch to a swimmer to the gymnast for triathletes.</seg>
<seg id="5">You can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbor's conversation in the coffee shop without hearing Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos.</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock with dimples, could have been among these well-known names that are sent to Prime Time by sponsors and feel-good-TV advertising if he would be a swimmer, gymnast or even fencer.</seg>
<seg id="8">But Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines.</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">Further from the centre, some in the shadow are the sports that are not generally accepted: air guns, archery, badminton, Taekwondo.</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the mammary swimming and may it reign for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">But if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline.</seg>
<seg id="13">Although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, it was perceived as sparsely the last 16 years that many people I asked was not aware of it at all an Olympic sport.</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">Although the USA sent athletes to compete, it has never won a medal in the trampoline jumping and has had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round.</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their Gold Medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">The trampoline jumping has a certain outsider charm, partly because it sounds more appropriate for the unenlightened ear for a clown school than the one for the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="19">At this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a grounded enthusiast.</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humorous potential - the kartoonic trembling of its never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that it essentially combines.</seg>
<seg id="21">The word "trampoline" comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as "springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging winners jump on a giant trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, hocks and saltos) before they land on their feet.</seg>
<seg id="23">They are rated according to official Olympiaprogram according to version, degree of difficulty and "flight time."</seg>
<seg id="24">Twenty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">Medallists in their quest for gold go further, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and down, upwards and downwards on the playground.</seg>
<seg id="27">They hunt not only the finish line or the baseline, but also another scorching goal in the transmission of television: the world or the Olympiarecord.</seg>
<seg id="28">The goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir up even a spectator to tears.</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I think about watching these games as a bit tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">He or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up.</seg>
<seg id="34">There is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during the exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no curvature in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity.</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can be.</seg>
<seg id="36">The qualification and final round of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00.</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the final rounds as part of a afternoon block from 14.00 on both days.</seg>
<seg id="38">In the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general turmoil.</seg>
<seg id="39">If the increase in consciousness can only be achieved through the anthropoids and the objectification of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts recently beat the Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley is expecting his new fan base.</seg>

<seg id="1">"one Generation Protected" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators, calling for political changes in Ethiopia, hit the government's violent resistance.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that many protesters have been killed during clashes with the police in shooting.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just breaking together?</seg>
<seg id="6">Over the past ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy.</seg>
<seg id="7">But in recent months protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">According to human rights organizations, the response of the government was ruthless.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">In circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall.</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Council is now calling for a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," "" "said Rashid Abdi, the project manager of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">American military and intelligence agencies cooperate closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorists across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help.</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">The roads are usually quiet, safe and clean.</seg>
<seg id="19">Although Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organizations have continually led the government to suppress - the opposition in the country has been restricted, with dissidents being effectively silenced.</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven to the desert of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"" "" "" "if you oppress people and have no other options except to protest, it breaks out," "" "said Sejm Teshome, a lecturer in Central Africa." ""</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold on the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">Following a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies got the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament.</seg>
<seg id="27">At the same time the tensions escalate along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line called hundreds of lives in June.</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts are afraid that separatists like the Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, which were forced more or less in recent years, could use the turbulence and arm themselves again.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness are now exploding under the surface after years of biting.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">Only in recent years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and the internet services improved.</seg>
<seg id="32">Even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are residing.</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians reported that they gathered to protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">The second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Orosei and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia.</seg>
<seg id="35">The Orosei and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">Since eons, the Amharas, who are predominantly Christian highlands from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and economy while exploiting the Orosei, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas.</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"" "" "" "we are there to co-ordinate under one umbrella," "" "said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Orosei." ""</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests took place in Amhara and Orosei.</seg>
<seg id="40">Many Amharas and Oromos feel that Ethiopia illegally dominates the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics.</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death in Ethiopia's prime minister until his death in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="43">He was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners.</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly well versed in perceiving early signs of discontent and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"" "" "" "the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "" "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst." ""</seg>
<seg id="46">Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively intransparent reasons to take the position of Mr Meles.</seg>
<seg id="47">Unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South.</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">The last time that Ethiopia has experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting that, according to the analysts, apparently pledged by the government and then stolen.</seg>
<seg id="51">During the ensuing raids many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in recent months, and this time of turmoil passed relatively quickly.</seg>
<seg id="52">Development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction.</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal Missal of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">Last month protesters in Gondar, an amresic city, run by Tigray, attacked shops, and hatred towards the Tigray becomes more and more common in social media.</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests are bringing the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">The American government used Ethiopia as the base for Dronenflights across the neighboring Somalia, even if she recently announced that she closed this base.</seg>
<seg id="58">While the West wants to clearly support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile area.</seg>
<seg id="59">"" "" "" "this," "" "said Mr Abdi," "" "is a very thin tightrope walk." "" "" ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump says his claim Obama was founded ISIS was "sarcasm."</seg>
<seg id="2">Donald J. Trump tried to disperse the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his repeated assertion that President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the "founders" of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant.</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification designed new questions about the communication skills of the Republicans' presidential candidates, whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">It also brings out his comrades who endeavour to take care of him during an eventful period of time, in the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant.</seg>
<seg id="5">After having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening Mr. Trump resigned in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS.</seg>
<seg id="6">But in an early morning Tweet on Friday Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic.</seg>
<seg id="7">The tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he thought the accusation was completely serious.</seg>
<seg id="8">When the conservative radio-orator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS, the Republican presidential candidate would not want to know about it.</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism came down on Mr. Trump, while trying to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling survey values.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">Using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech dull.</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">At the end of July he drew a strong criticism when he said the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained "Of course I thought the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then return to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages are taken by his fans, how they arrive, and then, if necessary," "" "clarify" "" "according to how the reaction falls." "" "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">But I also think he's clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "" "" "instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has accepted an even more corrosive tone as his survey values have gone further." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">A new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado, and head-to-head races in Florida.</seg>
<seg id="20">While Mr. Trump is in general trying not to excuse himself for his provocative statements, he frequently accuses his critics to distort his statements or to misunderstand his humour.</seg>
<seg id="21">But while he is stepping up in the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps has brought his loyal co-workers into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocatively his statements may be.</seg>
<seg id="22">Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent advocates, gave great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "" "" "I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "" "Mr Giuliani said he was asked to do the correctness of Mr. Trumps, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic State." ""</seg>
<seg id="24">It is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them Hinterbänkler, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most mainstream Republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Foreign Minister, allowed ISIS to spread themselves by forcing the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control.</seg>
<seg id="26">Before the election campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of hanging around on each of his words and being prejudiced against him.</seg>
<seg id="27">"" "he ridiculed the" "" "poor, miserable" "" "television experts who try to understand him and said," "" "You can't!" "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trumps for apology than a further proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="2">Verb Cafe was a damaged café in Williamsburg, where you could only pay cash, which had no Wi-Fi but served for 15 years of good coffee.</seg>
<seg id="3">Of course the prices from his Bedford Avenue store were supplanted.</seg>
<seg id="4">The business Soap Cherie, who replaced the verb in the summer of 2014, sells soap in the form of cupcakes.</seg>
<seg id="5">Local people smoked it as the last loss in a gentrifying city.</seg>
<seg id="6">The artist Molly Crabapple wrote on Twitter, "I know New York is change, but I still can't believe that CBGB is dead, the Chelsea Hotel excludes and Verb is now a soap shop."</seg>
<seg id="7">But if New York is changing, then it is also new.</seg>
<seg id="8">A revived verb Cafe opened last November in Greenpoint, less than a mile north of its original location.</seg>
<seg id="9">The new club has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">The new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-standing member of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café.</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working at Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">When a customer offered him to provide funds for a new outdoor table, he was excited to do it, he said.</seg>

<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>
<seg id="18">He introduced new ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="19">On the menu there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese and there are garnish like capers and sautee onions.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are natural rice dishes.</seg>
<seg id="21">The café serves no more beer, but there are fresh juices.</seg>
<seg id="22">After nine months Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers.</seg>

<seg id="24">Recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer.</seg>

<seg id="10">They showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, sleek snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the crash of the stock market crash in 1929.</seg>
<seg id="11">Brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate.</seg>

<seg id="19">In the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet.</seg>

<seg id="37">"he liked continental cuisine like fish with cucumber sauce," Coe said.</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in an almost gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was terribly realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">President Roosevelt might have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to make an example with his stomach.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's hair usually only comes to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the Sanna research vessel.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-haiahs only get offspring with 150 years.</seg>
<seg id="7">Leisurely the Greenland-shark swims along the basis of the North Atlantic, in an hour it comes on average just 1,220 meters far.</seg>
<seg id="8">Only when it depends on it, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to satte 2,6 km / h - and with this top speed is half as fast as a seal.</seg>
<seg id="9">This lifestyle shaped by Langsamkeit appears to be a panacea for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal "Science" in any case from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "" "" "madness," "" "said Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock this life span, which represents a world record for vertebrates." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist presumed that Greenland's hair would become stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">Greenland's sharks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface.</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland's sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow motion measured it, when they fitted six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard.</seg>
<seg id="18">The loot nevertheless makes this sharks: in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear.</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadavers, which tortol from higher water-layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-sharks, fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">The smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured.</seg>
<seg id="22">In order to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method.</seg>
<seg id="23">This centre of the eye lens is formed before the birth of the sharks, the protein contained in it will no longer be renewed.</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably a lot of carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">Their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons attempts to spin greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="26">In the third smallest animal with its length of 220 centimeters, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, so it should have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the other hand, all larger Greenland-sharks had normal carbon-14-quantities in their lentius, which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">In fact, the carbon-14-clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeters long Greenland shark, while the record shark with 502 centimeters could even be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was well-known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to associate the length of an old age.</seg>
<seg id="31">Since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-sharks with the multiplication become apparent at least one and a half centuries.</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methusalemes live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">Also the record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska.</seg>
<seg id="35">Due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there frequently also runs on asparagus.</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">In order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very large.</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on having as many offspring as possible as soon as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein.</seg>
<seg id="42">A very large animal should, on the other hand, invest his resources in a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Claude Lanzmann, author of the Holocaust documentary "Shoah," left his anger at the Kempinski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FAZ.</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way for a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="5">Various pilgrimages were examined and one finally decided for the Bishop's city of Freiburg, where during the Holy Year of Mercy with the open gate of mercy to the Freiburg Minster, a special pilgrimage destination was offered.</seg>
<seg id="6">16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch, and the rooms of Heiligenstadt, were on their way.</seg>
<seg id="7">In the evening before, pastor Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the pilgrimages and informed the pilgrim's blessing.</seg>
<seg id="8">Von Horb was driven by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Muenster Unserer's wife stands and so the pilgrim's way from Münster was started.</seg>
<seg id="9">Each day and evening the individual tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers, songs and texts.</seg>
<seg id="10">But also on the way, the Minis made bells, chapels and churches again and again in order to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgrim song.</seg>
<seg id="11">The parishes of the local parishes were at their disposal for the nights.</seg>
<seg id="12">Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller were on the stage for a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team-Sprint in the Velodrom in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">The 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own. the Jumping and made the legend proud when he stormed home to get a victory from the favorites New Zealand.</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago, while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took Hoys in March at the London Underground World Championships despite the resignation of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">His retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that now unfolds.</seg>
<seg id="10">Hindes, Kenny - who won with Hoy four years ago - and Skinner won the qualifying rounds in the qualifying rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round.</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">After his lap, Behind was barely back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">A change of strategy made a big part of the transformation, in which Hindes drove in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep the pace.</seg>
<seg id="14">Hoy saw from his position as BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hindes, when they climbed onto the podium.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the 23-year-old Glasgow Skinner said:" "" "it is a flattering comparison." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="16">I am only here to do my best and to make a name for myself.</seg>
<seg id="17">In the final round we have set up an Olympic chord and the World Champion defeated.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">After the triumph in 2012 on the Kennies and Hoys side, Hindi said that after a weak start he fell on the track.</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no acquittal of England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">With such an outstanding victory this time there was no such problem.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "said Hindes:" "" "it feels like London with all the UK flags." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">This is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London.</seg>
<seg id="27">If that is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle stream.</seg>
<seg id="28">With the form of Kenny it is in the realm of possibility that he repeats the victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition.</seg>
<seg id="29">This would be for Kenny - the exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23 (a apparently holy date for the British sport; on the day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal.</seg>
<seg id="30">This would be the same by Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the sprint, starting today and going over three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"" "the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "" "I only enjoy this for the moment." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"" "Hindes said," "" "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="37">It was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometre race.</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51,942.</seg>
<seg id="40">The world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was at 3: 51,659.</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">He had fought with representatives before the qualification yesterday when officials called him to measure his height.</seg>
<seg id="43">In the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and ended tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260.</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a pair of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">After a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio were shut down.</seg>
<seg id="46">Dramas withdrew in the background, such as the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April, in the midst of the dominance and mobbing allegations as well as the retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton.</seg>
<seg id="47">But when one looks at the first evening of the competition in Velodrom it looks like the legendary reputation of GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again.</seg>

<seg id="2">The future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workplaces of workers - are at stake as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thus will raise all supply contracts as the delivering energy company announced.</seg>
<seg id="3">This step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant.</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years expires in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the alcoa plant in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No fewer than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be at risk during a closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">In addition, it could come to domino effects as the enamel consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victoria.</seg>
<seg id="8">In 2014 Alcoa melted the Point Henry Schmeling, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year.</seg>
<seg id="9">The melting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation regarding the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant.</seg>
<seg id="11">AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting facility with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three more owners will announce their contracts.</seg>
<seg id="12">The plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "AGL assumes that the plant in Portland continues to operate, which means further physical demand for electricity by melting," "" "said the company." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "AGL still said that the treaties were so-called" "" "security transactions" "" "that should come into force in November 2016." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a period of 12 months, so they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "" "" "hence, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "" "said the power supplier." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential effects on the revenue of AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong futures markets for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL shared with the fact that the value of the contracts had already been written down in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to withdraw the contracts, the "Ability Alcoas... to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the enamel" is not impaired.</seg>
<seg id="20">The US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Loy Yang, who would have entered into force from November this year, even if it is still a declaration of why it has resigned from the contract.</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">Referring to the analysts' statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland will consume around 600 megawatts per year and consume around 900 megawatts of electricity per year.</seg>
<seg id="23">Should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market].</seg>
<seg id="24">And that's not good for us as a generator, "he said.</seg>

<seg id="6">This represents the cliché act of almost every birthday party of a children's show (Seacre brought the phrase, "You thought we had forgotten you?," with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate in this publicity somehow.</seg>

<seg id="8">Kendal's big sister Kim like her, as regards the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself.</seg>

<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is expected to be so eagerly anticipated that in the last two years pictures of the magazine have been filtered out before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">Women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss.</seg>
<seg id="13">Over the past few years there were clearly more "celebrities who like" as "models that are celebrities" on the cover.</seg>
<seg id="14">Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor.</seg>
<seg id="15">But even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the "breakthrough model" of her generation - falls under the previous category, she is in good company.</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good Snapchat video (even though everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">Beyonce, which appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade.</seg>

<seg id="2">The upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September 4) and Berlin (September 18) are notable for the SPD and the CDU ruling party.</seg>

<seg id="4">While the red-black government coalition could still further govern in the north, this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="5">In both federal states, however, the SPD would be the strongest party and would have had a good chance of continuing the head of government.</seg>
<seg id="6">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern the SPD plummeted from 35.6 percent five years ago to 24 percent.</seg>
<seg id="7">According to the survey, the party only smiled shortly before the CDU, which could come back to 23 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">The third place is disputed between the left and the AfD.</seg>
<seg id="9">The left would come to 19 percent (previously 18.4 percent), the AfD would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="10">The Greens hesitated again in the Schwerin Landtag despite slight losses of 6 percent (previously 8.7 percent).</seg>
<seg id="11">NPD and FDP would not be represented in the parliament with 3 per cent each.</seg>

<seg id="4">The tool weighed almost half a kilo and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand either.</seg>
<seg id="6">On the contrary, it was quite palpable.</seg>
<seg id="7">The built-in memory initially was eight megabytes, which would be enough today for about two selfies with high resolution.</seg>

<seg id="9">"" "the" "" "Nokia 9000 Communicator" "" "arrived exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in stores - and it was the first smartphone." ""</seg>
<seg id="10">For a few euros fans can buy the equipment still on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the internet age.</seg>
<seg id="11">20 years ago, however, communicator was a sensation.</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as an office in western pocket format.</seg>
<seg id="13">In fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for those standards at that time: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, also via fax the communicator was reached.</seg>
<seg id="14">Even access to web pages was possible by HTML browser, albeit agonizing slowly.</seg>
<seg id="15">A calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar.</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then we found a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">Quite proud was the price: 2700 D-Mark, so about 1400 Euros.</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody was able to suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would become the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably habitable according to the projections of a new NASA climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus on the basis of tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">The model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere might have erroneous conditions once created.</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">But the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and still slowly proceeded.</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">The planet probably showed more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from rapid evaporation.</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation, the slow rotation of the Venus exponentially increases her daily life of the sun for almost two months," stated GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release.</seg>
<seg id="11">This warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts as an umbrella to shield the surface from a large portion of the solar heat.</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees colder than that of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus, similar to the evolution that was previously assumed by planet scientists.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although it was probably inhabitable, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions of years.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was fired from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">As their hydrogen escaped only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide back with a deadly greenhouse effect -- Venus, which we know today.</seg>
<seg id="17">The researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in the Geophysical Research Letters.</seg>

<seg id="5">Before the seventh day of competition, the first official doping attacks have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="6">Chinese floats Chen Xinyi, 3000-Meter-Obstetractor Silwia Danekova from Bulgaria and Polish Weightlifter Adrian Zielinski were tested positively in Brazil and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the critically eyed athletics competitions.</seg>
<seg id="7">Last Sunday, the diuretic hydrochlorothiazide was detected in Chen, which is used as a masked medium for doping substances.</seg>
<seg id="8">The International Sports Court CAS confirmed its expulsion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon local time.</seg>
<seg id="9">On Sunday, the 18-year-old ranked 4th in the finals over 100 m of butterflies, only at 0.09 seconds she missed the bronze medal.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Friday, Chen would have participated in the courses over 50 m Freestyle.</seg>
<seg id="11">The International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested the opening of the B trial and a hearing.</seg>
<seg id="12">"" "the national association takes the matter" "" "very serious and requires a full cooperation in the investigations," "" "said Xinhua from a message:" "" "we will work together with the International Sports Court CAS and will accept the verdict." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="13">For the first time in history, the IOC, but the CAS, is responsible for the sanction of athletes with positive cases.</seg>
<seg id="14">Also in the night of Rio the news broke over the positive rehearsal at Danekova, the 33-year-old went on the offensive himself.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "" "" "I had three tests, all negative, and my fourth test was positive," "" "this was an incredible shock," "" "she said to the Bulgarian TV station BNT." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "it is innocent," "" "the only explanation could be dietary supplements," "" "explained the Athletics." ""</seg>
<seg id="17">According to the report, it is said to be the banned substance of the EPO blood doping agent.</seg>
<seg id="18">Danekova has been suspended, according to BNT, the B-rehearsal should have already been positive.</seg>
<seg id="19">Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borissov promptly contacted the Athenians' criticism.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "" "" "I don't understand why athletes do not draw the right conclusions," "" "he said," "" "we Bulgarians are under observation, so many have been excluded." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">For example, all weight lifters from the chronically doping nation may not participate in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="22">On Friday the case of Adrian Zielinski, the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg, was tested positively on the anabolic steroid Nandrolon three days earlier.</seg>
<seg id="23">Both contest the intake, both of them must not start in the class up to 94 kg.</seg>
<seg id="24">Before starting the athletes, the case Danekova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport.</seg>
<seg id="25">The IAAF world association banned the entire Russian team up to an exception because of systematic doping, also the Lofernation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="26">In swimming, the previous contracts in China also ensured violent confrontations among athletes.</seg>
<seg id="27">The Frenchman Camille Lacourt picked up the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Yang hard.</seg>
<seg id="28">"sun Yang pinkelt purple."</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "when I see the podium more than 200 m Freestyle, I want to hand over myself," "" "said Lacourt on the French radio." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">Sun was also the focal point of a debate with the Australian Mack Horton.</seg>
<seg id="31">"" "" "" "I have no time and no respect for doping scammers," "" "he said." ""</seg>
<seg id="32">Sun was positive in 2014 at the Chinese nationals on the stimulant Trimetazidin, but had to sit down only for a three month lock.</seg>

<seg id="1">Data lau: as perfide grouting hackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmailing-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">According to a recent survey conducted by the malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes of 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, partially multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software.</seg>
<seg id="4">In Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom salvings required by the perpetrators in order to be able to re-use the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The offenders specialize their blackmail software according to the observation of Malwarebytes from attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">If they are successful there, the potentially causing ransom is much higher than with private users.</seg>
<seg id="8">"" "" "" "we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malicious software," "" "explains Malwarebytes Head Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the" "" "world." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="9">In 2008, most of the malware programmes were still designed to send advertising.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmailing software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">Only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred quickly in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word, Excel or database files, as well as archives of images and videos.</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">Subsequently, the software presents the demands of blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">To get the final turnkey code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - usually in the form of the Cryptocurrency Bitcoin.</seg>
<seg id="16">However, where the personal photo database is at stake in private users, companies are dealing with sensitive customer data or project databases without stopping production.</seg>
<seg id="17">Accordingly, the damage drops when a ransomware falls.</seg>
<seg id="18">22 percent of the affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt operations, in case of a case, people were in danger of life.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Germany several hospitals were already victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: do not pay, it only encourages the problem," explains Kleczynski.</seg>
<seg id="21">But 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data back.</seg>
<seg id="22">For managers it is difficult to reject the claim of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build up a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build up a kind of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">They explain their victims via chat, as they can pay via Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt sample files for free.</seg>
<seg id="26">And if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to return their data unencrypted.</seg>
<seg id="27">Given the potentially high and relatively low-risk earnings from ransomware blackmail, the hackers become more professional and share the job, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos: "a single person can write a ransomware about within a week."</seg>
<seg id="28">However, it is more likely that these are three or four persons.</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers then sell their malware in the form of a software package to the actual blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="30">The malware kits have been developed by buying malware, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in delivery is a fitting tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski.</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackers then look for further hackers to spread the newly purchased software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service industry.</seg>
<seg id="34">So one logs in one of the forums on the underground, buys the set of a criminal and instructs another to install the software on as many PCs as possible.</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is per infected computer.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually the criminals then instruct Spammer to spread," Wisniewski explains.</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that better secure their data.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies IT managers in the Malwarebytes survey trust that they can avert ransomware by means of file back-ups and scanner software.</seg>
<seg id="39">Accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies.</seg>
<seg id="40">"" "" "" "if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations," "" "explains Malwarebytes Head Marcin Kleczynski." ""</seg>
<seg id="41">This makes the damage potential much higher than before, depending on the type of data.</seg>
<seg id="42">In the future, the perpetrators could also take completely new targets on the internet of things on the grain.</seg>
<seg id="43">On the Defcon hacker conference, safety researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermostat connected to the Internet under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a blocked heating could well be worthy of a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">If the culprits then instead of heating in the future block an entire production line in a factory, Ransomware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">In the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupe and also the versatility of a mini van.</seg>
<seg id="4">Sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life.</seg>
<seg id="5">Although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the rear, it does not work closely at any point.</seg>
<seg id="6">The materials of the interior are well finished and seem pleasant, only the cockpit upper side drops slightly.</seg>

<seg id="9">This is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like chin-seats and thus offer storage space, which is 1,24 m high from the floor to the ceiling.</seg>
<seg id="10">The trunk can be loaded well, but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than at the comparable Peugeot 2008.</seg>
<seg id="11">The 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">He should do his job a little quieter though.</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4,7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">The driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamism and comfort.</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"" "the equipment in the top version" "" "Executive" "" "leaves nothing to be desired." ""</seg>
<seg id="19">The safety systems include the City emergency braking assistant (works up to Tempo 32), the collision warning system and the lane support assistant.</seg>
<seg id="20">"" "the collision warning sometimes irritates because it evaluates many obstacles as" "" "approaching objects" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="21">The remote light assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to the traffic sign recognition and throttles the speed if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="23">But full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more.</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB- and one HDMI jack are below the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="25">The roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine.</seg>
<seg id="26">Those who do not want to invest so much will receive the petrol engine from 20000 euros, diesel from 23,000 euros.</seg>

<seg id="2">It stalls regularly on the bypass road - here a picture of November.</seg>
<seg id="3">But this is to change: the rule of law shall be extended.</seg>
<seg id="4">This is a good news for all car drivers who stand in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in the traffic jam, when they drive over the motorway for Zubringer (A 43).</seg>
<seg id="5">The road construction continues on Tuesday and Wednesday (16 / 17 August) in the area between Hammer Street and Departure Weser Straße the legal bending track by 700 meters.</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">In the evening, one rolls around eternally; at night, one is awake for hours, in the morning it is far from the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep.</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">After all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adult sleep disorders and more than ten per cent feel their sleep often or permanently than not relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="5">What are sleeping problems or sleep disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">There are several forms of sleep disorders, and they can be underpinned by diverse causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wedel, member of the board of the German Society of Sleeves and Sleep Medicine.</seg>
<seg id="7">What you can see below, is the insomnia, i.e. an entry and sleep disorder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Just through sleep many people find themselves as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board member of the German Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony region of Varel.</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">Behind this can be organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication.</seg>
<seg id="12">Infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease.</seg>
<seg id="13">"" "" "" "very early wake-up is common with a depression," "" "says Wedel." ""</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">Who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wake up every two to three hours and possibly starts to salute about everyday problems and worries, there is an example.</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should I go to a doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">Those who do not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights per week should go to the doctor, advises weaving.</seg>
<seg id="19">The impairment may look quite different: one is beaten, tired, undressed, has difficulty with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or bodily discomfort such as stomach or headache.</seg>
<seg id="20">In order to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes.</seg>
<seg id="21">As treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks - inquired.</seg>
<seg id="22">There is hardly any recessed sleep mediator in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the inter-disciplinary centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="23">Therefore, in case of sleeping problems one should contact the general practitioner first, advises weaving.</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep lab, and what happens there?</seg>
<seg id="26">For example, in the sleep lab, doctors advise doctors in snoring with respiratory infections, in case of disease tiredness, sleepwalkers or if you do not find the cause of sleep disorders, explains Fietze.</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "" "" "please do not take a nap," "" "says Fietze." ""</seg>
<seg id="30">After gluing, one goes to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">Besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a sensor at the finger.</seg>
<seg id="32">In addition, a camera on the ceiling draws up the bedroom.</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">It counts: regular sleep and uptime, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcohol and do not look at night at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive.</seg>

<seg id="2">Professional thieves at Düsseldorf Airport</seg>
<seg id="3">The Düsseldorf police officers were arrested on Thursday by two women and two men aged 50 to 61.</seg>
<seg id="4">The suspect had committed several handkerchiefs and luggage steels as gangs.</seg>
<seg id="5">At 21.30, civil servants at the airport of Düsseldorf recognized a gang that was known to the policemen from past theft charges.</seg>
<seg id="6">Since the middle of July this year, the two women and two men had committed several crimes and, in doing so, had proceeded professionally and professionally.</seg>
<seg id="7">The Specialists of the Crime Commissariat 34 can prove four deeds to the thieves submitted to Germany specifically for the provision of criminal offences.</seg>
<seg id="8">They had captured a total of over 15,000 Euro.</seg>

<seg id="1">The Riga road in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not seem the same at first sight, but the police is one of the "dangerous places" of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2">When one goes along the road from east to west, one passes through playgrounds, a frescoed kindergarten and a biolade.</seg>
<seg id="3">"" "someone has" "" "ugly!" "" "on the façade of a grey house." ""</seg>
<seg id="4">Compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, it is already being built: until 2017 there will be a house with high windows and 133 new apartments.</seg>
<seg id="5">"" "article about this" "" "trendy neighborhood" "", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferably illustrated with burning cars in recent weeks." ""</seg>
<seg id="6">The reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have lease agreements, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events.</seg>
<seg id="7">Since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin inner senator handle had spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project, the area designated as a "no-go zone" for policemen and 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence.</seg>
<seg id="8">After evacuating the rooms on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers on June 22nd, the police patrolled out official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on-site, locked parts of the road and refrained from entering the house with the number 94.</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the building workers commissioned the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">On 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal, and one day later, police and construction workers followed the jubilation of sympathisers and residents.</seg>
<seg id="11">On this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are chatting vorm late.</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">Left violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in the Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who has grown here three children, are mainly annoyed by the police presence.</seg>
<seg id="14">With the inhabitants of the house projects they share concern with increasing rents and gentrification.</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez, who mostly wanted police protection against vandalism.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trench, which the Berlin senator and the police put up between house occupants and their neighbours, obviously does not exist.</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional worker's quarter, which also today compared to the rest of the city has a low average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">House occupations and the native housing projects have long been part of the Kiez neighborhood: in 1990 numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including almost the entire Mainzer Straße in the vicinity of the Riga.</seg>
<seg id="19">While the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police regulations in a regular street battle, many of the projects in Riga were legalized and partly still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time, in recent years, the city district has become a magnet for tourists and balers from all over the world. residents of GDR times and former home-occupiers now share their neighbourhood with them.</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the new buildings in Riga are attacked as symbols for this development: one recognizes them at thrown slices or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color-bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">"" "no other road was mentioned this year as often together with the words" "" "left autonomous violence" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="24">One reason that not all neighbours look at it as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body injury tend to be almost exclusively directed against policemen.</seg>
<seg id="25">Most of the offenses make damage that tends to make new buildings and newly renovated houses.</seg>
<seg id="26">For Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenant next to the disputed 94 years ago, there can be no talk of uncertainty.</seg>
<seg id="27">As for violence, it is weighty: the people in the 94 are their neighbours who are not destined to be.</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in Riga anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">For the studied architecture her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary: "here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer has deliberately moved into the Riga-Straße - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">That is why it was also so important that the residents get back their streets: from the police, politics and media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty over the borough.</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former buildings that displace the old inhabitants.</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "" "" "these are ultimately property-apartments which are not interesting for many here - people prefer people who are not so well contaminated," "" "she says." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "" "" "I cannot approve violence and destruction." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">There is frustration on all sides, including the police and the residents.</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for people who are fond of color bombs: the skin projects and the left scene were part of the Kiez neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="38">Who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a pub district, can complain about noise there.</seg>
<seg id="39">All persons presented only with first names have asked not to be called by their correct name.</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugee commissioner</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person for integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">She is also a social worker on site.</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuschle is the refugee commissioner for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogue supports the team of Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">It sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, working group, refugee aid, administration, authorities and who else is involved.</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is here, the eiving woollen-sow, which is above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">Thus some - less mocking than rather on the multitude of desired tasks - meant when the administration wanted to write down the place.</seg>
<seg id="9">We were looking for a management team with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an eiving lust for wool.</seg>
<seg id="10">But administrative work is not their central area, says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="11">Above all, it is about organization, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activity.</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"" "" "" "it was high time," "" "says Regine client that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players." ""</seg>
<seg id="15">There are big and small problems, organizational, human and understanding problems.</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the Wasenstraße</seg>
<seg id="17">A serious problem has been for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">The costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves.</seg>
<seg id="21">Responsibility changes from the councils of councils to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search for some time has been very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto, the administration does not find private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">It didn't work until now, so it is necessary to rely on private apartments, so Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="26">Therefore, community apartments must be considered as it is so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">Perspective is the keyword, Regine client and Annika Deuschle agree.</seg>
<seg id="30">In addition to a fixed stay there are internships, training centres, school sites, single-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be undone or set up.</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="32">Many work in the building yard or help house masters, do charitable work - and that motivates and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reports.</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "this is" "" "no employment therapy." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">The day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and client.</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">So there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses.</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So administration and volunteers also jump here.</seg>
<seg id="41">"" "" "" "it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome in Germany and welcome." ""</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">They have to explain to the refugees that it takes just and they can make sense for the time, for example with language courses.</seg>
<seg id="44">Who at some point develop the feeling that he cannot help nobody in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, he will never be integrated.</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">But there is also problem cases, says customer honestly, "people who do nothing at all." the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others.</seg>
<seg id="47">"" "all this is already a" "" "mammoth task." "" "" ""</seg>
<seg id="48">A difficult question: do the two after the recent incidents fear radicalisation, even in a small community like Urbach?</seg>
<seg id="49">"" "" "" "no," "" "says Regine customer quite clearly," "" "what some may call naïve." "" "a residual risk cannot and does not want to exclude it." ""</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They were afraid that the assassins would bring them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine client.</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honourable volunteers must look out for activities in the region and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always in the background that soon a new push to refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">To answer this question clearly, politics is afraid.</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to put them on site.</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not yet arrived in Urbach where we want to go," says Annika Deuschle.</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees, that would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urgbacher is already busy to integrate the present people wisely.</seg>
<seg id="63">These are currently around 100 people, mostly young men.</seg>
<seg id="64">But when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree.</seg>
<seg id="65">The political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers.</seg>
