Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu isn &apos;t just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
but the encounter is also intended to address the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed .
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington critic@@ ises Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal of the Iranian nuclear program promoted by Obama has further wor@@ sen@@ ed the relationship between the two .
in March , at the invitation of the Republi@@ cans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu had held a controversial talk , which was partly considered an aff@@ ront to Obama .
the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with reference to the upcoming election in Israel .
Professor to have shot his girl@@ friend in an emergency call
in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girl@@ friend and that the officials had to come to his home .
Lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; cute dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
inside the house the officials found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note scri@@ b@@ bling on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb .
there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already travelled 300 miles to the school premises , where according to the police information he shot and killed a popular historian , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office .
Delta State University Poli@@ ti@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb has made the fatal emergency call some@@ time after that .
until the end of the day there was another death : Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
one day after the sho@@ ot@@ ings in the university , students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb was motivated .
the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped draw a picture of a talented yet possibly difficult teacher .
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ce died , said he has no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Schmidt himself mentioned Lamb in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students attended courses of both .
at the same time there were some tendencies into problematic behavi@@ ours .
a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a bit nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 .
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university employment policy meant that the promotion for which Lamb had worked so hard for him would not constitute a guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant Professor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bert &apos;s lane when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as .
before he could be arrested , Lamb slain himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner methane Johnson .
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that he believed that he knew the people who lived there .
Lamb has grown up in the area .
Lamb started his work at the university , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy .
he obtained his doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
one of the long @-@ term girl@@ friends Lam@@ bs called him intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny .
Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and he was 20 when they met together with friends .
she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing .
he was the flock of women at that time .
all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and resident in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on .
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but there was no evidence of a marriage . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said the dog was fine .
the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and blues .
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came both on a summer fair three years ago .
later they played one or other gig together .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings their own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse , who worked online for various companies .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes enter@@ tain@@ er at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience ended .
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said .
we were clean up and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
Schmidt , the dead professor , headed the first semester seminar program and speci@@ alises in American native and colonial history , &quot; said Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at the school .
he was married and had three children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his bro@@ therhood and the student committee .
on Tuesday evening , around 900 people attended the Delta State campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and attended a candle light commemor@@ ative ceremony , including teachers , staff , students and members of the congregation .
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the mic watch , while the Univers@@ it√§@@ tsch@@ or &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; sang .
the lessons will be res@@ um@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report .
this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call after he killed Schmidt , and that he claimed Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his emergency call , but there is no indication that the two had ever married .
Toys R Us are planning to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
Toys R Us say that there will not be as many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the currently employed staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours .
the company said that it is planning to employ 4@@ 0,000 people in stores and distribution centers all over the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were hired .
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees that sell , ship and deliver products .
Michael J. Fox sh@@ akes his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of Back to the Future was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot;
the film starts , and it comes to mind that I am a simul@@ ated y@@ aw@@ ning and an arm &apos;s length from being with the princess of Wales on a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd , as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg .
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premier@@ ed 30 years ago .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s really for me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the biggest time travel movie ever shot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October .
UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
Secretary General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon states his response to Russia &apos;s increased military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the conflict lasting almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people .
the UN boss once again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive talks to find a political solution .
B@@ an said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the fr@@ inge of the meeting of the General Assembly of the AG@@ M this month to discuss the situation in Syria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he de@@ pl@@ ored that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot; &quot; &quot;
8 survey values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have done it as a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
but no matter how some Republi@@ cans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks when poll@@ ing down , it has ( yet ) not working .
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some start to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ rin &apos;s leadership was given to the Ris@@ ing Her@@ man Cain , none of whom also won a state in the nom@@ ination process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth are now recogni@@ zing Tr@@ um@@ ps staying power and starting to drop their dollars to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
tr@@ um@@ ps Ar@@ bit@@ r@@ ary values have turned 180 degrees .
shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey from the Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two out of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positively .
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent .
now , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa concluded last week that 60 percent of Republi@@ cans have a good view of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P vote would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
in a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ cans said they were either &quot; delighted &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated .
only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if he were the candidate .
only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 per cent say they were &quot; thr@@ illed &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) .
the next in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with just 21 percent .
on the other hand , 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they are &quot; un@@ happy &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would become a candidate .
a majority of Republi@@ cans don &apos;t see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament as a problem .
while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive say@@ ings , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday .
the same number counts in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the State of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ cans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week .
nevertheless , 44 percent believe that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of 10 independent say that his temper@@ ament didn &apos;t fit into the White House , so ABC / Post .
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
when they set up their schol@@ ar hats , Republi@@ can elec@@ tors hold Tr@@ ump for real .
when asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet after a pol@@ l of CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week .
this is a change since when four of ten end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : in the past , GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
at this point in the last cycle , four of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P voters Tr@@ um@@ ps Camp@@ aig@@ n is considered plau@@ sible .
even if the Republi@@ cans were gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump is beating almost everybody .
some experts point out that the fragmented field probably contributes to tr@@ um@@ ps leadership while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump @-@ support is spread to more than a dozen other candidates in diff@@ use .
but a pol@@ l at the Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump re@@ aps the majority support .
he points to Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points .
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hypo@@ the@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their mind .
a new survey by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tr@@ ump say they have firmly established their votes .
of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind .
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
nonetheless Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competi@@ tor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as common for tr@@ ump .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his campaign of campaig@@ ning two months ago &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immig@@ rant from Mexico was the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump vital His@@ pan@@ o Americans will be with@@ held from the Republi@@ can Party and will damage the re @-@ orientation efforts .
but according to the new ABC / Post pol@@ l of Monday , six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on immigration issues .
so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ ight , it seems to be Donald Tr@@ ump to do .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the fru@@ stration of the government is climbing on new high@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
meanwhile , Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all by their out@@ si@@ ders status .
six out of 10 Republi@@ cans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience .
and they are fur@@ ious at Washington .
a survey conducted by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ cans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; un@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; in@@ cont@@ ented . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg there is the most expensive urban@@ ization - with a view over the North Sea att .
in the street one square meter of a rec@@ ti@@ fier house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Sy@@ lt , the offer of objects is limited naturally , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter costs the most .
of course , 18,@@ 70 Euro per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little .
in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , however , one of the prices is like Pe@@ an@@ uts .
the estate service provider Angel &amp; V√∂l@@ kers has published a ranking list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
there are several tens of thousands of Euros - per square meter .
but good , who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is not at the top here as an exception .
champ@@ ions League : Bavaria &apos;s dream start thanks to M√ºller and G√∂tz@@ e
double door guard in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas M√ºller just has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas M√ºller eb@@ led the FC Bayern the path to a deser@@ ved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then it ran .
a sovereign pr@@ el@@ ude to the Champions League season .
world champ@@ ions Thomas M√ºller and Mario G√∂tz@@ e have embark@@ ed on a dream start in the &quot; Mission Milan &quot; by FC Bayern in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ ra@@ eus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to M√ºll@@ ers Doppel@@ packs ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and G√∂tz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9. ) earned with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth start @-@ up in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to get the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
in his 28th matches in the Champions League to the Bavarian leadership , M√ºller received ben@@ evol@@ ent assistance from Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who suffered a shot of the world champion as a flan@@ k .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bayern captain Philipp L@@ ah@@ m before the game at Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich held word . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated performance without gl@@ it@@ ating .
Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his youngest six home games in the kingdom class , including famous clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ √©@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin .
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
but the Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim .
they bol@@ dly ran , but in their offensive efforts they often found worth@@ less works .
the attacks were initiated too often by reloc@@ ation to the left side of Douglas Costa , which was rarely crossed against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Mu@@ eller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the upper left corner of the tor@@ so .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski had the best opportunities in half one .
first , Olympic ak@@ os stri@@ ker Ide@@ a Brown proposed the Pol@@ es &apos;s head ball from the line ( 26 . ) .
then by direct withdrawal , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ked with his knee ( 35 . ) .
although the Bav@@ arians moved their usual dominant game , Pi@@ ra@@ eus was able to set needle stit@@ ches .
but Manuel Neu@@ er was deser@@ ted .
thus , when he ran a shot of Ide@@ a on the l@@ at ( 5@@ 6th ) .
ahead of Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola left a chain with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it well .
Mario G√∂tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ re , sat outside .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after the final training the World Cup hero gave the green light after the final session , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Officer Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you want to make something different from it , this is already vi@@ cious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
also at the first change Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to the slaugh@@ tered Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) .
i@@ dol arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o V@@ idal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made everything clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter M√ºller still sat on it .
in front of the game , it was at the stadium in Kra@@ w@@ ale .
after a smaller group of partly war@@ med Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of host Pi@@ ra@@ eus with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich followers .
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth
those who smoke , damage not only the lung , but also the teeth - this suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study .
the good news : in doing so , risk decreases quickly .
smo@@ kers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
this is the result of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam .
compared to non @-@ smo@@ kers , smo@@ kers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ Fa@@ che .
the scientists observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
tooth decay causes tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E .
smoking is a risk factor for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , empha@@ sizing the authors .
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is therefore reduced to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smo@@ kers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking also increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk however within a short time , write the researchers in the Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , it could take more than ten years before the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of non @-@ smo@@ kers , explan@@ tor Thomas Dietrich from the English University of Birmingham .
&quot; &quot; &quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smo@@ kers , explained study director H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; smoking shor@@ tens life time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
smoking is good for lungs and vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health and age .
in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years of age was affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared .
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet on the banks of Cologne on rem@@ n@@ ants of the late Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the second time .
near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday .
since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are looking for so @-@ called ground monuments .
for all construction projects in the municipal area of Cologne , the museum is always considered a department of archae@@ ology soil conservation .
in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards , archae@@ ologists have now become five .
it was already known from text documents that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , described Trier .
in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with about 350 tom@@ bs was also discovered , which probably belonged to the church .
young woman covered by freight train
after a young woman is left at the station in the s@@ cour@@ ge lanes , the Federal Police is asking the people for help .
on Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 pm , the woman crossed the railway platform at the end of the platform at the end of the platform and was recorded by a freight train coming from M√∂n@@ ch@@ eng@@ lad@@ bach .
according to the Federal Police , she suffered severe injuries by collecting the train .
on the spot , it was treated emergency medical treatment and was brought to a hospital by rescue teams .
on the grounds of the ni@@ gh@@ tly cross @-@ crossing of the young woman there are no knowledge of the intermedi@@ ary officials .
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
In@@ quiry comes from local residents or pedestri@@ ans of Lin@@ der@@ ner railway , brick bak@@ ers , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther road ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) .

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute on TT@@ IP
the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system to increase the dispute over the TT@@ IP Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership .
the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its functioning fulfil@@ s considerably more traditional courts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ str√∂m in the performance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Swe@@ de is propos@@ ing to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TT@@ IP is to create the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings clearly demonstrate that the EU states and the US choose independent judges for a new investment court . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they should come from the same parts of the EU , the US and third countries .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens did not trust the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Malm@@ str√∂m . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the long term , they want to work towards an International Investment Court .
there may , for example , also resolve disputes between Chinese companies and EU states .
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , which is especially demanded by large corporations , is considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TT@@ IP .
the traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel @-@ law in which companies can dispute the tax pay@@ ers , le@@ verage national laws or to en@@ force a reduction of consumer and environmental standards .
in the first statements , anti @-@ TT@@ IP organizations such as Camp@@ act rejected the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate .
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
the German state secretary of affairs Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand , described the plans as a great advance .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Commission considered essential points in the reform that Federal Minister of Economics , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU Trade Ministers in the spring . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ str√∂m .
the European business association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against limiting the action of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged because of this .
when the negotiations on the TT@@ IP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains uncle@@ ar on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
however , the subject of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already stand at the end of this year . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer valid .
delicate Folk of S@@ uf@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago S@@ uf@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him there is a fli@@ p@@ chart showing the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ated folk singer filmed the picturesque US state of Mich@@ igan with felt @-@ tip pen .
the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture .
he tells from different places he always records on the map , what his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ously and delicate arranged songs tell .
where they arose and how it looks there , in his homeland .
since then St@@ ev@@ ens proves to be a wonderfully creative artist .

rum@@ or is that &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 US states should be discussed in a row .
but already in 2004 and in the near of the Rhine , &quot; Seven S@@ wan &quot; has already appeared and has a positive effect on certain expectations .

Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionnaire
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut is expected to be eag@@ erly awa@@ ited at the prime minister &apos;s round .
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is to give his debut at the prime minister &apos;s round of questions and join David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to face the first of his six questions , shortly after noon , whereby his performance is likely to be tested by the media and the Labour MPs from nearby .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip a few sessions to leave her colleagues .
the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C conference on Tuesday .
meanwhile , during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence during a commem@@ oration ceremony marking the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , the Labour leader &apos;s decision prov@@ oked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs in the newspapers .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Mr Cor@@ by@@ n spokesperson said he had &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night programme that he advised Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be aboli@@ shed .
almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they rely on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than one sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party had originally supported him as a leader .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the political correspon@@ dent of BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; within Labour as well as Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of profits . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference that Labour had to make changes to remove the whole idea of a total limitation .
hours later Mr Smith , the Shadow working and pensions minister , said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of ¬£ 26.@@ 000 to ¬£ 23.@@ 000 .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron , since he joined T@@ ory , over the Dis@@ patch Box during the last decade .
the Labour leader , who has promised another approach , says he has &quot; crow@@ de @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions .
the Is@@ lington North MP said that the prime minister &apos;s questions are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he will refra@@ in from both &quot; skill &quot; and the dispute with bar@@ bs , and instead decided to focus on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and the challenges for young people .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the Shadow Economic minister will represent him if he does not participate - for example if Mr Cameron is on his way abroad .
he also brought the idea that other colleagues sometimes take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the lower house , to discuss the problem .
when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Jud@@ y &apos;s Theater , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s questions . but a few years later he admitted that he had failed in it .
since it was first broad@@ cast@@ ed on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed by the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his leadership in the House of Comm@@ ons and his position under his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it had become a car@@ ic@@ ature and needed far @-@ reaching reforms .

pounds increase by accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
the Po@@ und went br@@ is@@ k@@ ly according to data indicating a rise in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ BM@@ iller &apos;s bid target .
between May and July , the result grew without bonuses in the United Kingdom by 2.@@ 9 % compared with the same period of the previous year .
this percentage has been the quick@@ est and quick@@ est estimates since 2009 at the time of an increase in interest rates .
the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to ‚Ç¨ 1.@@ 37@@ 30 .
the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the tak@@ eover offer of the rival AB In@@ be@@ v was received .
one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring together brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch .
Bur@@ berry Shar@@ es were up to 0.@@ 9 % higher after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont .
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - again reports growth .
shares of Gl@@ en@@ core increased 5 % after the Mining Industry said that it took 2.5 billion $ by stock sales as part of its strategy of lowering debt .
the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a drop of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his assessment for the company rating on &quot; sell . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % after the sports clothing company reported pre @-@ tax profit of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year .
J@@ D Sports CEO says that higher wages thre@@ aten expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says .
the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs .

and the Generation U@@ 17 revol@@ ves around .
like Vik@@ tori@@ a Rud@@ in@@ ska .
the 15 year old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied Jus@@ tin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates in front of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ damer Platz .
the Bi@@ eber @-@ Building : here you are living I@@ dol , whose posters hang in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening .
the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as her mo@@ m E@@ wa mer@@ its for half a year .
if at all .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she says : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; actually , my Wik@@ tori@@ a should have to sit in the tenth class in the gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am fulfilling her a dream . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
compulsory education ?
who are you looking for ?
the fans don &apos;t .
also Bi@@ eber itself is not .
he has taken care of that anyway .
for advertising in the advertising break of the super @-@ collector , he made three million dollars , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company donated many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account .
and every doll , which looks like it and goes over the counter , also collects Bi@@ eber .
when Jus@@ tin Bi@@ eber dr@@ ink@@ eth a coffee , you are amazed at the window .
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
others stress Bi@@ eber is finally in the US and UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 .
Bi@@ eber itself , whose fourth album is to be followed in November , doesn &apos;t interest the many n@@ ul@@ ls first .
at least he does so .
Pe@@ gi@@ da Poster brings Leb@@ esen to a potato @-@ twe@@ eter idea
potatoes or D@@ √∂ner ?
it is both - in the potato dum@@ b developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ase owner , Han@@ i Al@@ hay .
inspired by the saying &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potatoes and meat were put together on a sk@@ ewer .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ √∂ner &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on television . &quot; &quot; &quot;
since then , a barbecue grill is spinning in its store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes .
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay .
the idea of the Leban@@ ese has meanwhile been registered at the Patent Office in Munich .
according to the authority , it has recently been protected as utility models .
that is why Al@@ hay is therefore not willing to betra@@ y how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer does .
&quot; &quot; &quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the culinary international understanding also works well with his customers .
Met@@ Cash launches sustainability campaign to fight aging al@@ di@@ - collapse
Met@@ cash is trying to protect the I@@ GA branches from an Al@@ di advance in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of the I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a $ 700 million Al@@ di invasion .
while Al@@ di prepares the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia at the beginning of next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets rein@@ force their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing through social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de Show .
Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as ice manufacturer S@@ immo from Dun@@ s@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheap tickets for the South Australian soccer league to loyal customers .
it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment is carrying out its annual investors strategic day .
there is a lot going on in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia make up almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA &apos;s shops and generate higher profit margins than Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states .
purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in Eastern states .
however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di would cut around five percent of the food market in these two countries twelve months after the opening of its first markets and take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers .
according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and cash 250 million by the end of 2016 .
this forecast is based on the assumption that in the next year Al@@ di opened 25 stores in SA and 30 in WA and will generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million $ earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said .
at the same time , Met@@ ering loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal .
Morgan Stan@@ ley claims that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s sales in the food and food business will fall by 3.8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , talked to a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash is likely to disappear within a decade .
cash refused to react to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass publicly .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr. Dou@@ glass last week .
since 2010 IG@@ S market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trading , which has supplied about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction of operating debt to sales and margins at the same time .
however , the wholes@@ al@@ ers we@@ ars and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to increase sales prices with col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to improve I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods and providing a better choice of private label foods .
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refur@@ bish@@ ment programs will grow to El@@ an hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in the year 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise as criticism for his behaviour .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios . according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly deserves praise as criticism for his own behavior .
Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is always called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ ight by the not@@ orious struggle of Cy@@ cla@@ des with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters .
in a fier@@ y qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ry@@ an Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison called : &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have beaten Cy@@ gios , and I should sm@@ ash the child . &quot;
while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket after a Kra@@ mp@@ f eng@@ ul@@ fed Richard Gas@@ quet &apos;s potential US Open @-@ victory , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly .
the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ final against Great Britain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one thing I &apos;m looking for is the fact that in my view Th@@ an@@ asi was dra@@ fted a little into the fight , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost to the US Open because of a cra@@ mp but he is not the first player to break a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it .
but really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much appreciation .
he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he has been treated a little too severely .
he is a very mature 19 @-@ year old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own mer@@ its .
He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take Kyr@@ gy@@ back in the important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term fixed component into the team . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we wish that the team is completely focused on competition and not on all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Cy@@ gios &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Nick made a very quick rise to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray have pointed out . he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the li@@ mel@@ ight , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate and it is best for the team and it is the best for him .
Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency , closes the border , keeps refugees back
Hungary declared the emergency stand and rated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to come illeg@@ ally into the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acting in a land of Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted Ser@@ b officials with indign@@ ation .
the people who fled before violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there .
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; &quot; &quot; when a police helicopter was ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police force . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some rejected food and water from protest .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister explained it was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to return migrants from Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot; &quot; &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; discussions with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border ended a day after the 28 @-@ Nations @-@ bloc with a disputed meeting in Brussels could not agree on a common immigration policy .
however , the Ministers agreed to share responsibility for 4@@ 0,000 people who sought refuge in the un@@ awar@@ es of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that after the next month or by the end of the year , an agreement would be made that the EU states would take up another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary .
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
Hungary , however , did not place his hopes for a prompt action from Brussels or his neighbors .
the emergency stand deployed on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block streets and accelerate asylum procedures .
Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan the construction of a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border with Romania to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after having finished a fence on the Serbian border .
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were used to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
in recent months Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck and the entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insist@@ ed that most emerging economic refugees are those looking for a better life , and not war refugees who have the right to protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the new laws that came into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia led to a crime . these laws also set higher prison terms for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares state of emergency , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs repor@@ ters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week , but Associ@@ ated Press reports have already seen heavily armed soldiers on the border with vehicles and dogs for days .
Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities had 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country .
they come over by damaging the fence ; they are now in police custody and are accused of being committed to the new laws .
authorities are here to fix the fence quickly .
Hungarian officials closed on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train wag@@ gon arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
chaos converted the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process people &apos;s data and press a crowd to push their way there .
some 20 failed to enter but thousands remained outside .
another group of migrants blocked the most important highway connection from Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they enter Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton is still holding a double @-@ digit margin in the democratic race around the nom@@ ination at national level , but Sen@@ ator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders won her face to the ground .
Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( 17 percent increase ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; vice @-@ President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is ed@@ ging for the Pres@@ idency of the Pres@@ idency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more than five months before the start of the election , most democratic voters say it is too early to say their opinion is about which candidate they will support .
but Clin@@ tons supporters are more consistent in their election than that of the other candidates .
since the C@@ BS News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some profits .
Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have dimin@@ ished .
their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is only 5 points behind .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters less than 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage with the older voters . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group .
about half of the demo@@ crati@@ cally elected voters of the prim@@ aries state that they would support Clinton when she was nominated by the party .
one neighborhood would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more strongly mixed with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter will support them enthusias@@ tically .
while 48 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) .
if Clin@@ tons supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) .
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mention their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the eligi@@ bility are also quoted .
as the Vice President th@@ rows a potential for the Pres@@ idential Committee into the Wa@@ ag@@ shell , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the prim@@ aries want to see him in the race - although one third believes that he should not do so .
if democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are asked who is their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top .
more than half of Clin@@ tons supporters say that Bi@@ den &apos;s second choice would be far from S@@ anders .
if Bi@@ den decides not to can@@ did@@ de for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead against S@@ anders will increase , from 20 points with bi@@ den in race to 30 points without him in the race .
fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances of winning the election ; however , this figure has fallen from 78 percent last month .
&quot; &quot; &quot; bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cho@@ ke &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
nevertheless , on the question of what is more important with a candidate , Democ@@ rat voters call questions about the elec@@ torate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; similar to the last month , no single Democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the prim@@ aries stands out as unacceptable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Democratic candidates or potential candidates deliver good results in some important features among voters of the prim@@ aries of their party . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities .
Bi@@ den is best trimm@@ ed by hon@@ esty with the three candidates while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead .
thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him .
in general , democratic voters of the pres@@ election also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in line with their views .
with all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders .
as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server are still being asked as foreign minister during the term of office , most demo@@ cra@@ cies are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not affected their opinions altogether .
but it is a different story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied .
public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light .
most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion has deterior@@ ated .
they are mainly Republi@@ cans , more than six out of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse .
although Clinton is regarded by the voters of their party as honest and trust@@ worthy , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May .
62 % of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
at the same time , 55 percent of eligible voters see Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy .
Clinton and Tr@@ ump however receive good guidance on leadership .
of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush hon@@ estly cut off with hon@@ esty .
a majority regards S@@ anders rather than hon@@ estly , but as with Car@@ son , many don &apos;t think of him .
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the early elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to the nationwide survey behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son ranks close to Donald Tr@@ ump in the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
in the meantime , half of the support of the voters in the new pol@@ l is eliminated , and others lose their support dramatically .
Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers nationwide . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son flow@@ ed from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and has sur@@ passed Tr@@ ump to Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ur Scott Walker , who fell at the lowest , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % .
former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ ab@@ ee and Florida Sen@@ ator Marco Ru@@ bio are at 6 % in third place .
the fault mar@@ row at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey released last week shows that Car@@ son enters the poll@@ s - with 19 % support from the Republi@@ cans , behind the dump with 32 % support .
the latest survey by ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump well ahead of Car@@ son .
looking at a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tr@@ ump found some si@@ eves for the ex @-@ neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed for ques@@ tioning Tr@@ um@@ ps &apos;s faith .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mr@@ s Tr@@ ump on Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot; &quot; &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is up to 29 degrees warm .
even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water .
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) .
bathing temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it can even climb up to 29 degrees .
in the Adriatic there are 25 degrees in the top , in France 23 degrees .
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood bur@@ dened with the death of Bar@@ uch College @-@ new@@ bie
almost two years after a student died during an intri@@ gu@@ ing ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five persons will be submitted .
members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g brut@@ ally during an initi@@ ation ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , leading to his death .
officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 pound back@@ pack loaded with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to approach a frozen section to a target .
Mr. Den@@ g eventually compl@@ ained about headache , then he fell unconscious .
the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital , thus the police .
however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , to goo@@ gling his symptoms , and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to get advice , said Police Offic@@ ers Chris Wagner at a press conference .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at this point , members began to hide utensils and basically put the welfare of the Brotherhood through Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Police Offic@@ ers Wagner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning on his injuries .
after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g has repeatedly been inflic@@ ted on the head , tor@@ so and th@@ ig@@ h with a bl@@ unt force .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many families have been destroyed by the sham@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died at the ch@@ ic@@ anes every year since 1970 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
bro@@ ther@@ hoods and their members must be held accoun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important .
a Mon@@ roe County Grand Jury suggested an indictment for murder of the third count for the first five members .
thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of criminal attacks and formation of a criminal union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them accoun@@ table , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood and the national bro@@ therhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation with the local group .
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
a rise in interest is coming , and the domestic trip will be shaken , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession .
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
in particular , the history of the economy provides only little guidance on the process .
a recession came in only 11 months after the first increase in the rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve on raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather on the period required for norm@@ alisation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in fact , several variables play a role .
in the end , market participants could , however , find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a rise in interest .
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the &apos; cheap money &apos; era , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers .
in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to the sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear .
however , this does not mean that there will be no impact .
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can make things volati@@ le for a while .
as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is apparently a tendency that asset earnings are stran@@ gled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a more recent study on what is happening after the F@@ ed &apos;s interest rate increases . &quot; &quot; &quot;
more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to the rise in interest , rather flat in the 250 days after that ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis , published by Bob D@@ oll , CEO of Plant Strate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s .
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares tend to occur later in the raising cycle and the return on the share begins to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often encourage them .
in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and that could accelerate a recession .
extremely not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at an increase in interest of the F@@ ed .
according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 were only twice nominal GDP below 4.5 percent .
although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent in 2015 , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if it is different this time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot; &quot; &quot;
market participants agreed to raise interest for interest all year , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday .
while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trading gives only a probability of 25 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ing heights were put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase .
the current cycle is by far the longest one that the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far .
the fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates a rise in interest rates , and the pattern is pretty much the same as on the capital market .
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is quicker than in shares if they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
at the end of the raising cycle , the loans on loan immediately fall , said Deutsche Bank .
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the rise in interest rates will cause yields between longer and shorter bonds to come closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
high interest bonds often result in better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fix@@ ed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis .
what is interesting is Jones , that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the drop in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , len@@ ders have expanded and volati@@ lity has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed is tigh@@ tening its strategy .
businesses that handle the larger part of their business in the United States will benefit from this when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive .
multinational corporations with high debts are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; shares tend to react very positively three months after an initial interest rate rise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have exceeded the average by 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 .
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their equivalent in terms of lower quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will be a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , &quot; says Gold@@ man .
outside the pure stock of shares , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar .
savers can see profits through higher income , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly this will take place .
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Parliament conserv@@ atives critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damp@@ ening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that it is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; &quot; &quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; programme and said that this was not very original . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; converts &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; into Classic FM , claims a leading member of Parliament and raises new pressure on the channel to prove that he does something that private transm@@ it@@ ters do not . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ing@@ ham also said the BBC boss that the public radio station &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and increasingly will no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December .
the BBC Music Awards , which launched last year , seem to be just a different name for The Br@@ its .
so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous named examples where you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ing@@ ham said .
BBC general director rejected the alleg@@ ations and argued that BBC Radio 3 is far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and education .
what I learn from Radio 3 , I &apos;m not going to learn anything else about classical music .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is truly un@@ sur@@ passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commissioned new works is really important , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller argued Alan Dav@@ ey that hard work must be made to engage the public when it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music .
however , radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sports came under fire to tramp@@ le commercial ri@@ vals on the feet .
T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Coll@@ ins picked up The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by the Dutch producer T@@ alp@@ a Media for an estimated cost of ¬£ 22 million .
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insist@@ ed that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - was produced in a special BBC fashion .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he added , he wanted the company to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; if the next time it star@@ ed into an entertainment series . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , he refused to issue orders from other series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from the fees for other entertainment formats .
net sales rose by slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales .
in the last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday in November slow@@ ed down the issues
for over a decade , the virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming , and many of Great Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into gh@@ ost towns .
however , experts say that there is now evidence that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of records in 2000 with just five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if you consider growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , this has always been evolving over time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he explained that online sales increased three years ago when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phone purchases .
it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa .
but now this is up and we may experience that growth is less@@ ening .
the Black Friday phenomenon , imported from America , is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
experts believe that buyers can keep their purchases from this event , which takes place on the last Friday in November .
last year , five times the average number of buyers reflected their computers to make their bar@@ gains and some dealer sites crashed .
experts believe that Black Friday , in which buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium discovered that ¬£ 5 was spending a little more than ¬£ 1 online .
for some products , such as TVs and washing machines , more than one third of purchases are now carried out via web shops .
at the same time more than a quarter of people buy clothes and shoes online instead of in the fashion chains in the inner cities .
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca in the crane accident killed - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims at the first funeral in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partly lays down the collapse of the huge Saudi Ben Laden group
the Ministry of Health said that in addition 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims were gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the dead that were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mos@@ que .
ber@@ eav@@ ed , dressed mostly in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery .
the funeral procession passed on to the holy place , where only days before a building crane rus@@ hed through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the bed@@ side .
the bodies were released for the funeral when the Saudi King hung a sanc@@ tion over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family because of the disaster , which also left 3@@ 94 wounded .
the bodies of 29 operators who were killed when a crane crashed through the big central mo@@ ch@@ ee of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane was under@@ scor@@ ing .
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
Saudi officials have already announced that the H@@ add@@ sch will continue to go to Mec@@ ca with thousands who will continue to visit the city .
today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden Group , said , should not have allowed the arm of the crane to stop when he was not used .
an Arab version of the decree published by the State Saudi Press Agency said the bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse .
the English @-@ language service provided by the news agency did not tell this detail , but said that the management of the company should be banned from abroad .
at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane that crashed into a courtyard of the big mos@@ que where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which will take place later this month .
the Bin Laden Group issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement .
the Royal Dec@@ ree also imp@@ acted the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mec@@ ca &apos;s mega @-@ fairy as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the family of Saudi Arabia for decades and takes over major construction projects .
the de@@ ceased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was an apost@@ ate son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 &quot; s .
the fall of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the Pil@@ gri@@ mage , which is required at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims .
officials said 158 people stay in hospital .
government officials ordered that 1 Million Ri@@ al ( ¬£ 17@@ 4,000 ) to pay to the families of the killed and the same amount of permanent injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Bos@@ s says that the time of cheap East European craftsmen is over
British employ increasingly tra@@ des@@ people , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry
the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe has sur@@ passed
this leads to the opening of 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen .
at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her will close 60 B &amp; Q sales outlets nationwide
by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail
it is claimed that Br@@ its will lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of qualified eastern European craftsmen who carry out their work in their homes .
if you can skil@@ fully handle walls with a hammer or a brush , you seem to be a minority today .
because British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ men to perform DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company behind B &amp; Q .
V√©@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the construction markets chain said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices , is now out@@ dated .
therefore King@@ fis@@ her plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that are aimed at craftsmen and close 60 points of sales of B &amp; Q .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women .
at the moment the men out@@ weigh the men .
she said that it is necessary to address the growing demographic trends that have more female single households who do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to shift this stronger to a balance .
basically , half of our clients consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women .
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in leadership positions .
King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied exactly 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer .
Mr@@ s Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ Fis@@ her reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the Group deb@@ ated the cost of closing the stores .
because of the trend , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches .
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob on account of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian Volleyball Vice Champion A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion .
the def@@ end@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of authority .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was adj@@ our@@ ned .
according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , in the preliminary investigation , the def@@ end@@ ants had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the years 2006 to 2011 , funds from the association accounts , about which they were allowed to disp@@ ose of their functions , for private purposes .
he will be responsible for the damage with around 400@@ ,000 euros .
the sports officials are also accused of treas@@ on .
this fact was distinguished by the Chairman of the Sch@@ √∂ff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in .
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
the Defence argued that at no time an asset had been created for the association .
the sports officials only counted allow@@ ances and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money - the Pas@@ si@@ va amounted to roughly 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time we stood before the situation : do we continue or block the club ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the accused , in the B@@ read profession of the finance office . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with his co @-@ accused and co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have up@@ shot money , put our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debts .
in the event of a corresponding financial success , the withdrawal of the compens@@ atory damages had been decided retro@@ actively until 1991 .
therefore , one part of the allow@@ ance was paid only years later , namely , from 2003 , when a plus was deposited in the account .
therefore , package and non @-@ detail deviations also appeared , the former chairman explained the operations .
the accounts and austerity books jointly administered the two def@@ end@@ ants , said the second def@@ end@@ ant .
why the withdrawal of the association was not disclosed in detail , asked the judge .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the association was not interested in the details of the financial statements , it was important only the freedom of debt had been , so the answer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when the official investigations were started in 2011 due to official abuse , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account .
these were appropri@@ ations , the def@@ end@@ ants asser@@ ted .
this securities account ran to the name of the second def@@ end@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not disclosed to the association .
&quot; why ? &quot; the judge wanted to know .
the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ator didn &apos;t know the answer for a long time .
then he finally said that he believed that this was the best for the club .
if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor set in the room .
the co @-@ accused was informed , the function@@ ary justified himself .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; claims for damage &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
why claim compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know .
on top of that , the first def@@ end@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association had never been damaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; With this you are all of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the function@@ ary said moreover , he never paid a cent salary , he merely calcul@@ ates mil@@ eage and di@@ ets .
at di@@ ets he charged the association 1000 euros per month , but the actual effort was much higher , he added .
exact documents for the early years could not prove the def@@ end@@ ants .
these were no longer kept , according to an operational test in which everything was judged correctly , they declared .
mil@@ eage was also related to the second def@@ end@@ ant .
all the exercises were made in cash , with which he had to leave the international market to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence , he explained in his statement .
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the inter@@ ro@@ gation of witnesses .
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard presents more than 30,000 jobs
in addition to the personnel mining that has been running for three years , the computer giant will disman@@ tle other jobs during the company &apos;s spl@@ itting .
the positions at the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) computer giant have no end .
as part of its restructuring , the U.S. technology company plans to reduce the mining of 25,000 to 30,000 positions in its corporate customer division .
as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) should be saved , the company announced on Tuesday .
the step will lead to a special load of around $ 2.7 billion , which will drop in the fourth quarter .
the mining of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not been completed for three years .
at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed around 30@@ 2,000 employees .
the Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share yiel@@ ded 2.3 percent .
the company , which grew up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , currently divi@@ des itself on : the computer and printer business is to be bund@@ led even faster in a new society , separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies as well as other services .
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers in accordance with its services set the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer in the form of Lenovo .
in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , the sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.@@ 5 percent .
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
thus the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP respon@@ ds with a spl@@ itting and massive sub@@ missions to change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man recently re@@ acted that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more business online .
in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of around 55@@ ,000 jobs .
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would mostly result in rejection : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 percent agreed .
while other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent will be positive .
24 percent are opposed to intervene in the conflict .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a collaboration with Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad is 51 percent of those surv@@ eyed , 20 percent would be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .

the focus of the fair will be on until 27 September connected , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility .
after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Conn@@ ected mobility &quot; on Thursday .
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
the organizers of the V@@ DA Auto Association look like two years ago with about 900 000 visitors .
R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke : break @-@ out of violence in Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police used the Serbian border near R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ √§n@@ stre@@ as and the water @-@ thro@@ wer against several hundred displaced persons .
the Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent D@@ √°@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the breach of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees crossed the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen was a water @-@ thro@@ wer ready .
40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials .
the officials initially dis@@ continued pepper spray .
after that , the police used tear gas .
much tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now declined slightly .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
also the press spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
the world ob@@ serves when the US central bank comes together on two days , Wednesday and Thursday , to make the most important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not .
a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of view was that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist for a little longer and that interest rates remain at the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent .
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest has risen to NU@@ LL .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the US economy is on a relatively good level of power , tril@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation .
however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global relations .
it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good .
the decision should be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death Pat@@ tern at the Delta State University left dis@@ ap@@ pointing comments
after shooting and killing his girl@@ friend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was sorry for the first murder and wanted &quot; he could undo it , &quot; announced the authorities on Tuesday .
the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , lecturer of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; He shot and killed someone . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lamb tells the staff of the emergency center that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is in the house but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police asked the c@@ aller for his name , but he did not give him .
Lamb didn &apos;t give any explanation for his shots .
when police entered the scene they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I wanted , I could reverse it .
I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
after writing the note , Lamb drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen were ring@@ ing him .
&quot; &quot; &quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ b &apos;s performance . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb thought that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; triangle relationship &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married for about seven years as a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; good person &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; destroyed by the ground . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online at home , according to L@@ ins@@ man Know@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss by the Sun Her@@ ald .
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; Know@@ les said
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police said that Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to jail . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later that night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled to foot , ran into the woods and killed himself with a shot .
Lamb received a doc@@ torate from the Delta State University in spring 2015 , like his li@@ fest@@ y@@ les on the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa establishes the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros per year alone with a better organization .
150 of the roughly 1000 executives around the world will cost the conversion of the Group to the workplace .
but with the pilot union there are new negotiations .
the Lufthansa establishes its corporate structure and upgrades the low @-@ priced Euro@@ wings .
the aim of the real@@ ignment is a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year from cost and earnings syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday .
among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the board for the passenger business in the future .
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as independently as possible .
in the management team headed by chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r , Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings .
with the new order Sp@@ oh@@ r emphas@@ ises the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future .
to date , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been a complex undertaking .
the airlines operated under the heading of the Passage Airline Group , which represents three @-@ quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros .
new negotiations with the pilots
in the conflict with the pilot association cockpit ( VC ) the negotiations are to be res@@ um@@ ed after the formally stopped strike on this Thursday .
that divided the union with .
the theme of the talks will be the retirement provision for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; cockpit wants to achieve profitable results &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as quickly as possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the conflict between union and airline resulted in several strikes in recent months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition to the interim supply of the drivers , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wings &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; austerity concept is in the background . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is clear that the Lufthansa is out@@ lining routes to the company &apos;s own cheap airline Euro@@ wings in the fight against competitors .

Manchester United can &apos;t play for months because of double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ hoven .
while this brought the left external def@@ enders to we@@ ep and exclude him from playing for at least six months , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w will be able to play again this season .
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated to the field for nine minutes and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mr Van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and lies in the hospital . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps one day later and then operated in Manchester .
it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then that happens .
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase .
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a red card and the im@@ position of an El@@ f@@ meter .
Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans .
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an el@@ m and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
a tweet on Sha@@ ws &apos;s account : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery now starts , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffered the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in PS@@ V &apos;s defeat
the UK distributor has an additional incentive for the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
when a player with this type of injury leaves the place , all are very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break@@ age when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland &apos;s team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is very hard , because it wasn &apos;t his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear that it is a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I feel very bad doing it . I &apos;m so sorry .

surely David Cameron does know The Lor@@ ax better ?
it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it by heart .
unless you are David Cameron .
when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental label issued in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss .
it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the Super@@ Camp@@ s website and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children because it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead re@@ prints an abstra@@ ction of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text .
&quot; amid the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the girl of his dreams , &quot; he reads . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Gei@@ sel was and who died in 1991 , however completely unknown .
as if that were not yet susp@@ icious : the text presented by Cameron reads partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy hears how the local environment is ra@@ v@@ aged by the gre@@ edy , tree @-@ prone , th@@ need @-@ kn@@ itting On@@ ce @-@ ler , despite the protests of the nam@@ ens@@ ing Lor@@ ax , a ro@@ cking , fier@@ y character , &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times consec@@ u@@ tively to a child .
a Dow@@ ning Street speaker said that the text had probably come from Cameron &apos;s electoral college .
Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Camer@@ ons &apos; employees , but gave no immediate comments .
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exp@@ ul@@ sion from England &apos;s crew , but it is still difficult
encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card .
I would not exclude a down@@ turn .
A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear sc@@ ars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude .
with the ball Mo@@ een Ali developed as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown dimension at test level , is an option for the attack .
this related message : Adam Ly@@ th resig@@ ns from the England @-@ test @-@ cad@@ re and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire .
during his seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that the ti@@ cket@@ eers are focused on results .
there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination as - and I said this before - players are their own best selection .
long ago , the run of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate .
if he hopefully turns out more of Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes .
the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ li@@ ss commen@@ ded his attitude , even though he did not perform such good performances , and that was not surprising ; he is primarily a team man .
the question of how much time a test man gets to set his character is difficult .
Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
the only accus@@ ation that could be raised was that England first deployed Jonathan Des@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer I shoot up high .
he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which really met us .
he must have at least the same chances as before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates .
the idea of letting Mo@@ een cook next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin bow@@ ler and would receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared and I did not mind anything about it .
I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players .
Mo@@ een might not have done his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for her , and there is no big difference .
my former team @-@ mate Jus@@ tin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests on the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
he made three hundred calls straight away and did not look back .
Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes up in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited handling with him he impressed me as a young man .
people may see their stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a p@@ unt , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers opted for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
apart from the crew , England has made some smart additions to the training station .
the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup .
he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks .
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment to the setup .
I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit .
sometimes new voices can bring fresh wind in the dressing room , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before .
Coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break from Australia and I have no problem with it for my part .
some will not agree , but coaches and team players will not determine the schedule .
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not taken lightly .

in Bri@@ gh@@ ton , the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it even if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie &apos;s agenda .
Prime Minister and finance ministers climb to summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say they win allies for reforms .
it &apos;s always about me .
my European friend , looking for an outside Britain outside the EU - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets see that more and more short @-@ sigh@@ ted ministers and officials have come to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go .
Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as has happened in the exagger@@ ated long exp@@ ul@@ sions such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mitter@@ rand ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) .
France &apos;s Fran√ßois Hollande looks at his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a lef@@ tist one .
it is difficult to imagine that they are going to break up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland eman@@ cipation from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have .
therefore , some such ministers may even deliberately not plan helpful comments , completely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process is suspected of my boy@@ friend .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bank@@ rupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Europeans know how pre@@ dat@@ ory Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics are the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press one , as they were not supported by Tony Ben@@ n in 1975 , but that supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
they can remember Boris Johnson who has made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s .
in all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies .
this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing vil@@ la@@ ins , tel@@ eph@@ ones and pseu@@ do @-@ non @-@ nation@@ als most of our big newspapers .
actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought about her , but found that when one sits in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you can distribute better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of becoming his lunch and dinner .
in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir than Bla@@ ir himself , when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor to him .
the press never did it any more .
but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly flap on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me to waste - seems to be in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy , a mistake at that time and today .
it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday .
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I feel friendly - in the development .
he says we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
well , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ar@@ ouse tendency and the wild gra@@ dient of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engli@@ sh@@ ism can certainly say yes to everyone .
it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said when the boy sc@@ outs were fighting in him , did not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell as Shadow Chancellor was a bad idea .
it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father fought on television to be il@@ loyal to his Labour cabinet colleagues without going too far and losing his cabinet job .
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports at their cl@@ auses meeting on Monday evening .
whatever the touch@@ able bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - keep in mind that he even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron any free ticket for Europe allowing him to maintain Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks that way .
but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities to EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite reign economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism of small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes .
as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home .
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have susp@@ icious voters - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all this can be point@@ less ?
the US is already quite disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum on Monday .
experts critic@@ ise Public Health UK report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 persons , some with links to tobacco industry , researchers said .
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined the Lanc@@ et by critici@@ zing the evidence used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in her report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
he published the &quot; base report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an editorial in the medical journal &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Lanc@@ et last month &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; attacked the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the statements &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said the public expects that the asser@@ tion of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were sum@@ mon@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report .
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco Medium ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
he also signed the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a sustainability report , they said .
one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports before by the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International joined them .
the reasons for choosing the board members will not be delivered , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champ@@ ions , some of which also provide industry financing in the paper .
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
the meeting also took part in the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the group &apos;s research work &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; conf@@ ers evidence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; hard evidence of most products &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in most of the criteria , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , none of these links or limitations will be discussed in the P@@ he report .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes act as a way to qu@@ itting smoking for children or non @-@ smo@@ kers . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that the claims of BM@@ J have already been re@@ acted previously .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ cigar@@ ettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
all evidence suggests that health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects .
p@@ he has the un@@ ambig@@ uous obligation to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco .
almost 8@@ 0,000 people die every year with a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year .
by presenting current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction .
BBC should give up East@@ ern@@ ary , says former boss of Channel 4
the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ern@@ ers and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would give &quot; their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap .
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ cast@@ ers .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ j@@ uri@@ di@@ cal programs that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience to place in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and by transm@@ it@@ ters like BB@@ C4 .
after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also be clearly shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the Ober@@ haus Communication Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if you want to keep the broadcasting fee , which I don &apos;t think in the medium or long term for a good idea , you should at least give your production on programs that others do not do or commissioned .
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve the wid@@ est possible support for their future .
the idea that nobody else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s non@@ sense , of course .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax funding is financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Voice is such a program , East@@ ern@@ er is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both self @-@ productions .
hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm for it .
I am trying to see how this is supposed to be public @-@ righteous television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
Johnson , an entrepren@@ eur for series running Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 said that the BBC is to blame on the hunt for reviews &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people working there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts are what the former leader of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ ern@@ ers should sell .
Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they go to their apparent mission to justify $ 4 billion radio fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has ever seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the broadcasting fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
of course you all think that one gets a great value here for ¬£ 150 per year , but for people who are ¬£ 150 a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they do not consume much of the BBC .
former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should review their char@@ itable mission , &quot; educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
he said that only little of BBC Production is now officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to inform , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain the public television stations in Australia and Canada . &quot;
to the question of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas such as those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television will be shown , and with commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers enter alli@@ ances to make everything available online .
&apos;@@ probe Genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems , which can be controlled by erup@@ tions of sound waves .
the tiny n@@ em@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment when they are be@@ amed with sound im@@ pul@@ s that have high frequencies for the human ear to be heard .
the pulses work by switching on motor neur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the di@@ aphrag@@ m channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves .
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics where ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body .
Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electric impulses to the brain of people for the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease .
thread worms are usually not responding to ultrasound , but Chal@@ azi@@ ani discovered that they did when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles .
the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms .
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms .
the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications .
in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , it genetically modified the worms so that some of their motor neur@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels .
when he applies ultrasound to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transmitted to the worms where they turn on the changed motor neur@@ ons .
the method has some simil@@ arities with op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light .
but Hal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired place in the brain on an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to temporarily disable the targeted human neur@@ ons in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot; &quot; &quot;
other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added .

but a separate campaign also leads to many posters that are to be seen at bus stops and subway trains and which require a second look .
&quot; important announcement : drive from 15 to 18 September with DL@@ R ? &quot; ( D@@ ock@@ lands Light Railway ) you can read in the font types of the London Under@@ ground and the hall@@ mark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into the image of a tank .
in September a s@@ warm of weapons dealers will travel with the DL@@ R ... customers are asked to help stop the arms trade fair .
the 300 posters are featured by artists who have exhibited their work at the Museum f√ºr Cru@@ el Designs in Bank@@ sys Dis@@ mal@@ and .
a collective with the name Special Pat@@ rol Group helped in the distribution in London and used &quot; Ad Space H@@ ack P@@ acks , &quot; a 6 @-@ pack of in@@ bus@@ ses claiming that &quot; access to around one @-@ third of the bus stops advertising space on the planet . &quot;

one of the par@@ ody ads produced by Special Pat@@ rol Group .
after Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries .
many artists participate in the work with activists in protest movements and notice that they have to go outside to the real world so that their art has an influence on society .
another of the anti @-@ arms trade posters will greet the commuters in the underground .
the Am@@ ne@@ sty video was viewed more than 100,000 times in 24 hours via Facebook and was created by the advertising agency V@@ C@@ CP , which works non @-@ profit with the graphic artist and Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ Over artist , who also works for free .
&quot; &quot; &quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that prevailed around the advertising for the arms trade fair - through a void of the Ex@@ Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate advertising , but &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by blowing with bright colours and animation it remains strong . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture devices at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ ne@@ sty .
what we need now is a progress of the British government and the guarantee that torture devices are not tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our front door .
perhaps the most creative art around the arms trade fair comes from the area within Ex@@ Ce@@ L , where exhibitors dev@@ ote fantastic eu@@ ph@@ emis@@ tic products .

eight golden rules for life in student residen@@ ces
eleven years ago I went into a student residence as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others .
most of what I &apos;ve learned can be distill@@ ed in eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residen@@ ces ranges from slightly nerve @-@ descri@@ p@@ tive to absolutely terri@@ fying .
it &apos;s temp@@ ting to sh@@ out : people tell from where you get , whether and where you &apos;ve taken a Sabbath year , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - Ask questions and show interest .
it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those you would not talk to , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ish@@ ers were .
let people leave .
the rooms of people often turn into drinks reception , film night event venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress up and put on their under@@ wear .
related to this : do not think about starting the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
your room should be a refuge but many student residen@@ ces form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ per culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship .
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I used to interact with you . &quot;
try to feel when a fellow is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
apro@@ pos than@@ king : do it .
a guy in my student residen@@ ces had the idea that a locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship by baking .
as you begin the university at the high point of the back @-@ man@@ ie , the kno@@ cking at the doors of people is less odd than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
your ro@@ om@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and eventually will associate your face with a tasty surprise .
of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
poor@@ ly mixed lum@@ ps made from flour , sugar and fat cause people to fall asleep when they kno@@ ck .
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residen@@ ces .
of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ?
check this with the milk owner .
the chances are good that they say to operate themselves even when they cook in the interior .
if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my ro@@ omm@@ ate who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves .
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people sitting in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
a girl on my floor asked her neighbors as to whether to make it a bit more quiet for them , because three o &apos;clock in the morning , and they had a test in the morning .
they responded with even more loud music .
when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock they kindly allowed their neighbors to sleep two hours before they left their own music , closed their door and went to their three hour test .
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would happen to enter the same student residence acci@@ dentally ?
on the other hand , it would not be quite embarrass@@ ing if you hold a ro@@ omm@@ ate for your future spouse , ran@@ som them , separate themselves and then see them every day and perhaps experience how they bring together all common friends to themselves ?
of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot ro@@ omm@@ ate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to talk to your under@@ body a little reason .
in the exciting moment you notice that someone has left his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between an ultra and bul@@ lying is more fine than it seems .
a good st@@ reich is funny , but it only takes moments before it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang .
spare a valuable and am@@ using lesson through hiding - but never lose someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but t@@ ack your pos@@ sessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single @-@ drawing , low @-@ service providers
the real estate entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner relies on town@@ houses for people who do not have much money in the Fran@@ con@@ ian corner valley .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the servant @-@ servant . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I show how to build still cheap and well today , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 44 year old in an interview . &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : he builds in a project row houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ bert , many refugees will push for the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
in view of the flood of refugees , we need sufficient living space in the coming decades .
a quite tri@@ vial , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a terra@@ ced house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if one puts people in blocks of living .
each of the six houses built in the pilot project consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers each .
each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room .
it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back .
the houses can then be converted easily according to the respective needs .
how high are the costs ?
Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euros , without property .
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have correctly drawn up my project .
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending D@@ amo@@ cles special construction and the pitch regulation .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
it is still subject , who in a terra@@ ced house creates three apartments , needs at least three pitches .
only in the cities there is space .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers don &apos;t have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced project ?
Gil@@ bert : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seek@@ ers .
which is definitely not true .
but don &apos;t you ag@@ grav@@ ate the competition for affordable housing ?
Gil@@ dner : true is that in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments , which can hardly afford any more .
my project has the message , even ordinary people need living space .
not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the servant @-@ ear@@ ner .
I show how to build still cheap and well today .
that is what it is all about .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the chess club &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , so the membership increased to 19 players . &quot; &quot; &quot;

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation , which was accepted by the chairman Alfred Klein .
this makes it possible to record players who cannot afford the membership fee .
youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann desires that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connec@@ t@@ edness with the spa town .
district office looks for direct contact
&quot; &quot; &quot; Sal@@ udi@@ s and the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ eu@@ ft &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; have joined together under the coat of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
apart from consulting you can also take part in courses .
the Social Foundation goes down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors receive information on questions such as health insurance or health care insurance services .
for years we have been setting up our out@@ patient care service that often nursing relatives are left alone .
there are an endless number of questions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the complexity of the insurance companies is scar@@ cely understood , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the new manager J@@ utta W@@ eig@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ ino and the ambul@@ ant service &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness .
for this purpose the o@@ int@@ ment was taken into the boat .
therefore , additional offers such as fall prevention , memory training or a physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used .
the offers from the senior centre and the salon complement each other perfectly .
Sal@@ udi@@ s stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation .
&quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; Heike Rie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ udi@@ s , described .
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is seeing both business leaders particularly in demographic change .
this makes a good decentr@@ alized infrastructure indispensable in the individual city districts of Bam@@ berg in the future .
in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the initi@@ ation celebrations , comm@@ its itself to the slogan at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular social gathering . &quot;
with this , the Social Foundation is making a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well as possible in their familiar environment .
the office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 to 14 o &apos;clock , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 pm to 6 pm and on Satur@@ days from 10 am to 12 pm .

according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years .
on the other hand , he did not add intellec@@ tually .

men check for 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster : on Friday evening , around 23.@@ 45 hrs , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ m√ºn@@ ster .
one of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him .
at this time the group was at the level of the b@@ ft petrol station .
on the site of the gas station there were also three people .
one of these men now cried out to the young people and hit the face with the fist .
the victim had suffered from the nose and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
when his two friends rus@@ hed and appe@@ aled to the ra@@ cket , he first dropped from his victim .
the injured young man was brought home from his friends .
the perpet@@ r@@ ator pursued the group with a passenger car right up to the apartment and demonstr@@ atively passed it demonstr@@ atively several times .
when you didn &apos;t see the vehicle any more , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette .
there he was attacked again by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
with the help of a stroke , one counts on the face and the upper th@@ igh@@ s of the victim .
the injured one had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
until now , only a vag@@ ue daily description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was dressed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police are asking witnesses and instructions to sign up under the telephone number 0@@ 6@@ 181 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank M√ºller acqu@@ ires practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank M√ºller ( left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen .
in addition , mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , Wirtschafts@@ f√∂rder@@ in U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs appoint mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert as well .
in many places in the country there are missing doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : there , Dr. Frank M√ºller takes over the practice of Fel@@ ste@@ ausen on 1 October .
while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still in half a position to his successor in the next few months .
after a re@@ building phase , M√ºller will open the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 .
it was aff@@ ection@@ ate at first glance , when the ri@@ ms of the ri@@ ms came to know Frank M√ºller and his wife Dr Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently doing their specialist training in the Ver@@ den hospital and wants to get into practice next year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we always had in mind that the m@@ iller would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; when it was so far , I simply called it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the couple showed the idea to practice their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old M√ºller .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage , he is also able to be his own boss .
and so it was agreed that the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with practice .
however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
the two @-@ time family father , Frank M√ºller , also grew up there , followed his medical studies in Hanover in several medical practices and in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg .
he is currently active as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Physi@@ cian in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work at the DR@@ K @-@ readiness Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
from September 19 the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
while the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen operates as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Inter@@ nis@@ tin ) speci@@ alises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology .
the m@@ iller , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as a resident .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; end@@ os@@ copy comes out , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ onic tests as well as long @-@ term and intensity EK@@ Gs and need a chat room more .
in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed .
a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 Euros will be donated by the m@@ iller as part of a funding programme of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice will continue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses Sam@@ t@@ associate mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Silvia M√ºller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients come to the field of field breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 .
in A@@ sen@@ dorf , there is another GP practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank M√ºller : the pharmacy is maintained according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if there was no successor , it would have gone too .
those who visit M√ºll@@ ers &apos; consultations , inci@@ dentally also look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical staff and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms .
with their departure , an era ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf , after all the doctors practi@@ sed there for 30 years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in the beginning we only had two rooms , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ steh@@ ausen rec@@ alls . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a little sad@@ ness already felt it after a long time .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we continue to dwell in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and we will see many patients quite often , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; her husband said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; We have a 6000 square meter plot . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; so far , I have always pushed me before gardening , now that could be different . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel .
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now border controls are also being raised to our southern border , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people stand in the foreground .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is clear , however , that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; people need to know that we do not accept bound@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Slovenian border . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia is considering &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - Slovenia refuses . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia also wanted to leave arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and could possibly establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees .
the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach did not look like this .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the border with Croatia was already strongly controlled as an outside border of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as the minister pointed out , Slovenia doesn &apos;t want to make its borders for refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; every EU member must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot work , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ √∂r@@ k√∂@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried to arrive in eastern Croatia at the T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id border crossing in the night hours to avoid the registration .
the Croatian police could pick them up in the near corn fields .
according to local media , police vehicles with new refugees are constantly meeting in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik .
it is mainly Syrian and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children .
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4000 refugees , said Minister of Interior R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic .
in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would correspond with Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government in Belgrade asser@@ ted that it was the way people approach certain routes : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can neither , nor do we want to do so , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to media reports , at least in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id . in the course of the day more buses would be expected .
about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany
the passengers were traveling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border crossing the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we have heard that Hungary has done , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria .
with this , it could indeed come to a slightly further west route , already predicted by ob@@ servers of the former Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister , Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic , had previously stated that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exceptional situations in the event of a strong state of refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he did not address details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
you carry out strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently made a good testimony to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the Serbian side , there are still approximately 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence .
according to the media reports , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely blocked .
whether the remaining refugees are now going to go on to the Croatian border is still uncle@@ ar .
the Serbian interior minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic , tried to so@@ o@@ the Wednesday morning at a local sight in Hor@@ gos . he keeps the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for premature .
it would not currently deal with very high numbers of refugees .
one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country .
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already begun to distribute maps on the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still un@@ cleared min@@ e@@ fields .
on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock h@@ ack@@ ers : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
Sup@@ ra@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminals accused of having gained insight into un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 .
with the captured information , in@@ sider trading should have been made on the financial markets .
in this way , according to the investig@@ ators , a total of over $ 100 million was launched .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders will ultimately be tra@@ pped , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it says in the SE@@ C communication . &quot; &quot; &quot;

most of the def@@ end@@ ants come from Ukraine and Georgia .

ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lot of active operation around the Mannheim parade place .
the people do their worries , partly fast pac@@ ed , partly cozy .
you control the two stations of the Mannheim Convention Center at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
puls@@ ating , bo@@ unc@@ ing life with beautiful autumn sunlight and in the middle of it four large boards each with the inscription &quot; Before I die I want to .... &quot;
with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce was attentive to its 20 @-@ year anniversary and is definitely faced with mixed reactions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among people , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the head of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by as well as for questions and conversations like the volunteers .
while some p@@ asser@@ s @-@ by spontaneously acc@@ esses the chal@@ k and compl@@ ements the phrase &quot; my life affir@@ ms , &quot; &quot; stopping the war , &quot; &quot; stopping the war &quot; or &quot; not long suffering , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on .
again and again small discussions about the action take place on the ver@@ ge , about life , dealing with dying .
also Peter H@@ √ºb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; only if I realize that some@@ time the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ itas association bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , however , be understandable , after all , it is a very personal thing .
the topic of death and death is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer , although the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed much to opening people .
an assessment that Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
confronted by personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to engage in eu@@ than@@ asia .
when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid requested volunte@@ ering , she immediately reported and was part of the founding in 1995 .
Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and their relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hos@@ pi@@ ce Sankt Vincent .
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I see the life of another war@@ ts , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of the health insurance funds and donations of relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of mort@@ g@@ ages and ob@@ servers .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
the tablets described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F2 , 6 ) .
other personal wishes may also be recorded there on post@@ cards .
F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed , financial prospects for 2016 reduced
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the supply giant lowered its profit forecast for a whole year due to weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in its body@@ transport service .
the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for their holiday .
at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season .
the share amounted to more than 2.5 percent in market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of between $ 10.@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast .
analysts predicted $ 10.@@ 84 per survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set .
the lower prospect will rise in spite of the price increases , which will be 4.@@ 9 percent on average and will be effective on January 4 and , in spite of higher allow@@ ances for body@@ transport of heavy and large packages , which will be lifted from November onwards .
the company said it nonetheless expected that the result will increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online trading .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said the company will deliver &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; solid profits when considering the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the plans for vacation employment were announced a day later than that of the rival UPS , who plans to hire 9@@ 0,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , approximately the same number as last year .
in the first quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served at 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year .
earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predicted by Z@@ ack &apos;s investment research analysts .
sales rose 5 percent to ‚Ç¨ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six analysts asked analysts predicted $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
over the last few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which led sales to stagn@@ ate in its unit of express delivery .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
in the last quarter , sales in the body increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance .
the Express unit recorded higher revenues because of higher prices , while the result dropped due to higher labour costs in the cargo business .
in the market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ .
on Tuesday they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 .
on their most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an Mah@@ ag@@ oni table to decide whether it is time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade .
lo@@ oming over them at the end of the orn@@ ate , two @-@ story session hall there is a mur@@ al of the United States .
the card is a reminder that the chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a two @-@ time mandate from the Congress : maxim@@ ising US occupation and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
and this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday if the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from unprecedented incentive by the close to zero @-@ short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
although most of the data of the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il on the global financial markets could make the already pru@@ dent F@@ ed representatives fear@@ ful to rein@@ force this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of percentage point .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they observe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text not to increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which sett@@ les on itself the financial market .
about half of econom@@ ists recently questioned by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted a rise in interest this week .
the financial markets , however , expect a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator showing only a 30 % chance of an increase .
this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the rate unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the impact by promising that another increase is far away .
on Tuesday the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage figure j@@ umped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 .
the action was initiated by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief Econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group .
it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; if she does it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
other experts argued that a rise in interest would ease the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed good to increase the rate by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first little step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US .
in the spring and early summer , Y@@ ella had said that in spite of the dis@@ comforts of liber@@ als , it would be necessary that more economic progress would be needed to increase the rate .
although the job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year .
the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment .
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
and although inflation was constantly under the annual target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason is the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the economy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ d@@ son , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the financial markets around the world came together at the end of the last month , after China had depreci@@ ated its currency .
the D@@ ow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that a slow@@ down in the Chinese economy would damp@@ en global growth .
the market has recovered in this month , where the D@@ ow is now almost 10 % below the May High .
for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences influence the complex calculation of when interest should be increased .
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred within the last few weeks , they would attract the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff member of the US central bank .
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least a month to get a grip on the effects .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the US economy will be and there is almost no reliable data describing developments in China , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the health of the world economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved technically in its decision @-@ making .
but in the end , the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the influence of the Central Bank has been enormous over the past few years .
the mere hint given by the former director Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , spark@@ ed con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe .
in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect them to not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also advise other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy .
her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ vest@@ net Inc .
Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA , re@@ marked that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ reactions to financial market movements that are apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; varnis@@ hed , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advoc@@ ating an increase in interest rates , took decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower their interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; despite a limited @-@ identi@@ fiable impact on growth in the US , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a year later , the F@@ ed representatives had revers@@ ed these cuts .
the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability in the first place only during a severe crisis such as the 2008 market fall , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest rate .
the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of a rise in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed I do not believe it should ha@@ sten the time .
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
yes , Chin@@ at@@ own
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little aid for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
to prepare a warm welcome does not go without the dedication of countless volunteers .
also at Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seek@@ ers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still enjoys teaching with her 74 L@@ enses .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Stra√üe .
it helps refugees from Syria , Kur@@ dist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German .
of course , it is quite different from teaching than at a proper school .
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande fo@@ sters nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to elu@@ ci@@ date women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who su@@ ck breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system .
due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day .
however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary intervention that mothers should undertake .
a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tum@@ ours .
unfortunately , an un@@ healthy child &apos;s diet can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
exceptions for the new Bern@@ ried sports hall
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried authorised the construction application for the ‚Ç¨ 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be flat for solar installation .
the planning for the long @-@ awa@@ ited gym@@ nasi@@ um building on the Bern@@ ried sports grounds move forward step by step : in the recent community meeting , the prepared construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without large discussions .
&quot; &quot; &quot; prior to this , the board had decided , among other things , an application for a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; resp@@ ectable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was about permission for a special form regarding the roof structure . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; saddle roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should be erected with a non @-@ mitt@@ ent first and roof &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; roof &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; background planning is the envis@@ aged use of the roof surface for solar installations : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the case of &quot; liberation &quot; there was again the aff@@ ection required for energy reasons - unlike in the development plan - to be below ten degrees .
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because there were no &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to the roof inclin@@ ation - although Bern@@ ese Municipal Council is generally rather restric@@ tive when it comes to liberation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in gym@@ nasi@@ um construction , however , it is not a recur@@ ring project : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and SV Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros have been calculated at the expense .
grants are expected from school and Brei@@ ten@@ sport@@ f√∂rderung .
in the next stage of the procedure , the construction application for the 18 x 36 metre large hall is now presented to the Land@@ rats@@ amt for testing .
P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg Clinic moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Medical Director at the hospital of Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
this is what the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , which confirmed the coun@@ c@@ ill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
the Supervisory Board , however , will make a decision on this issue , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September .
if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work on the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg .
the vast majority of them should be reloc@@ ated to Sch@@ ong@@ au by fisher@@ man and the further existing In@@ ner station .
the rooms are available .
the employees who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a job at Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü .
the employees are informed of the plans .
the change has triggered the dis@@ miss@@ al of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the Medical Director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital .
the question of who to succeed him came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , the name &quot; Fischer , &quot; who agreed to take over the lead on October 1 and change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this was a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; appreciation &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and a broad@@ ening of the offer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; range , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fibr@@ ill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
over the next two years , Fischer and his team , if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves , will lead both houses , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which still has 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg after almost 140 years .
so far the county had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation has been completed at the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim .
coun@@ try@@ woman J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Wei√ü , who is also chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is owned by the Federal Council , will in future be used as housing for asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I exclude . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there are several considerations . &quot; &quot; &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily psychiat@@ ry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; what better couldn &apos;t happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which had been &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; positive and very understandable &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by the staff . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a real perspective for the house in which Fischer has been working as a chief physician for more than 30 years has not given it .
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ au &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
the hospital in P@@ ei@@ √üen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has always been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments were closed , for example surgery and obst@@ et@@ rics .

missed 16 year old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the body of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds , who have been missing from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz since Saturday .
in inter@@ ro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the teenagers were killed and their cor@@ p@@ ses were thrown into a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a 16 year old , who has been missing from Rheinland @-@ Pfalz since Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes .
the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , where the public prosec@@ utor and police ran on Wednesday .
in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old , who was arrested on Tuesday evening , was also deemed to have been arrested and the investig@@ ator led to the discovery site of the cor@@ p@@ ses .
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after having arrived home in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to an autumn feast in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman , the investig@@ ators first encountered personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the missing persons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 year old .
the alleged perpet@@ r@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the cor@@ p@@ se was found .
according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee alleged that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had killed and laid the cor@@ p@@ ses in the canal .
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the port Jud@@ ge on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a dead stop to him .
the investigation of the closer circumstances of the deed shall bring further investigations .
refugees need accommodation : study warned against apartment vulner@@ ability
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution fights on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with the arriving refugees and j@@ ob@@ seek@@ ers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they compete with income @-@ poor citizens about the last affordable housing .
to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units had to be built by 2020 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Social Res@@ idential Development Association &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
by comparison , 26@@ 0,000 units are finished in Germany this year .
thus 14@@ 0,000 apartments are missing .
after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial accommodation .
many then encounter the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers lived for rent in the last year .
however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the increasing numbers of refugees .
the study also makes substantial om@@ is@@ sions in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany is shooting an apartment deficit , which is increasing from year to year .
currently , around 77@@ 0,000 units were already missing in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias G√ºnther , author of the study , compl@@ ains .
many professionals were therefore living in large cities necessarily in flat @-@ room rooms .
&quot; &quot; &quot; young adults stayed longer in the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hotel M@@ um &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; because of the fur@@ y on the housing market . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in the big cities , the number of square meters per capit@@ a has dropped again for the first time in recent years .
in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot .
new incentives should boost social housing construction again .
this could be wai@@ ved on the Greenland tax and the base tax is suspended for subsi@@ dis@@ ed homes .
in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation options are necessary according to the Alliance .
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugees of the Kf@@ W is already well received in towns and communities .
a good week after the launch , more than half of the available around 300 million Euros have been retri@@ eved on Monday evening with 184 million euros .
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free terrain : Croatia and Slovenia set up corridor
there is practically no transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees are choosing the way over Croatia .
Zagreb is announc@@ ing the transit across Slovenia to the north without hur@@ dles .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I spoke to the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Croatian interior minister R@@ ank@@ o Ost@@ o@@ j@@ ic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU country Croatia is not yet a Schengen country . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe .
500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L .
on the eve of the day Hungary had sealed its border to refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new laws which entered into force on the same day make proper asylum procedures in Hungary virtually unnecessary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
these people are there , women , children and men who want to live and achieve something .
but there are people who didn &apos;t want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the border of Serbia in the morning .
most of the media reports came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan .
they arrived both on the bus and with taxis in the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not encounter borders .
there are other dangers for this : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance should now quickly establish a safe passage .
meanwhile , after the closure of the border , hardly any more refugees come to Hungary .
on Tuesday the police numbered 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the closing of the door on Monday , it had been 9@@ 380 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the new Hungarian laws force the overcoming and damaging of the border zone as a crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted are threatened with prison sentences up to five years and the deportation from the country .
according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications set up on the border set up at the border were accepted on Tuesday , nearly all of them - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
among the applicants are 13 families with small children and two elderly people .
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees .
practically nobody has a chance to get granted asylum in Hungary .
&quot; &quot; &quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; secure third country &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
workers began to clean up in R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke .
they collected garbage that had left tens of thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
scrap skel@@ et@@ ons were disman@@ tled and one of the recording stor@@ ages in the border town was rebuilt .
no @-@ one wanted to express itself to the goal of this reconstruction .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government information .
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for Germany to continue the journey .
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the instruction of German authorities .
in Frei@@ las@@ sing , small groups of refugees arrived at regular intervals .
mayor went &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest on Sunday we were busy with the show@@ rooms when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins May@@ ors Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
tourists , they wanted to go to Pas@@ sau by train .
because Germany had surprisingly stopped rail traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the flood of refugees it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; said Stad@@ ler who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the bor@@ dered together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Pas@@ sau .
prior to that , we first st@@ un@@ ned the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks .
we said the same , we bring them to Pas@@ sau by car .
&quot; it was a matter of course for us , &quot; said Stad@@ ler in the O@@ √ñ@@ N meeting .
they were very grateful .
a man could not take it to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we were very happy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the str@@ anded train passengers were moving from an ICE train to Pas@@ sau on Sunday evening in W@@ els , and after the short notice that the rail traffic was set to Germany , it was still possible to cross the border .
but the regional train was put off at the Inn before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border crossing is generally high in the course .
the Br√ºck@@ en@@ fest association was soci@@ able with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday , day before a two @-@ se@@ ater run spor@@ tily - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ √°n now sends more tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot; &quot; &quot;
instead of helping in the camp of R@@ √∂s@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures that guarantee humanity , our German Chancellor has officially opened up the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ circle of National Socialism .
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now faced with chao@@ tic conditions in the bor@@ der@@ lands .
&quot; &quot; &quot; also the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yellow country &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which has invited them and welcomed them , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it will be a great challenge in the face of the ongoing flood of refugees and the approaching winter to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seek@@ ers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and it will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria .
Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ resistant quarters
Konrad has to do all his hands fully with the support of refugees .
Christian Konrad is used to the fact that his word has weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up quarters for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at the First Tak@@ eover of Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no hom@@ eless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success .
even the placing of the 20,000 refugees , who had come to Austria on Monday , was without great vor@@ tices , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot;
in total , Konrad reck@@ ons with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 quart@@ ets in the qu@@ aint year .
in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations need to be found in the next weeks - 20,000 are supposed to provide countries , 15,000 of the federal government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he has already held talks with the Gover@@ nor .
they would have assured him of creating lod@@ gings even for the coming refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Upper Austria it &apos;s going well , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ ry Ma@@ ier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Sch√∂n@@ born , explaining how the Church will help .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the asylum coordinator also places great expectations in the ORF promotion &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps like us . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
private individuals can easily offer accommodation on the platform .
in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in the winter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Konrad and Ma@@ ier yesterday critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
in times of emergency , it cannot be that lod@@ gings must maintain a certain amount of the towel rack or the size of the harmon@@ ies .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; would have to apply for a temporary period . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Konrad , with his experience , is well @-@ founded that he is more successful in contra@@ distinction to the Interior Ministry .
I am an elderly gent@@ leman , whom one does not say without further notice of un@@ truth .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Ma@@ ier do not cause the Republic to cost as they themselves declared .
they want to increase the number of employees in three to four .
their own quest for accommodation hasn &apos;t been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Stephan@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for better distribution
the city of Linz is planning no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center to accommodate refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the suffer@@ ers can currently be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further sites should be tested for their suitability .
the Chief of the City of Germany critic@@ ises the division of refugees within the federal state .
other districts must also contribute here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed &quot;
in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ √ºhr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday massac@@ red further proceedings in refugee issue .
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however , there are now the corresponding border controls .
there will be no more special trains with refugees to Germany .
however , the seek@@ ers were brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by other EU member states , P@@ √ºhr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that Austria is now again introducing inspections to its borders , for P@@ √ºhr@@ inger , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a logical consequence &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; from the approach of the Germans . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general refur@@ bish@@ ment of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Linz Industrial Line has been officially completed .
in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT company S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 sq@@ .@@ m. ) , is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in IT the smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies in the New Shi@@ py@@ ard and later also to acquire them .
&quot; &quot; &quot; already from the start S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Euro 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the state of Upper Austria and the federal government ( FF@@ G ) .
the building is le@@ ased from the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 per cent there are inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second shop in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
actually J@@ utta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog .
this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she has now gained growth in the form of another business location .
in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop , where they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros .
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
previously , several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but I &apos;ve been thinking long if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the decision was , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own site , where only their hand@@ bags were sold .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we are the only ones in the great region of Linz that sell this brand , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who have even Italian roots . &quot; &quot; &quot;
her fashion interest has been brought to the cra@@ dle by her mother .
I like most if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
why so some woman is in rap@@ tures when seeing a beautiful hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with the last security .
perhaps it is due to the fact that a beautiful bag of every outfit is used .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called investors .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for ger@@ ms .
whether it is alien@@ ated from others , journalists are concerned or gaps in the international crisis policy are revealed - the candidate for the US Pres@@ idency boo@@ sts the election campaign vigor@@ ously .
and cuts off well .
this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire originates .
many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route , the New Yorker stands on the wine road .
some in the 1200 hab@@ it@@ ant village is related to it over nin@@ ety corners .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode .
the K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the vill@@ agers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their town of K@@ all@@ stadt , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ st√§d@@ ter shot an am@@ using documentary about the place and his famous offspring , to which besides Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt .
he did not bring it to the king of hearts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; although there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is a bit a big mouth &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; coinci@@ dentally , the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; l@@ ur@@ ked , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; - to High German : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so Tr@@ ump comes from the village of investors .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a place for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate purchases in New York .
but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long run failed in the Bavarian state , which the Pal@@ at@@ inate belonged to at that time .
he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he used to be cut off without permission , the director of the Institute of Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Eth@@ n@@ ology , Roland Paul , declared film launch .
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal immig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the occasionally marked statements of descendants .
he had repeatedly talked to Mexican immigrants in the United States and requested the construction of a boundary wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not so symp@@ a@@ thetic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement sees the Americans rather dis@@ soci@@ ated , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is always so susp@@ icious . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pension fund Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family during a visit ended something for the church organ , which was generally well anch@@ ored .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from the Donald , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you would find it better if he didn &apos;t choose the choice , because &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
if those who had sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are more interesting subjects than him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah B√ºh@@ ler . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; my president isn &apos;t it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Wend@@ els Film , which has long been inter@@ viewed for the Tr@@ ump , has seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA the interest awak@@ ens .
the Upper Bavarian Community of Ram@@ sau with Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain@@ eering village .

in the neighboring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; mountain@@ eering village &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; must have at most 2500 inhabitants . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sunrise manages the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in the Today Show
Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son rush to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report on the loss of leadership in the liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in the ratings for today .
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
the Ri@@ val Sunrise , with the pres@@ enters David Koch and Sam@@ anth@@ a Ar@@ my@@ tage , set in London as part of a one @-@ week series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Niag@@ ara Falls and Canc@@ un .
this down@@ side of the shelf didn &apos;t seem to play a role for Australian TV viewers , because sunrise achieved 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five major cities compared to today 33@@ 9.@@ 000 .
today , a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) .
today , the gap to Sunrise has closed in recent months .
in August , Today , Today reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0,000 of Sunrise .
at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 4@@ 0,000 and 50.000 .
so far , during September , sunrise is at 34@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at Today .
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change concern these early people more than the parliament !
Karl and Lisa are fine , thank you for the review !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former series of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children on the coast of New Zealand , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers .
critics have wonder@@ ed if Thom@@ son could have a hit show Solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the result of yesterday evening answered with a clear &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the X Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) .
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 pm ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ ef@@ e showed 44@@ ,000 spectators on average .
the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) .
on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia posted 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 s@@ atte in the second half hour .
average Hot @-@ Se@@ at average 6@@ 20,000 .
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ run Mc@@ Gu@@ ires &apos;s show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
to reveal secrets ? ...
L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor .
the woman , who finally lands Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before three of them , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner .
Sam Wood shut down his lips until the final on Thursday
all three women have left out in a ly@@ rical way why wood is the perfect man and they called his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner .
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; If not you , who should get W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be their answers to the game destro@@ yer who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot; &quot; &quot;
both Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ks both quickly named themselves - except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
from the first day Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood had a simple relationship with each other .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and re@@ marked ( Sarah ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows .
&quot; Sarah stands on earth with both feet , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki .
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house last week made it clear that Wood could be &quot; the one . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ conditional to him , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and when she was asked whom Wood should choose , if not she , then she was en@@ ig@@ matic .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
the Bachelor is broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 19 : 30 .

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent inquiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the ban@@ ker when he lost a don@@ or as he did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League converts at his first P@@ unt Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sulph@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a p@@ unt return and also in the running game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sulph@@ a continued to show his true face in the dressing room after the match .
instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them .
meanwhile , Hay@@ ne publicly supported Hay@@ ne during his press conference after the game .
the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ ph@@ ter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game .
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a p@@ unt that was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vik@@ ings
it was certainly not the start , which Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian team had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
after the F@@ um@@ ble Hay@@ ne moved the playing field and later told Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career ,
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the rac@@ er with his original debut back then in 2007 , when a pass at his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the Free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high numbers of refugees . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the beginning of the F@@ W Herbst@@ kl@@ au@@ sage in Gro√ü@@ vor@@ stadt before a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned : &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise we will get evaluations in the Bavarian education system . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land parliament session of the Free voters met in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune on Friday .
actually quite different main topics were fores@@ een .
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the Free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ v@@ wan@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN shel@@ ters for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugosla@@ v Wars during the 1990s .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is not the case , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Free Elec@@ toral Leader . &quot; &quot; &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to de@@ fer the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for this reason , Ai@@ van@@ ger also demanded more personnel for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ bol@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;

4 People killed after the police shoot rubber bul@@ lets on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal
four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd of people who demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday .
the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an@@ expan@@ i district , about 175 miles west of Kath@@ mand@@ u capital .
B@@ ish@@ n@@ u Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ k@@ al , Chief District Administrator , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , with some of you throwing stones and fire bombs .
Mr D@@ ha@@ k@@ al said the police have used tear gas and then shot into the air before they res@@ or@@ ted to rubber bul@@ lets .
20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said .
it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , of which it is known that they can kill , but are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , apparently produced such a high death rate .
the debate was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence .
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of T@@ arus who want their own state .
at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th century .
in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal that has been centrally ruled over for centuries .
working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April .
the legis@@ lators voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kath@@ mand@@ u , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday .
construction plan planned in the city
the land at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
planned is a mix of trade , commercial and living - but there are no concrete offers yet .
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market a plot of around 4000 square meters in close proximity to the Old Post Art Centre .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
it is planned to use the premises for a mix of trade , commercial and living .
you wait for appropriate offers , it is said by the city .
which investor may come into question is not yet clear .
no contracts have been signed accordingly .
the city of Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located on the Ring@@ stra√üe / corner Great Street , already a few months ago and the building that is located on it can be torn off .
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the little sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor made public plans for the project for the first time .
several investors are further worried - they fear the sale of their leisure facility
months had been negotiated , bar@@ bec@@ u@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors .
now the plans for a new holiday house on the little sea close to Em@@ den on the table .
the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized company &quot; System Construction , &quot; announced its plans for the first time publicly in the Council of the Council of the Council of the Council on Monday evening .
originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which repro@@ ached the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive with the system construction management : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors .
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the approximately ten to twelve million euro projects have been in discussion for months .
the photos and new details about the desired hotel construction were prov@@ oked by heavy reactions among the mer@@ cen@@ ary owners who had come into the meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the Meer@@ bus@@ ean and member of the board at the advoc@@ acy group of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will be a giant cla@@ p that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics , that the traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase sharply : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there must be whole bus@@ ses so that it calcul@@ ates , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is happening on the well @-@ known area of the former restaurant is still open .
there is no operator yet .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because this was still missing , the construction plans are still variable .

Google launches double donation campaign to collect 11 million $ for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a double donation campaign that aims to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees who have won the European Nations as they flee from war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to announc@@ ing the donations call on his blog .
instead of making a manager the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google collabor@@ ator who fled Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; our journey included many dark web and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but as the refugee and migrants &apos; crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot; &quot; &quot;
donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors Without Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es .
Google said that the first global donations up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / was doubled to $ 11 million .
Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year .
many also escaped from the war torn in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq , and Libya .

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly over@@ weight diab@@ e@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if slightly over@@ weight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot; &quot; &quot;
weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
over the years obesity research has been effective in treating type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are path@@ ologically obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher .
BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal from 18.@@ 5 to 24.@@ 9 .
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is over@@ weight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , which they collected in a study since 2007 , compare two types of obesity - stomach b@@ ypass and stomach ul@@ c@@ ers - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly over@@ weight .
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation fell from 31 to 24.@@ 5 by the end of the fifth year in this study .
meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately equal to 29 .
among those who underwent surgical intervention , 36 % of the diabetes had disappeared completely and at 28 % partial .
in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes loos@@ ed completely only at one percent and partially at only about two percent .
in addition , the results were better in the control of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; in general in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out .
the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time .
h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write .
after the operation , the average h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent .
in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent .
but this better &quot; gly@@ c@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved h@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , according to the Senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues .
the research team also compared the average results in the two types of surgery .
in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the gas rec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved greater responses in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and ha@@ emo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) .
while the new study showed no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix .
in the Swedish study it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people , about 29 percent less likely to die over the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods .
although the new study showed no benefit for survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation in this lower BM@@ I group is lower , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient &apos;s BM@@ I lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we are waiting too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly connected their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
love story plays in Hun@@ sr@@ √ºck
it is a topic that is increasingly attrac@@ ting attention in the fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ sigh@@ tly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and he falls in love with her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; so also in the recent novel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tually we are not so &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot; &quot; &quot;
beyond the love story , the novel might be interesting especially for Hun@@ sr@@ √ºck readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages .
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she was able to set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the hom@@ el@@ ands of refugees .
the Dalai Lama proposed the issue of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the UK in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given conditions the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you have to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ultimately , we need to think about how killing is reduced in their countries . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we need to reduce the use of violence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he added . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and commented also George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and emphasized that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; &quot; &quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I know his motives were good , but he used violence , and that caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot; &quot; &quot;
four@@ fold increase of taking of disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children over the last 4 years
poison control centres in the USA report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years , who swal@@ low strong alcoholic hand dis@@ infection , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center .
according to Dr Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of recei@@ pts of disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age reported the toxic@@ ity control centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; children are getting more and more interested in these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go to the emergency room , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he said that some children drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants intentionally while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ infection products drink only because of a cheap experience .
adolescents have allegedly mixed dis@@ infection products with alcohol containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to get a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive fragrances of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
there are disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing to children .
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in young children few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency center in the hospital of K@@ ans@@ as University , the Fox 4 station in H@@ ansa City . &quot; &quot; &quot;
so , you would not leave any si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume lots of alcohol .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently had four sy@@ ring@@ es taken by straw@@ berry du@@ ften@@ dem H√§n@@ de@@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants in the school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment .
her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally considered to be drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta .
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ur@@ ked her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
doctors monitored them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at the signs of Hir@@ n trau@@ ma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and had pushed the head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been deadly for my child .
Lop@@ ez recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store hands dis@@ infection products outside the child &apos;s reach .
in addition , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths from alcohol pois@@ oning .
in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing a toxic , un@@ declared ingredient .
employees of health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as active ingredient .
in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report .
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iled them from their room .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the police regarded the iced plan as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ossi@@ p &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary action to the school authority . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

the lack of title competition in Scottish football gets bored Dutch - de Bo@@ er
the former ran@@ ger @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there is no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the ran@@ gers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the R@@ angers &apos; return .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la .
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian chef s@@ wore to turn things around .
after the defeat against Malm@@ √∂ and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which is now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Celtic had already had bad times before and we will come again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens .
we feel that exactly like that - but we must go on .
we really need Celtic support because that makes the players better .
to stand up now is so important .

the Hear@@ ts led 2 : 1 when Pat@@ er@@ son was sent out of the field and lost 3 : 2 , but the Defender &apos;s Red Card was later lifted - the third Red Card of Coll@@ um , which was rev@@ oked in eight months .
&quot; &quot; &quot; N@@ eil@@ son remains what he said and insist@@ ed : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have no integrity in question , I have no performance commented . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Griff@@ i@@ ths swe@@ ars to avoid Ty@@ nec@@ ro@@ at

the incident occurred in a pub in the area of Ros@@ eb@@ urn of Edinburgh in front of a Edinburgh Der@@ by in Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le in March 2014 .
&quot; it was a Der@@ by , and it was the heat of the moment , &quot; said the storm and added : &quot; it is safe to say that I do not return to Ty@@ nec@@ ast@@ le if it doesn &apos;t play for Celtic Glas@@ gow . &quot;
Tan@@ na@@ va Supervisory Board trust in Dun@@ dee United @-@ Management
Simon Don@@ nel@@ ly insi@@ sts that the management team of Dun@@ dee United still has confidence in the management team to turn things - but it says that the decline has to end on the playing field .

&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ nes is happy to be &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ happy &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; against Hamilton . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ In@@ nes ad@@ mits that his team from Aber@@ deen had to fight against Hamilton Ac@@ cies in order to see a seventh sequ@@ el of the league which gave them a lead of five points on the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ In@@ nes said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there is no team who won everything , in po@@ calyp@@ se or le@@ agues , the games of this kind have not won . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it is rising in total .
unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without labour for the UK as a whole rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period .
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as shown by the Fig@@ ures of Office for National Statistics ( O@@ NS ) .
meanwhile employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 .
in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK @-@ average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government &apos;s long @-@ term plan laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is almost exactly one year that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the UK .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot; &quot; &quot;

why I am witness@@ ing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
somewhat later , except for late legal intervention , I will see a man being brought to death .
when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison injection .
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
the invitation was for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shock@@ ed I agreed .
when the day came near@@ er , I began to fear .
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and as there are often more applications available than seats , a mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery takes place in order to decide who is elected .
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emo@@ tionally .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p &apos;s closest friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
the prison authorities say I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and pen to record what I see .
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants it , and you get access .
I compl@@ ained to her .
&quot; &quot; &quot; she admitted that she &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could have done better &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I do . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it .
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international repor@@ ter to be present to write there .
if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty .
Kim Bell@@ ware , a repor@@ ter at the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me .
if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made .
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details here .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard G@@ los@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Bar@@ ry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a fav@@ ored deed .
but I think there is a strong probability that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think that his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I will see him dying .
I can &apos;t claim to be really objective .
there will be other repor@@ ters you can contact for .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police ch@@ ase persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polishing was dry when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River .
an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to stop the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters away from a police officer trying to &quot; persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a domestic peac@@ eke@@ eping incident in Pel@@ vic .
when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of the C@@ anning River .
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ins . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he applied a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A good polic@@ eman is negoti@@ ating . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ins .
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins drove his car in the dit@@ ch to escape an alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River .
his efforts were un@@ successful , but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claimed that Ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity department of Racing Victoria and claimed that they carried out a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday .
Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it was about the positive cob@@ alt @-@ tu@@ bing trial of Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age accus@@ ations and did not want it to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; look like too highly dro@@ op@@ ing grapes . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they know that it continued .
sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with that which I have said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
I want to walk around the head and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them .
if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer .
I have to think about what I do with my license .
prior to that , Moo@@ dy had shown the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Day@@ ale Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on rac@@ ing@@ .com .
they seem to believe that I am a dec@@ eiver .
if that is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses , because they have failed in trying to grasp me .
Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , reig@@ ning president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ gem , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of it at that time and are still today .
should this bring me to the conclusion that it will be personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L have a cow@@ ard@@ ly behaviour and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
perhaps they must take my license and drive me away , and I have no doubt that what I say can now be thought about .
but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad .
that really makes me sad .
I will ex@@ ert pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
the training levels of the trainer set up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching led him to say that he could &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ varnis@@ hed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse debate , which viol@@ ated the rules .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; one of my employees mira@@ cul@@ ously applied mud on the leg . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it could have been so last night .
it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so .
but it was also the same on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could be faced with a three month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy withdraw@@ s against ri@@ vals due to claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has described criticism at the tac@@ kl@@ ing of its players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favorites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm players &quot; ring battles &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Way@@ ne Benn@@ ett made a hardly disgu@@ ised note to the Storm team after his team achieved the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; prime example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land are not &quot; too good &quot; in struggle .
Bell@@ amy defended the tac@@ it@@ lim@@ g of his team and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; contact &quot; at the Tac@@ kl@@ ing .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried that they were worried about being beaten by the storm team .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this always appears - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson said about ring@@ ing when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I can guarantee that we have changed nothing to our defensive system or techniques all year long , but over the past six weeks we have made contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es a real focus , and this has been the trend revers@@ al for us .
Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . therefore , he is probably not used to losing , so it was a bit of a shock for him .
it &apos;s funny how it always appears at this time of year .
Bell@@ amy attacked Benn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts de George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her play was , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I remember that in 2010 , St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he would take care of a dirty trick .
but now he has a team that can play and that we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed .
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben H@@ unt , so they can play like this .
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago , they did not think about us when it was about Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm vs. R@@ oo@@ sters achieved a higher result than the game of Bron@@ co against cow@@ boys .
the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ?
our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ?
or are breaks doing and no points something exciting ?
for me it is the game plans .
when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in a phase .
the Storm team has free this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on Saturday night in the final at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
Ser@@ bier with $ 200,000 deposit after drug ad@@ dict
a man who might face a life sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , which were s@@ mu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 .
Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ end@@ ants in the marina in the morning and later in the Caf√© Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
despite a possibly lifel@@ ong penalty for attempting to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the entire crowd and that in the caf√© it could have been for a harmless reason .
the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the danger of escape with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday .
in case of a criminal complaint , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security to achieve his release .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after reading the statements of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Jud@@ ge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned .
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on ba@@ il under the conditions that he resig@@ ns to his Australian and his Serbian pass , reports to the police every day and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 .
an accident on A5 at Karlsruhe : driving cab tears apart
in case of a collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening .
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to devi@@ ate at the last moment to the left as the police announced .
the car &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
a damage amoun@@ ting to 12@@ 2.000 Euro was incurred .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ t used the phone of an 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone as he was sleeping , logging into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a series of in@@ consistent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl a@@ wo@@ ke later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and al@@ armed immediately her mother .
the police looked at it and saw the five images , then analysed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; concerning &quot; web searches that used terms for searching for in@@ consistent images of children .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it because it would lead to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es on the Internet &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and he then &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten her . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said it would be addic@@ tive - that he is addic@@ ted to frigh@@ ten people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he admitted that searches were carried out on the computer by him , but said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman in order to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ op@@ hil@@ es .
he was asked for his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did so to enti@@ ce her .
he said he was ill in the head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder .
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was on the trem@@ bling and crying .
she then saw the rest@@ less images on the phone and confronted the def@@ end@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused Computer and Pla@@ yst@@ ation used to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty according to the indictment , to have in@@ consistent pictures taken by children on 14 June last year , to viol@@ ate the obligations on 25 January of this year and not to appear before court at a hearing on March 24 of this year .
&quot; &quot; &quot; attorney Greg@@ ory S@@ im asked Ho@@ gg to appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders as one could argue that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; could be found in his crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff A@@ list@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael wa@@ sted his sentence until October to receive background reports on social work .
in this case Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings to other still pending cases .
it was added before the date of the verdict in the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
valves sof@@ ten on small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken up from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many bad users were frigh@@ tened of the discovery and arrest of people more often at smaller border cross@@ ings .
on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said .
since Tuesday , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up along the Inn River Inn in Pas@@ sau and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn .
they were on foot over bridges and shr@@ u@@ bs to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police officers and forwarded to the registration .
in the Munich Central Station , there were again clearly more refugees arriving after the Federal Police in comparison with the start of the week on Wednesday .
until 8 : 00 hrs there were about 700 people in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning .
after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday .
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; Exp@@ ected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists are warning of storm ra@@ mps in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , hot sea air is currently flowing into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the powerful low is the prec@@ ursor of the Trop@@ ical storm &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; which was drawn over the Atlantic in the last few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot; &quot; &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
according to DW@@ D it is also possible to calculate in the Black Forest until Thursday morning , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Alps and in the under@@ sea price with bows of 60 to 90 kilometers per hour .
on Friday the sun will last longer .
the crowd makes it : every two years the automotive industry shows their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
in 2015 , the compact cars are particularly popular in the compact cars , which are currently selling very well .
the compact class cars are currently in demand : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were ac@@ counted for by the German Federal Force ( Bundes@@ amt ) ( KBA ) alone in August .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
this year , many new compact models will be presented in particular between all fut@@ uris@@ tic concept vehicles and new luxury cars .
one of the biggest premier@@ es for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn .
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann .
it belongs to the core of the brand .
so that the volume model is also sold well , the new Astra is not supposed to be much more expensive .
Opel makes an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf in prospect that starts at 17,@@ 650 euros .
the current Astra costs from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
in addition , the Hessen offers further diesel and gasoline engines from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , including three @-@ cylinder gasoline engines for the first time .
unlike the main competitors Volkswagen Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only five @-@ door .
the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA .
and what will next to the Astra at the IAA take a closer look at new compact cars ?
Renault M√©@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor M√©@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair , the M√©@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and sporty GT version .
in the trade , he comes at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i .
Infin@@ iti : brand new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
with the new model , the Nissan dam wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment .
the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line .
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but in the offer is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp .
the maximum torque according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications is 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA .
on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ √´@@ n counter@@ part laid hands on the front part : here the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ painted and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology .
in the interior , the inf@@ otainment system was modernis@@ ed above all , reducing the number of buttons by a touch screen and integrated with Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play .
in addition , at the IAA in the compact class there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants , such as the f@@ ished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI .
J@@ VA Berlin Te@@ gel : five square meters of cells are human un@@ worthy
the Federal Constitutional Court admitted to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary Te@@ gel who was lod@@ ged in a small cell for months .
because of the violation of their human dignity , det@@ ain@@ ees are generally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells .
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
according to the judges , the judges can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
thus an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space in the Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel prison facility between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was spati@@ ally dis@@ connected .
after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer &apos;s information , has meanwhile been on the bare foot , had been moved to a larger cell .
his administrative liability due to the un@@ worthy conditions of arrest against the country of Berlin failed .
but the Constitutional Court raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber judgment and returned the case back to the examination .
they see the human dignity of the man injured .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
even if for legal reasons of the question@@ able period only a few days of adher@@ ence to compensation were decisive , a compensation claim was given , it was said .
&quot; &quot; &quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a da@@ w@@ ning of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court &apos;s Court must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
in the past , the Constitutional Jud@@ ges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war .
so they only asked a prisoner in April because he was naked in a cell .
according to a decision from 2011 , the multip@@ lication of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy .
furthermore , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had certified an in@@ humane treatment to a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 .
for three months the plain@@ ti@@ ff lived between 15 to 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
over the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also hit the head@@ lines for lack of staff .
prisoners are therefore always locked for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness is rising , even to ra@@ ckets it should have been due to the ten@@ se situation .
according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 points in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of offspring , 19 will fall away in 2016 .
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what to do in Germany ?
according to forecasts of the Federal Ministry of the Interior , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers will come to Germany this year , according to the statements of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees .
&quot; &quot; &quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
what is coming to Germany gives the following overview .
according to different forecasts , between 3@@ 50@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are annually - and indeed for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental properties : every year , 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social housing will drop out of the rental price , and these particularly cheap apartments will also apply to refugees .
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros .
much too little is that from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : there would have to be 80 000 social housing a year and the federal government would have to invest 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year .
in common , scientists and federal finance ministers agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in housing construction .
according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research ( Institut f√ºr Arbeitsmarkt@@ - und Berufs@@ forschung ) it is assumed that 55 percent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term .
however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , critic@@ ises Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
but for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial if they find employment in Germany .
work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ ust@@ hardt .
in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political turning point : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise work .
while there was an early ban on asylum seek@@ ers for up to five years , this was reduced in November 2014 to three months , as well as the residence light that limits asylum seek@@ ers to a residence .
in society - even because of the lack of skilled labour - the perspective prevailed , that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market more quickly .
the lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market .
up to now there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses .
studies also show that jobs are most often communicated through personal contacts .
for this reason , the structure of networks is based on the view of th@@ ron@@ hardt the K√∂nigs@@ weg zur Labour Integration .
the Berlin school administration has found that only a few refugees give their children to Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the ro@@ oting parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ eln@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration .
to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the ita , the management hand@@ book distri@@ butes in different languages .
should the need for educ@@ ators rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for example by allowing more technical schools .
in the countries , students are prepared for lessons without knowledge of German in welcome classes .
but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in German as a second language .
there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ range from the Berlin school administration .
the German Studenten@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
in principle , no federal state prohi@@ bits asylum seek@@ ers or mem@@ o@@ irs - the only exception to date has been Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his position .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated to access the university . &quot; &quot; &quot;
because refugees with a reimbur@@ sement or cancellation do not receive services according to the asylum application law more if they start studying .
the latter basically does not receive a b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of eligible persons .
tolerated refugees have been living in Germany for four years so far , to be eligible for B@@ af@@ √∂@@ g , from 1 January 2016 , this span shor@@ tens up to 15 months .
but also this funding gap must be closed , ask Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk .
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ √∂@@ g .
Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many religion is an important part of their identity .
the state ought to succ@@ essively clear up the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and the existing state @-@ church law to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship .
it would also be important to establish an Islamic Wel@@ fare Association that takes care of newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control options .
this also includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concerns on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought in to Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; those who wanted to off@@ end such conflicts in Germany &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society even more today than today .
in order for the majority society to change , the reduction of discrimination and ra@@ cism is more pressing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination site and a general gender equality law for over a decade . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U toll series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive systematically .
equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans for a long time require and why international agreements such as anti @-@ ra@@ cism prevention Germany undertake , must become reality in the coming years if the country is peaceful and its new citizens should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all .
in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the previously expected refugees , says District physician Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in terms of man@@ power and capacity , we create it , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
however , additional money must flow into the system .
in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery asks all the newcom@@ ers to issue health cards immediately .
services rendered could later be ac@@ counted for by the federal states .
and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to travel so many people with the limited service catalogue that the asylum application law fores@@ ees .
otherwise , the doctors make the language barrier above all .
already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are getting worse informed about their diseases than other patients .
not only in clinics , even in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs would have to be taken over , she demands .
many refugees , however , were already helped with more general medical stops in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there are clearly more un@@ addressed obstruc@@ tions among refugee children , and with the young people it is about HIV education . &quot; &quot; &quot;
German doctors , however , clearly come from their training with the partly different illnesses , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and as far as the shortage of doctors is concerned , the refugees may even be allevi@@ ated . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors .
in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take tests again .
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are psych@@ ologically ill according to estimates by the Bundes@@ psycho@@ therap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most people suffer from post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
refugee children are particularly vulnerable , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K .
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee girl is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
those who are ill in a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death distress .
other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , strong fri@@ ght and emotional de@@ af@@ ness .
in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z .
up to now , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psycho@@ therapy .
ad@@ mitt@@ edly , psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers can submit an application for psycho@@ therapy in the social offices , but treatment usually takes several months .
in addition , in the social offices mostly cler@@ ical workers or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether or not a therapy is necessary .
this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z .
Man@@ ege invites you to dream
with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus arts .
the goal is to draw every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment .
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dream in the Man@@ ege on the brick kil@@ n .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior chef . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - this is the motto under this motto .
the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family for more than 33 years .
thus the gift to spiritu@@ alists lies in the blood .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important for us to get people away from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with cos@@ mop@@ olitan flair &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot; &quot; &quot;
50 cities on the almost 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the cir@@ cus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from all over the world .
excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian St@@ oli@@ ar@@ ov C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the audience with w@@ it and charm .
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
with the heroes of the silent films the Cu@@ ban duo will take up loose .
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts by storm .
besides numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst fascin@@ ates with dex@@ ter@@ ity and dex@@ ter@@ ity .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yuan .
sn@@ akes fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and fascin@@ ates with her mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; empha@@ sizes Stephan@@ ie &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst .
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of cir@@ cus animals are only too often the subject of different animal welfare organizations .
Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst looks like this : &quot; if our animals are not good , we don &apos;t do well either . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every match unit .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; four leg@@ ged artists &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , are picked up by the eyes whenever possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
if the animal does not feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena .
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
specially on her zeb@@ roid JU@@ MB@@ O , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a Zeb@@ ra@@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud .
the two animals lived together eight years in one enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but then suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the zeb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; Stephan@@ ie Pro@@ bst says : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 people , we always do our best and are there with all your heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to his ideas every day from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program ki@@ cks off at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 pm the prices are reduced .
in addition , the animal show is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm .
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a wrong speech in parliament
Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year .
he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly across the social media .
the Parliament &apos;s opening was also clou@@ ded with alleg@@ ations by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with calls .
in the past month they had rested and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the Nation - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that they warned against interfer@@ ing with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the news comes from a number which is not shown , but it has the title &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; death &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it warns the members of parliament that the immunity is ending in Parliament and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Chief Executive Officer said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; worried &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; about the dangers for politicians . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard deplo@@ ys up to 30,000 jobs
Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services .
later this year HP will split up into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job cuts result in a burden exceeding 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new Hew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who is to lead the unit after separation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than it is today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; will be focused on providing hitherto un@@ successful , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explains the company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930 &apos;s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill Hew@@ lett and Dave Packard , in order to manufacture electro @-@ systems and their Pal@@ o Alto garage one called &quot; the birth place of the Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has under@@ gone a massive restructuring to manage the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
the HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance .
FC Arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta states that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it wasn &apos;t until September and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optim@@ istic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will surely miss at least the next four games for England and in the face of his story , his involvement in the next summer will certainly be uncertain .
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to its old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten car@@ eers , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is no longer a matter .
this was just an accident .
it did not stand in connection with his kn@@ u@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknowledged , there is the danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season .
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
pre@@ mier Inj@@ uries Ltd. reviews 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since its debut six years ago .
it also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ al 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the broader picture for Arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six out of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 that have suffered most of the vulner@@ abilities .
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsen@@ al believes that improvement in the injury rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have a vulnerable time period , a time in which you will have to strengthen your body and gain strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said .
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves .
arsen@@ al starts his Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces a rotation within the team .
H@@ √©@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ √≠n and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Ma@@ th@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start .
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I try to keep balance and treat the players who need it to take a little break &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
even though Arsen@@ al &apos;s favorites are to move on through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation effect in Europe .
dynam@@ o is unbe@@ aten even after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
the stadium was shaken on Tuesday evening by an earthquake , measured on the Richter scale 3,@@ 2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that Arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the past season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by the distant hope to lead the club to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot; &quot; &quot;
arsen@@ al has never worked out yet .
we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic .
we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers .
friendship Fest : the Com@@ edy @-@ Show , which gives us serious lessons on men friend@@ ships
the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now has become more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high .
in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women .
in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ aig@@ n Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m - Camp@@ aig@@ n against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man with the goal of asking the culture that prevents men from looking for help if they need them .
friendship is the heart of the struggle to tackle this challenge .
a recent study of more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms found that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery doubled .
for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems .
but of course you have to have friends for a friendship .
in the age of communication guided by social media , with their focus on style over substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact .
our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality isolation is domin@@ ating .
this super@@ ficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of intrin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper .
and as a video game invent@@ or and billi@@ on@@ aire recently explained , money can really not buy happiness .
the nice thing about Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which gli@@ mmer@@ ed through interaction as a friend .
the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when watching football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all of this came from knowing that men can definitely refer to it , even if they are often restra@@ ined to fully explore their feelings .
&quot; &quot; &quot; as an employee of the phone pastoral care told me : ... &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ ely endangered has shown me clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider @-@ status over the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why don &apos;t you then take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k .
or , even better , if you see someone sitting around in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say hello .
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the entire 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to gr@@ ind Malm@@ √∂
angel Di Maria is celebrating his match against Malm@@ √∂ with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani .
di Maria makes her debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to move past Malm@@ √∂ .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ √∂ in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ st@@ adion on Tuesday .
di Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who took the French champion , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally reached their advantage when Cav@@ ani gained a head @-@ ball in the 6@@ 1st minute .
with Real Madrid and Transpar@@ et@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , since they not only asp@@ ire to the qualification for the kno@@ ck @-@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns .
but while they got the points , it was not a classic game of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was replaced later in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 .
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , to cause problems to our opponents and to look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; said Blanc .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals scored . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which last weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was ej@@ ected in the fourth minute by Di Maria .
the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing stor@@ mer was called the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United and he pointed out why when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti &apos;s pass behind the Malm@@ √∂ defense , before he passed Johan Wil@@ and in the long corner of the net .
however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed .
Malm@@ √∂ , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to achieve this level , joined at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was lined up with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field str@@ ung a heavy opponent .
but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola Dj@@ ur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps Pop@@ es in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack .
instead , PS@@ G sometimes abandoned itself , with some mis@@ passes and bad deals , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had scrat@@ ched no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ bo@@ oting .
nevertheless , he proved much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , turning Di Maria into a shot that was passed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole ...
the second door finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . thus the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth season gate after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ √∂ can return to the game , and only an excellent intervention by Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz could keep the end result down before a replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi arrived at the end .
the trainer of Malm@@ √∂ , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December .
since then , we have only played in the Swedish League that does not have the same level .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the qualifying games are not enough . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
hats off to Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
the FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , who at that time played for the FC Barcelona .
eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion league winner , two times club champion , twice champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning .
in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi now reveals that he stood before the European Championship before his departure from Barcelona .
&quot; I told me that Bar@@ √ßa wanted to sell me . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 J√ºrgen Klin@@ smann acquired the FC Bayern .
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this today is working for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; &quot; &quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bar@@ √ßa has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championships . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with that he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bavaria over the entire distance on the lawn , folded the reds ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated King &apos;s triumph .
matt Dam@@ on Pla@@ ys Vari@@ ety in Film Mak@@ ing
matt Dam@@ on confronted the Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion of the diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
during a episode of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown dis@@ rupted the need for alternative perspectives , with regard to a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen scenario of the project .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the filling of the film and not with the instrumentation of the show , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot; &quot; &quot;
brown re@@ acted shock@@ ed , with s@@ worn un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! W@@ ow . okay , &quot; as the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian un@@ le@@ ashed .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producers Ben Aff@@ l@@ eck and Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to invite people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how they treat the figure of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Brown said at first . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the only black person , and she is a nut beaten by her white hal@@ ves .
the producer of Dear White People dealt with the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the film direc@@ ting rights ; Dam@@ on replied that her direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni pushed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talking about the only black person in the room so he can explain her variety - this is SO K@@ NO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 Ret@@ re@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication .
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact ra@@ cial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement achieved nationwide impact and repres@@ sed law@@ makers and authorities to cur@@ b discri@@ min@@ atory practices against coloured co@@ hes@@ ion .
in February , Prince Prince made an all@@ usion to the movement during the launch of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; album still@@ matter &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
like books and black life , albums still have their meaning .
recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter have published an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News Person@@ ality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate @-@ group .
&quot; the Network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders .
recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le who are invited to visit the Pope to discuss the depic@@ tion of the Catholic Church in the West .

&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned First Champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operating help Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ .
the competition show , which had just finished their 7th season , had never experienced a contest participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course .
during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the final .
the last task was climbing on a 75 @-@ foot @-@ long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge in three seconds faster , which made him the winner .
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! messages after the hard @-@ won victory , still under shock over the win of the big price of $ 1 million .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about , I &apos;ve never earned more than 10,000 $ or had life , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot; &quot; &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Repor@@ ter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , although he first ended the course at all , did not receive any prize money .
after the rules , money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the person gets the fastest time , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and changes life , it receives the great rati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;ll have any gru@@ dge over it .
he is just so happy to have done what he has done .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
and I think that Isaac would have felt the same if they had replaced the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
they used to be one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand in the last place in the American League Central .
the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins earned a chance to climb inside a gaming half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League wild@@ card space .
for Detroit , al@@ beit only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word that was so hard to sum over a large part of the second half of the season .
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad mus@@ h .
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support when Detroit punc@@ tured three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Simon said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is hard to throw in the bull &apos;s pen every game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game .
the designated Tiger @-@ Hit@@ ter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two ranks , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August .
it was Mart@@ ine@@ z &apos;s first three @-@ hit game ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he has sw@@ ung the head@@ piece , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he looked good at ( kick training ) , looked clearly better off in the bul@@ l@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game .
with three R@@ uns in the rear meeting at the end of the seventh year , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into play .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a st@@ unt , and Simon brought his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
Har@@ dy survived the wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designed ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who caught a Two @-@ Run on the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen .
with a pair of runners and the closing @-@ run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play .
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe made a Double Play
after Detroit added an Insurance Run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , the wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 .
however , the right @-@ h@@ anders cancel S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for his fifth Save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game by a still not moving Phi@@ l Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers achieved three ranks in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been painted before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had missed more than a month because of a back suffering .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I &apos;ve wanted , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch there in the third inning . &quot;
after getting the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ B@@ atter in the first , Hus@@ a gave a single to Second bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler .
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; in the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 series of successes with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
the third bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ an@@ os followed with a single on the right , and made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to reach the third , which ended the threat .
the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a one @-@ out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single of Center Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE for 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; it was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ it@@ or .
he didn &apos;t hit very well , but he caught the right spot .
Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch coun@@ tdown , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter .
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ k@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of a violation of the throwing shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z Sh@@ oul@@ der in 2007 .
San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list because of a shoulder @-@ sh@@ red@@ ding , is supposed to be activated for the start on Wednesday .
with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is painted by the vulner@@ ability to start against the T@@ wins .
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he has been missing since 20 August because of a guess in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three playing field trials on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin san@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees are to come in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on their way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
the people in it will then be accommod@@ ated in shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening .
it estimated that there were 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1,000 refugees can be temporarily accommod@@ ated there .
they will then be distributed to other communities .
in the past ten days , according to the government pres@@ idency , responsible for the initial recording , there were 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse .
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls due to the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; he accused the European states of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; collective departure . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
four years ago , one was happy that the cup of military involvement in Germany passed .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; now the conflict is crashing down at our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled at Southern and Eastern borders
after Germany , Austria again introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders .
on Tuesday evening , Austrian Minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , Austrian Minister for Television broad@@ ca@@ ster ORF , announced that no @-@ one will be returned to Hungary .
Germany too has not sent refugees back to Austria .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; no , it is so agreed &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; she explained . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the question of an agreement on which Germany could receive a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director of Public Safety and representatives of Germany .
she did not call her concrete numbers and referred to discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the past few days tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria through the so @-@ called Balkan Route .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit together with several other EU heads of state and government for the next week .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have not so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the coming Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers plan to take a new approach to the binding distribution of more than 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in view of the strong refugee report in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the initial acceptance and distribution of people . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour deliber@@ ations with the Prime Minister in the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Merkel under@@ lined that those people who would need protection would receive this too . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but if you don &apos;t have a lead perspective , you can &apos;t stay in Germany .
this view was strongly dealt with in the round .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; huge effort of strength . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that the border to Romania could be fitted with a fence .
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary wanted to prevent tu@@ g@@ boat routes from Romania , Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports , thousands of migrants lost their way to the Greek border .
spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us sw@@ aps a global ocean .
researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; concluded .
therefore the moon dan@@ gling easily on its orbit around the ring planet .
although this movement of do@@ ve is only small , but still too large for a permanent heavenly body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( New York State ) from Tuesday .
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
for some time it was known that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the south pole of the Satur@@ nian moon in 2006 , sp@@ ying water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feeding the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; E @-@ Ring &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
at least at the South Pole , there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers formed back then .
however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear .
R@@ ama is missing 1860 M√ºnchen for several weeks
the 1860 M√ºnchen must abst@@ ain from Val@@ det R@@ ama , an offensive player , for about one month .
an investigation resulted in an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury resulting from the 27 @-@ year @-@ old , the association informed .
R@@ ama had compl@@ ained about pain at the beginning of the week .
according to the Munich lions the diagnosis is &quot; presumably four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ etic loss . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Sports Director Nec@@ at Ay@@ g√º@@ n of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper with a look at the possible commitment of an un@@ compromising pro@@ s . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man .
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was also under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Cro@@ at is currently &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the possibility to demonstrate his skills . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;

contrary to the first fears he remained without a severe cens@@ orship .
no diet fruit - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy and sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
man@@ goes contain a relatively large amount of sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose .
the exotic fruits are healthy despite the fact that B vitamins are in them as well as the vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor , beta @-@ car@@ ot@@ ene .
those who eat the fruits thus support ey@@ es@@ ight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body .
when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell .
the peel color alone doesn &apos;t say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
then they taste of course pure or in sweet dishes .

the U.S. parcel service UPS supplies up to 9@@ 5000 aids for the Christmas business in the United States .
the company already started recru@@ iting seasonal workers , UPS announced on Tuesday .
most of all drivers are being sought .
last year , UPS had increased its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 aids .
in view of the bo@@ oming online business , UPS and his competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements for the Christmas business since last year .
in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the parcel service .
first fo@@ aming @-@ storm , then distinctive cold front
in the coming night in the valleys of the north side of the F@@ √∂hn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland announced on Tuesday .
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the F@@ √∂hn blows partly with storm strength through the cili@@ atory valleys .
after pam@@ per@@ ing on Thursday morning , we cross a distinctive cold front that brings strong rainf@@ alls , wind gu@@ sts and a temperature decline .
as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area across the British Is@@ les in a strong south @-@ west current .
on the side of the mountain , on the night , the F@@ √∂hn winds through the valleys .
in a row , the F@@ √∂hn blows on Thursday morning in the for@@ eh@@ n valleys with bows of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ i @-@ country partly also with more than 100 km / h .
the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places until the adjacent middle @-@ country , and on the mountains even Or@@ kan@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible .
while in the North on Wednesday , a stor@@ my hair dryer provides summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity of the Alpine slope begins to st@@ ow .
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
in total , more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected south of the Alps in the next 48 hours , this after large rainf@@ alls have already fallen in recent days .
on Thursday morning , the F@@ √∂hn winds the air , as a result a cold front bo@@ ils with a strong , partly ge@@ wit@@ ched rain from west to east via Switzerland .
together with the cold front , the wind will fres@@ hen up to a stor@@ my pace , and temperatures are rising significantly .
the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees .
Rome has now a Martin Luther Square
almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome .
in the presence of Mayor Ig@@ na@@ zio Marino there was christ@@ ened a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; at the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he is now recognized as the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was proposed by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could often only live in secret for centuries as a minority .
in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome .
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as a seed of sin .
according to histori@@ ans , his negative impressions are likely to have encouraged him in his later struggle against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his theses on the decay .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt imagined for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which has now appeared with splendid pictures .
in the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 motifs his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
&quot; &quot; &quot; his &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative shapes has received the 75 year old - but this is by no means the same with &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; funny &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; images . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this may seem quite glo@@ omy .
for about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective artistic selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books .
these are cycles that dev@@ ote themselves to topics such as cross roads , pl@@ agues , commandments or fa@@ therhood .
he was immediately fascinated by several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with its emphasis on art books .
and there is above all the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting .
he has interpreted the biblical texts selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into current contexts .
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
they are embedded between the original scrip@@ ture of Martin Luther and one set of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts about the situation here .
the cord has golden letters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old twice has a deep insight into his soul , his emotions .
this is a high degree of intim@@ acy .
ultimately , emotions were the trigger for the bi@@ ble project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin in 1940 , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Gl@@ orious Order .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since the education already took place with the cane , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt re@@ members . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to work on it so as to bring me back to the Lord again . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
his second concern is to revi@@ ve the art of art in a very short time : &quot; the perception of visual worlds is influenced by advertising today , and it is loud .
symboli@@ sm is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Alt hopes that the viewer can &quot; sne@@ ak up &quot; into the images , let them look at themselves , discover and sense what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
I have not paid attention to the fact that the Bible is fully compreh@@ ended , but the topics that are important to him , also mysterious .
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about images , the text merely explains . &quot; a picture Bible was created .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for Hans M@@ √∂h@@ ler from the Luther @-@ Verlag this work is an invitation to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ √∂h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opening in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation on November 15 .
construction of construction for BM@@ X railway is approaching
plans made , place found , company commissioned to model Earth moun@@ ds for a circular course : one year later almost everything was done - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train it was already over again .
om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration caused dr@@ uss , especially among residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railways .
so hill de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and application for building permission .
the approval will be received in October , the First District Apostle Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to communicate in the Child and Youth Committee .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I hope that this year will happen even more visi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; she said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it should then be started with the work of the former indoor swimming pool without a &quot; further break . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies commitment to refugees
the DF@@ B wi@@ dens its commitment to refugees until 2019 , while the Bundes@@ liga is pointing a clear mark on the weekend .
football respon@@ ds to the escal@@ ating situation in Germany and ass@@ ures its help in tackl@@ ing the upcoming problems .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; there can be no one in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this must be interesting for everyone to get a grip on this issue , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I am in the chan@@ cell@@ or next Wednesday and meet the Minister of State , Ms √ñ@@ z@@ ƒü@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this will surely play a central role , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot; &quot; &quot;
football can and may help .
but the decisive course must place politics .
the German Football League has therefore expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; via the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Stiftung we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stated Nier@@ s@@ bach on the fr@@ inge of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot; &quot; &quot;
some Federal Li@@ sts also support this program .
already this weekend the 36 professional clubs put a clear sign when they will bear the print &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; on the left tri@@ cot @-@ sleeve , instead of the usual sponsor@@ ship logo ( Her@@ mes ) .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can only , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Motorsport Director Rud@@ i V√∂l@@ ler , the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Bild &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the refugee drama goes every day , nobody can see it away . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we can ban football allies , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; H@@ offen@@ heim CEO Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; prominent sign of the league &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Cup against Hungary this Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Nier@@ s@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
that all 36 licence agreements had started their own projects in their places was great .
just as great is that small and small clubs are active there .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the message &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we spent is lived in football . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in this and the next year , the association will provide 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the clubs have also called up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; reported Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot; &quot; &quot;
reports : chief Apostle Hel@@ ps an eye on an accident
the CEO of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA he fell to a water jar after midnight , which he carried in his left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he almost ble@@ eds , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out on the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; fully working &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S√ºd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead the software company . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it is important to stand up again when you fall . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen without skir@@ mis@@ h ...

Gut@@ or@@ f@@ √∂l@@ de : detached house in nice sunny situation .
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken up .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the football league in Du@@ el with the FK K@@ ras@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.@@ 00 hrs / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we can &apos;t use it , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ch@@ el on Wednesday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; whether Re@@ us will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga Top@@ spiel against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
given the high burden of its pro@@ s , Tu@@ ch@@ el will not only change its parent @-@ elf on the Re@@ us position .
he announced a change on the door@@ keeper &apos;s position .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of Roman b√ºr@@ ki .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he trains on an absolute top level , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot; &quot; &quot;
whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller arrives in all Europe @-@ League games in the future , Tu@@ ch@@ el left open .
with high probability , he will also contest the second game .
the for@@ tian statement by Mit@@ er Re@@ us that the final move for the BV@@ B in the Europa League should be the goal , mid @-@ field player Julian W@@ eig@@ l considers it comprehensible : &quot; Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I think we have a good chance to access the title . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
Germany should be a technological pioneer in the course of the change of the car according to the will of the German government .
on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt on the ver@@ ge of the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Autom@@ echan@@ IAA &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; of a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; new mobility age . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his counter@@ parts from the G@@ 7 states coming together at the IAA with representatives of the industry .
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid increase in digital radio .
a test track on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government wants to &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and , wherever necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
for example , Germany wants to use internationally to raise the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 kilometers per hour .
the Federal Government also wants to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees people as a driver .
when driving automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more passenger .
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
according to a study submitted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; can only be expected far after 2020 . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the value added in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at the Germany site estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D traffic politi@@ cian S@@ √∂ren Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the driver &apos;s personal data must be clari@@ fied clearly .
however , the German auto @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
a survey commissioned by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday on behalf of the Insp@@ ection Association Dec@@ ra comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail in the coming ten years , 32 percent only reck@@ on in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all .
in France , 21 percent of those surv@@ eyed account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent .
anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; after a survey by the digital ban , Bit@@ kom only seven percent would agree to give control during the entire journey on all roads . &quot; &quot; &quot;
on the motorway , the traffic in flowing traffic could be at least 15 percent , while in the traffic jam 45 percent .
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll tells team and double start at table tennis EM
according to the current state of the title , the D√ºsseldorf Congress wants to open only in single for the title fight from September 25 to October 4 .
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title without Timo , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ coach J√∂rg Ro@@ √ü@@ kopf during the EM course in D√ºsseldorf . &quot; &quot; &quot;
at this time B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsor@@ ship date in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are now no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained individual European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ liste in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also rec@@ alled the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; at that time Timo had been missing , and we have become European champion . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; we should be guided by this , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained the world ranking Fi@@ fth . &quot; &quot; &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on his work in Munich on Wednesday . it is a mixture of a very big fashion show and a wax @-@ figur@@ ine gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins , which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I can no longer say that I am the enf@@ ant terrible of hau@@ te cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; earlier it was ble@@ ached , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from September 18 at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is fortunate that the fashion designer has changed his / her initially dis@@ appro@@ ving attitude towards a show about his person .
&quot; &quot; &quot; actually he was against it , because : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when you die , you get to the museum .
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about as much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is about tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society .
the exhibits give an insight into the work of the man who has written fashion history , without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
chron@@ ologically , the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently choreograph@@ ed Gesamt@@ kunst@@ werk , for which much effort was made : to refurb@@ ish the d@@ olls , for example , a Sty@@ list was hired .
according to the dict@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have had 14 tons of material in Munich .
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leder@@ h@@ osen @-@ outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he is always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot; &quot; &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ √©e alter Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion attempts of the designer .
as a kid ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he dressed his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
his parents wouldn &apos;t have allowed him to play with a doll .
later he taught himself the designing of fashion .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
later I bought them , of course .
for his first own fashion show he couldn &apos;t pay the models .
they got nothing but were allowed to keep the clothes .
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as fashion niche
in the past we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en to make meters .
the embroi@@ dered fabrics and sp@@ ikes were created in a large quantity for customers , which they worked on for example for blankets and she@@ ers .
today , this does not work anymore , &quot; says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of P@@ lau@@ en .
instead , fashion is important again .
in the beginning times of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a major role , was then displaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes .
the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past styli@@ stic periods , is an increasing order potential .
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
with us , they already account for half of all orders .
P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the industry association P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze und Sti@@ cker@@ eien along with nine other companies .
only they can carry the protected label .
over the last 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away .
there is almost no private business and wholesale business .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
today mass @-@ produced goods are made much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains .
in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , up @-@ to @-@ date with Russia and the USA .
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year we have been carrying a seal of quality that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
graduated designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger branch office of the West@@ s√§chs@@ ische Hochschule Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and speci@@ alises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and lace .
to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products .
this takes time and courage .
&quot; &quot; &quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the businesses that need to think particularly economically , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Schmidt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied to maintain a customer base .
a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter revi@@ ved the historic snow@@ ball point .
the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres in some places .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith master@@ in Bianca Hal@@ leb@@ ach @-@ K@@ rau@@ √üe took inspiration from this : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; before that I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
now she uses the tip of the snow for her jewellery .
in a complex process it shapes the pattern in silver .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want to be a souvenir .
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .

it is about the experience of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI insi@@ sts on opening the economy wider for the world
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the economy has to open wide out@@ ward to promote growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said President X@@ i J@@ in@@ ping on Tuesday of a group commissioned to steering the reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group to deep@@ en a comprehensive reform . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said X@@ i . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the management board adopted a number of guidelines , including a list of neg@@ atives for regulating the market access , relaxation of border controls policy , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the resident milking system .
after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment .
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
the initiative is of great importance since it as@@ signs a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guarantees a legally established business environment and open the market more open , &quot; said the statement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the companies and make sure companies decide how to conduct their business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
in the context of an offer to open government controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the ri@@ ght@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors was also discussed at a meeting .
at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double the level of mercury in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large pre@@ dat@@ ory fish and to give consumers a much higher dose of the disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant women and inf@@ ants , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt at F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot; &quot; &quot;
according to Wolf@@ sch@@ midt , the limits of the nerve poison for large fish should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish at the end of the food chain such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish .
however , large pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes are already so strongly poll@@ uted with mercury , that approximately 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches should not be sold on the basis of the still valid limits .
after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ sal@@ eable .
in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values of other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch .
&quot; &quot; &quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; because smaller c@@ emet@@ eries such as car@@ p are usually so low loaded that they already comply with the proposed peak values . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ de defl@@ ection manoeu@@ vre that alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal highly po@@ ison@@ ous for humans , which is heavily accum@@ ul@@ ating over the food chain in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already small amounts can cause &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; damage to the nervous system particularly in the case of un@@ born les@@ ions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , but that a &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; is not expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
mercury enters the environment primarily through the burning of coal .
according to a written information from the German Federal Ministry of Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power plants exp@@ elled more than six tons of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the concentration of mercury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; permanently and nationwide exceeded &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; quoted from paper in March . &quot; &quot; &quot;
last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already counted among the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF .
