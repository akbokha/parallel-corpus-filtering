&quot; &quot; &quot; the term &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the Convention and the Protocol together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning security measures .
the aim of the safegu@@ ards established in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear materials from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explo@@ sives for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rence of such a turn by the risk of early detection .
in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures .
the technical completion of the investigations by the organization takes place by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the amount of material which is not shown for a certain period of time , stating the degree of accuracy for the specified sa@@ ws is specified .
in carrying out their inspections , the organization makes full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3 .
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
in the application of its hed@@ ging measures , the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following species and , if necessary , fores@@ ee how they are more closely determined and useful in the supplementary agreements :
( a ) a measuring system for as@@ cer@@ taining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise from the stock of distant nuclear material and stock quantities ;
B ) the evaluation of reproduci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
C ) determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of tran@@ smit@@ ters and receivers ;
( e ) method for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and not measured losses ;
( F ) a protocol and report system that indicates the core material balance for each material balance zone and the changes in this stock including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ;
( g ) arrangements to ensure that accounting practices and agreements are executed correctly ;
h ) procedures for reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention do not cover material in mining or ore treatment .
B ) Ur@@ an - or th@@ orium @-@ containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in letter c ) , is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ;
C ) Rem@@ oves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is produced , or if this core material or other material produced in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention .
a ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . however , the Community considers that the recovery of core material , which is subject to safegu@@ ards according to this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues , so consult the Organization and the Community on the application of appropriate hed@@ ging measures .
B ) The hed@@ ging measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community realize that this core material is practically non @-@ ref@@ und@@ able .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es the following core material from the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention :
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments ;
B ) Nu@@ clear material when it is used in non nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ cover@@ able , and
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % .
on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to safegu@@ ards under this Convention , from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the entire material quantity freed on account of this article in the States is at no point more than
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special cle@@ av@@ able material , which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
II ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment ,
III ) ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natural ur@@ an@@ ium , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ an@@ ium and depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ an@@ ium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
if delivered core material , together with core material , which is subject to the safegu@@ ards under the provisions of this Convention , is to be processed or stored , precau@@ tions are taken for the re @-@ application of the securing measures on that material .
the Community coinci@@ des with the organisation of Supp@@ le@@ mentary Consum@@ ables required for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention , to determine in detail how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable .
the completion of the agreements may be extended or changed without any modification of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
the organisation , the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements come into force within nin@@ ety days of the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the inclusion of the organization , the community and the states .
on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 , the Organization shall , on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62 , a summari@@ zed inventory of the underlying material in the States , irrespective of its origin , and carry on this Invent@@ ory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their audit reviews .
between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States , Belgium , Denmark , the Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other hand
the EW@@ G decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is imp@@ eded by general resource @-@ cent@@ red problems .
C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement shall be bound and as far as possible within two years after the entry into force is issued in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal .
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the means of funding in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
to this end , the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement -
the Organization shall create a special account under the name &quot; Special Account &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the Special Ac@@ ac@@ tional Account in accordance with this Agreement . ( in this capacity , the Organization is referred to as &quot; Administrator &quot; ) , only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement .
the transaction accounts will be separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic bonds of the member state , which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the relevant state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction bank and to deposit at the establishment of the organisation in the country concerned .
B ) Payment is made in two install@@ ments , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the ste@@ ward agreed upon ;
II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the ste@@ ward , taking into account the deadlines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans .
C ) E@@ ach Member State may make payments prior to the aforementioned dates upon request .
in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes about a proportion@@ ate amount of drawing on the cash or the school j@@ acks in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the transaction accounts in an appropriate manner .
when granting these loans , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC :
III ) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without any reductions ; and
VII ) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
each transaction loan is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly exp@@ and@@ able development programme or proposal ( including a sec@@ toral loan ) , irrespective of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not , according to procedures and practices which are considered , approved and managed for the purpose of the grant of this agreement ( b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement .
the funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Rec@@ on@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the date of entry into force of this agreement .
in addition to Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same re@@ payment conditions , which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the Organisation ; therefore , they are re@@ payable in 50 years at a rate of ten years .
promotional loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts to pay for this security watch are to be paid directly to the organization that it retains .
each special transaction is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the bene@@ fici@@ ary country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the funds is in particular given .
the recei@@ pts from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which , in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of granting loans , may be bene@@ fici@@ aries of a special transaction loan .
capital re@@ payments of special transaction loans are transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount ref@@ unded in the currency of a member state shall be transferred from the ste@@ ward to the Member State at its receipt as soon as possible .
the Administrator is responsible for the complete publication of all the special transaction loans made by the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors .
during the time of payment of the special transaction loans , the administrator informs the EEC four times a year about the development of the special transaction loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this .
as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the Organisation , the Administrator communic@@ ates a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organisation at the end of the statement .
after full payment of the transaction loans , the administrator of the EEC shall report as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account .
the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , the amounts to be paid from the account , the amounts paid to the account and the withdraw@@ als paid to the member states .
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ wards until the full issue of the funds of the Special Ac@@ ac@@ tional Account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas on the state of the special transaction bank , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action bodies , and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement .
if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later time , which the EEC and the Organisation may agree on , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from are due immediately .
if the total capital amount of all the bene@@ fici@@ aries claimed by the bene@@ fici@@ aries is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and re@@ mitted to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting there@@ from shall be terminated with immediate effect .
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the Member States &apos; governments stipul@@ ate the termination of the procedures concerned to the Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ retariat passes these noti@@ fications along with a notification of the proper approval of this Agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
this agreement becomes effective and comes into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
this agreement is written in two scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , whereby any wording is equally binding .
whereas the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a correspondence to the amend@@ ment of the An@@ nex A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ T issued the following UN@@ CL@@ ING :

in order to simplify the procedure for the adaptation of customs tari@@ ffs in the event of renewed changes to the customs tari@@ ff of one of the contracting parties in the future , it also appears that an article 12 must be included in the agreement .
I honor you to confirm the consent of the Community to these changes , and suggest you as an appointment for entry into force 1 . January 1978 .
I would be grateful if you confirmed the approval of your government to the above .
I honor you to confirm the entrance of your present letter with the following wording :
&quot; &quot; &quot; I would be grateful if you would confirm the approval of your government to the above . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
agreement in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the medium @-@ term financial contribution
the BI@@ S could close stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries , if the banks submit a corresponding request .
the agreements may be closed up to the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor land to the mechanism , within an overall limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 Bil@@ lion units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery fund of the member countries .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready for its application . &quot; &quot; &quot;
with every stand @-@ by credit , the BI@@ S would first assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without the fact that a total of five years will be exceeded .
at the opening of the loans as well as for their possible extension , the BI@@ S would charge a credit opening commission .
in addition , the first drawing should not be made prior to the end of one month after conclusion of the Stand@@ by agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments of its own liquidity .
the drawing would take place in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods that would be taken into account the funds of the Bank , presumably three or six months .
the conditions would correspond to those used by the BI@@ S under similar conditions at the time , i.e. the interest rates would largely correspond to market rates .

I am referring to the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations on the establishment of provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are agreed as follows :
- fresh or frozen chicken - , lamb and goat meat ( collective bar@@ gaining agency 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff ) ;
- frozen H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( collective bar@@ gaining authority 02.@@ 01 A IV b ) of the Common Cust@@ oms Tari@@ ff .
as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay are determined according to the Community at the following annual amount :
in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Uruguay is committed to ensuring that the quantity of the year is not exceeding the agreed quantity and is carried out in accordance with the traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
should a change in the offer form be made as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution .
in the event that the Community takes the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the Urugu@@ ay@@ an access to the joint market is not affected by this agreement .
in the event that imports from Uruguay in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Uruguay for the rest of the year .
the Community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to the import of the products collected by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em .
in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Uruguay is changing the quantity set by number 2 corresponding to the extent of ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an commerce with every new Member State .
import restrictions for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; this shall take into account the ho@@ ech@@ st set of exhaus@@ tion mentioned in number 5 .
the total volume mentioned under number 2 is determined by the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the community to 5 800 tons of car@@ c@@ ass weight .
the community under@@ takes everything in order to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the community market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; in particular , the Community takes precau@@ tions so that the sale of stock of intervention on frozen meat is not under@@ min@@ ed due to the implementation of the Regulation on ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other promotion measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as of slaugh@@ tering certain living sheep and lambs will only take place at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products .
these terms are to be interpreted in a way compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agre@@ ements .
in particular , Uruguay ensures compliance with this agreement , in particular by the fact that the quantities specified in this Agreement are subject to export lic@@ ences for the products listed under number 1 .
the Community comm@@ its itself to take all necessary precau@@ tions so that the distribution of import lic@@ ences for the above @-@ mentioned products with origin in Uruguay is dependent on the submission of an export licence , which is granted by the competent authority designated by the Urugu@@ ay@@ an government .
in implementing provisions , it is also specified that the responsible ur@@ u@@ gu@@ ay@@ an authority of the responsible body of the community in regular intervals sends the quantities , for which export lic@@ ences have been issued ; these details may be deco@@ ded according to destination country .
this agreement applies to the areas in which the Treaty is applied to establish the European Economic Community , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Uruguay on the other hand .
it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year .
in any event , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by the two parties before 1 April 1984 in terms of changes they deemed necessary .
I would be grateful if you would confirm your government &apos;s approval with this letter .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations for the consolidation of the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Uruguay into the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat through the Community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are agreed as follows : &quot; &quot; &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing an@@ tigen which is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or any other substance on the label .
if a re@@ agent is used in the manner recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not appear : a ) Hem@@ oly@@ tic characteristics ;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeated di@@ lution of the agent to be examined onto the double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest serum di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; di@@ lution is calculated only by volume of the blood @-@ body in@@ undation in the total volume .
in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier .
the World Health Organisation has established international standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B , as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time standards .
according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters that are observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) .

&quot; &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; consistency &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; paper serves as an application or paper for ex@@ port@@ ation , shipping or import . &quot; &quot; &quot;
- to carry out legal regulations in force in force of a contracting party whose application is not guaranteed with the sole use of the single unit ;
- to be required by the parties concerned so that they may be able to come to the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief at the request .
( 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for those involved .
( 2 ) Simp@@ le procedures may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned do not exhibit at a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete registration may be permitted .
in these cases , an application must subsequently be filed , with the consent of the competent authorities for a periodi@@ c registration of a collective agreement to be submitted within the period set by these authorities .
in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use rather than the single entry paper .
if the consistency paper is used , the parties concerned with the consent of the competent authorities may join the general lists in which the goods are described , instead of the supplements relating to imports and imports , instead of the supplementary sheets to the consistency explan@@ atory paper .
- to conclude agreements or agreements with regard to further simpli@@ fication of the form@@ alities for their entire goods traffic or for sub @-@ areas ;
- in case of con@@ sign@@ ments which include several types of goods , in order to use the disp@@ at@@ chers in the shipping method store lists instead of the supplementary sheets for consistency paper ;
- to allow applications to be created , if necessary , by means of public or private data processing plants according to the conditions set by the relevant authorities ;
- to allow the competent authorities to request the data necessary for the fulfillment of the respective form@@ alities in their data processing systems for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , and , if necessary , without giving a written notification ;
- to allow the competent authorities in case of the use of a data processing system for the treatment of the registr@@ ations , that the export , shipping or import registration can be done either by the Single paper or , if such a paper is not created , by entering the data into the data processing plant ;
- To apply any facil@@ itation adopted by the Mi@@ xed Committee in the course of a resolution pursuant to Article 11 , paragraph 3 .
( 1 ) The provisions on the provision of the forms required for ex@@ port@@ ation , shipping and import@@ ation of goods by means of the single unit are laid down in App@@ endi@@ x II to this Convention .
( 2 ) The common codes , which are to be used in the forms listed in App@@ endi@@ x I , are to be found in An@@ nex III to this Convention .

( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions of con@@ sign@@ ments , the relevant authorities can , however , fores@@ ee that the form@@ alities for the export and the shipping method must be transferred to one and the same pre @-@ printed form by means of the copies prescribed for these form@@ ulations .
in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities are as far as possible that the information contained in the individual proceedings contained in the individual proceedings is identical .
( 1 ) In order to ensure a smooth exchange of goods between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the Cust@@ oms authorities of these countries are looking for or - if they are interested in a different contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports )
( 2 ) The official aid may be refused or refused if the sought @-@ out country considers that the bai@@ li@@ ff would violate his security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or violate any operational , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y .
( 3 ) In the case of refusal or refusal of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its grounds for the Land @-@ seeking state shall be communicated in@@ vari@@ ably .
