<seg id="695">The purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied in the implementation of the provisions of Part I concerning security measures.</seg>
<seg id="696">The aim of the safeguards established in this Convention is the timely detection of the branching of significant quantities of nuclear materials from peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear explosives for unknown purposes, as well as the deterrence of such a turn by the risk of early detection.</seg>
<seg id="697">In order to reach the target specified in Article 28, the material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance, combined with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures.</seg>
<seg id="698">The technical completion of the investigations by the organization takes place by an explanation in which for each material balance zone the amount of material which is not shown for a certain period of time, stating the degree of accuracy for the specified saws is specified.</seg>
<seg id="699">In carrying out their inspections, the organization makes full use of the security system of the Community in accordance with Article 3.</seg>
<seg id="700">The accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones.</seg>
<seg id="701">In the application of its hedging measures, the Community of de procedures and measures will make use of the following species and, if necessary, foresee how they are more closely determined and useful in the supplementary agreements:</seg>
<seg id="702">(a) a measuring system for ascertaining the quantities of preserved, produced, lost, lost or otherwise from the stock of distant nuclear material and stock quantities;</seg>
<seg id="703">B) the evaluation of reproducibility and accuracy of measurements and estimation of measurement uncertainty;</seg>

<seg id="707">(g) arrangements to ensure that accounting practices and agreements are executed correctly;</seg>
<seg id="708">H) procedures for reimbursement of reports to the organization in line with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69.</seg>
<seg id="709">The safeguards according to this Convention do not cover material in mining or ore treatment.</seg>
<seg id="710">B) Uran - or thorium-containing material, which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described in letter c), is introduced into the states, so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material, unless it is introduced for specific non-nuclear purposes;</seg>
<seg id="711">C) Removes core material, which is suitable for the composition and purity of fuel production or isotope enrichment, the plant or the process phase in which it is produced, or if this core material or other material produced in a later stage of the nuclear fuel cycle is introduced into the states, so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention.</seg>
<seg id="712">A) The hedging measures envisaged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11. however, the Community considers that the recovery of core material, which is subject to safeguards according to this Convention, is temporarily not possible or desirable from residues, so consult the Organization and the Community on the application of appropriate hedging measures.</seg>
<seg id="713">B) The hedging measures envisaged in this Convention are terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 13, provided that the organization and the community realize that this core material is practically non-refundable.</seg>
<seg id="714">On request of the Community, the organization frees the following core material from the safeguards according to this Convention:</seg>
<seg id="715">A) special fissile material when used in grams or smaller amounts as a sensor in instruments;</seg>
<seg id="716">B) Nuclear material when it is used in non nuclear activities in accordance with Article 13, if such core material is recoverable, and</seg>
<seg id="717">C) Plutonium with isotope concentration of plutonium-238, which is over 80%.</seg>
<seg id="718">On request of the Community, the organization frees core material, which would otherwise be subject to safeguards under this Convention, from these safeguards, provided that the entire material quantity freed on account of this article in the States is at no point more than</seg>
<seg id="719">A) a total of one kilogram of special cleavable material, which can consist of one or more of the following materials:</seg>
<seg id="720">II) uranium with an enrichment of 0.2 (20%) and above, calculated by multiplication of its weight with enrichment,</seg>
<seg id="721">III) uranium with an enrichment that lies under 0.2 (20%) and above that of natural uranium, calculated by multiplication of its weight with the five-fold square of enrichment;</seg>
<seg id="722">B) a total of ten metric tons of natural uranium and depleted uranium with an enrichment of more than 0.005 (0.5%);</seg>
<seg id="723">C) twenty metric tons of depleted uranium with an enrichment of 0.005 (0.5%) or below;</seg>
<seg id="724">If delivered core material, together with core material, which is subject to the safeguards under the provisions of this Convention, is to be processed or stored, precautions are taken for the re-application of the securing measures on that material.</seg>
<seg id="725">The Community coincides with the organisation of Supplementary Consumables required for the successful and effective fulfillment of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention, to determine in detail how the procedures established in the Convention are applicable.</seg>
<seg id="726">The completion of the agreements may be extended or changed without any modification of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community.</seg>
<seg id="727">The organisation, the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements come into force within ninety days of the entry into force of this agreement; an extension of this period requires the inclusion of the organization, the community and the states.</seg>
<seg id="728">On the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62, the Organization shall, on the basis of the initial report stated in Article 62, a summarized inventory of the underlying material in the States, irrespective of its origin, and carry on this Inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of their audit reviews.</seg>
<seg id="729">Between the European Economic Community (EEC) and its Member States, Belgium, Denmark, the Federal Republic of Germany, France, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom (Member States) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation (Organisation) on the other hand</seg>
<seg id="730">The EWG decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income, whose development is impeded by general resource-centred problems.</seg>
<seg id="731">C) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the contribution made by the Member States within six months of entry into force of the agreement shall be bound and as far as possible within two years after the entry into force is issued in the form of loans, and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal.</seg>
<seg id="732">D) The EEC and the Organisation have consulted one another about the proposed implementation and administration of this agreement and the means of funding in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="733">To this end, the organization of the EEC has presented a table showing how it intends to apply the criteria established in this agreement -</seg>
<seg id="734">The Organization shall create a special account under the name "Special Account" which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the Special Acactional Account in accordance with this Agreement. (in this capacity, the Organization is referred to as "Administrator"), only to the purpose specified in this Agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="735">The transaction accounts will be separately and separately managed by all other accounts and assets of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="736">The contributions are to be paid as follows: a) Payment is made in the form of cash or intrinsic bonds of the member state, which are to be paid upon request in the currency of the relevant state at the order of the organization as the administrator of the special transaction bank and to deposit at the establishment of the organisation in the country concerned.</seg>
<seg id="737">B) Payment is made in two installments, namely i) the first in the amount of at least 45 v. h. the contribution within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the steward agreed upon;</seg>
<seg id="738">II) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time agreed between the EEC and the steward, taking into account the deadlines necessary for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans.</seg>
<seg id="739">C) Each Member State may make payments prior to the aforementioned dates upon request.</seg>
<seg id="740">In accordance with the usual procedures of the organization, the administrator takes about a proportionate amount of drawing on the cash or the school jacks in order to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to balance the transaction accounts in an appropriate manner.</seg>
<seg id="741">When granting these loans, the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC:</seg>
<seg id="742">III) the extent to which international economic factors have contributed to the current and foreseeable economic problems of the country;</seg>
<seg id="743">VI) of the composition and the tendency of the country's debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without any reductions; and</seg>
<seg id="744">VII) to the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources.</seg>
<seg id="745">Each transaction loan is intended to finance a clearly defined and rapidly expandable development programme or proposal (including a sectoral loan), irrespective of whether it belongs to the loan programme of the organization or not, according to procedures and practices which are considered, approved and managed for the purpose of the grant of this agreement (b) of the preamble to this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="746">The funds of the special transaction account must not be used instead of ordinary funds of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Bank) or the Organization, which are bound by a loan or credit for a program or project that has already been approved by the Bank's directors or the organization on the date of entry into force of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="747">In addition to Section 4, special transaction loans are subject to the same repayment conditions, which are generally applicable to the development loans granted by the Organisation; therefore, they are repayable in 50 years at a rate of ten years.</seg>
<seg id="748">Promotional loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are repayable in these currencies.</seg>
<seg id="749">Amounts to pay for this security watch are to be paid directly to the organization that it retains.</seg>
<seg id="750">Each special transaction is indicated by a separate loan agreement between the beneficiary country and the caretaker, in which the origin of the funds is in particular given.</seg>
<seg id="751">The receipts from each transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or produced in a Member State; ii) in developing countries which are members of the organization and which, in accordance with what the administrator has set at the time of granting loans, may be beneficiaries of a special transaction loan.</seg>
<seg id="752">Capital repayments of special transaction loans are transferred to the special transaction account, and the amount refunded in the currency of a member state shall be transferred from the steward to the Member State at its receipt as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="753">The Administrator is responsible for the complete publication of all the special transaction loans made by the EEC concerning the plans and programmes approved by the directors in preparation for the audit by the directors.</seg>
<seg id="754">During the time of payment of the special transaction loans, the administrator informs the EEC four times a year about the development of the special transaction loans and the expenditures made for this.</seg>
<seg id="755">As soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the Organisation, the Administrator communicates a detailed account of the special transaction account with a statement from the external auditor of the organisation at the end of the statement.</seg>
<seg id="756">After full payment of the transaction loans, the administrator of the EEC shall report as soon as possible a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account.</seg>
<seg id="757">The administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account, the amounts to be paid from the account, the amounts paid to the account and the withdrawals paid to the member states.</seg>
<seg id="758">The EEC and the caretakers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="759">To this end, the EEC (represented by the Commission of the European Communities) and the stewards until the full issue of the funds of the Special Acactional Account from time to time lead to an exchange of ideas on the state of the special transaction bank, the progress of programmes or projects financed by special action bodies, and on all other issues relating to the provisions of this agreement.</seg>
<seg id="760">If this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later time, which the EEC and the Organisation may agree on, the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting therefrom are due immediately.</seg>
