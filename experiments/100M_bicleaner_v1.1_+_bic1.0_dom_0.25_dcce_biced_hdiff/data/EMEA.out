it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of enam@@ el tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) .
B. wir@@ h thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance , a mental illness , in which patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal up@@ swing ) alternating with periods of normal temper@@ ament .
abili@@ fy is used to treat severe to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick monitoring of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when oral consumption of the medication is not possible .
in both diseases , the solution can be used for insertion or melting tablets in patients who are experiencing difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets .
in patients who take other medicines at the same time as they are broken down like Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is probably mainly known as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this means that , like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts as the neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter to activate the recept@@ ors .
since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole helps to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thereby reducing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence .
the efficacy of abili@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year .
the effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies with 80@@ 5 patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased un@@ rest over a period of two hours with a placebo .
in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over 12 weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence , to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with abili@@ fy .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that suffered from increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
in all studies the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and absor@@ bs ( absor@@ bs ) the solution .
in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received abili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg gave a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving a placebo .
in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder Abi@@ li@@ fy reduced man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of five short @-@ term studies .
in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented more effective than placebo for recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
abili@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo experienced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
the most common side effects of abili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , ath@@ lete ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( drow@@ sin@@ ess ) , drow@@ sin@@ ess ( nausea ) , ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and of medium to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who predominantly spoke of man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus the risks .
in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate , compared to the risks .
in June 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . approval for the marketing of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the European Union .
abili@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals .
increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
efficacy of abili@@ fy in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors warrant this ( see section 4.4 ) .
if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ duc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) .
the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic disorders and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after a change of an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , even in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hypo@@ sta@@ sis , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ er@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia are observed in a patient treated with abili@@ fy , it should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment .
if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a M@@ NS , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of M@@ NS , all anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including abili@@ fy , must be dis@@ continued .
this is why Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es .
56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psycho@@ sis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease had an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo .
however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including abili@@ fy .
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related adverse events associated with abili@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ thi@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients suffering from diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles lead to serious complications .
due to the primary effect of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is required if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ oti@@ dine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ ption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant .
in a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be performed .
in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) Met@@ abol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 Exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ isers .
considering the common gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient .
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be performed .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose amount before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or es@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be dos@@ ed together with a moderate increase in Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ strates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ in@@ an @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ met@@ amorph@@ an ) .
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are pregnant during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
this drug may not be used in pregnancy because of insufficient data protection for humans and because of the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies , unless the potential use justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fo@@ etus .
however , as with other anti @-@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned of using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on them .
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
the frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total decreased incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred in patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and 15.@@ 1 % in patients with os@@ el@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 23.@@ 5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hal@@ operi@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups among Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects reported in connection with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and the incidence of the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or inten@@ tional over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths .
although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of over@@ dose because Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole exhibits high plasma retention .
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial antagon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ recept@@ ors is medi@@ ated .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ A and 5@@ HT@@ 2a @-@ receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4 , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2 and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and to the hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor .
in dos@@ ages of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers , posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at the nucle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ test .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients enrolled in the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ mine depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se was seen for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ vi@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients have a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superi@@ ority to placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed no superior efficacy against placebo .
in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo , comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 .
in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a similar percentage of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia in week 12 , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not apply to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term extension phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole prior to random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
based on in vitro studies the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ yl@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N de@@ al@@ ky@@ lam@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 .
the mean Eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on extensive metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and approximately 146 hours in &apos; poor &apos; ( = &apos; poor &apos; ) metabol@@ ites via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy volunteers , as did a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic examination of schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients no sex @-@ related effects .
a specific analysis of the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics showed no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity .
based on conventional studies on safety disease , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data had no particular dangers for human beings .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans , so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ x of the mean @-@ time @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate from Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found no more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the g@@ all of apes , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of the in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11@@ x of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

in an O@@ vi@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients have a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
97 Dur@@ ing a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trial for 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I dis@@ ruption , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole did not show superior efficacy against placebo .
in a relative bio @-@ availability study comparing the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in tablet form in healthy volunteers , the ratio between the geometric C@@ max average value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) .
99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites by Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean Ste@@ ady State exposition ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11@@ x of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .
abili@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control det@@ achment and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder when oral therapy is not appropriate .
once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution and commen@@ ced with the oral application of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in order to increase the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize vari@@ ability , an injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the Glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by b@@ yp@@ assing obes@@ e regions .
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the drug used for maintenance or ac@@ utely therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
if a further oral treatment with Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is indicated , see the summary of the features of the drug to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy melting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution .
there are no studies on the effectiveness of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution in patients with ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders caused by schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ a pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution , patients should be observed with regard to extreme se@@ dation or a blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) .
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal drugs ) .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hypo@@ sta@@ sis , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hypertension ( including cel@@ er@@ ated and malign@@ ant form ) .
Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials that lasted a year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
clinical manifestations of a M@@ NS are high fever , muscle stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and irregular heart@@ beat ) .
poly@@ thi@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients suffering from diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be regularly monitored regarding a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels .
weight gain is generally observed in schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles lead to serious complications .

other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be performed .
after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dose amount before the start of the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy .

107 The following side effects were more likely to occur ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials with oral applied Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) :
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS was 26.@@ 6 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS was 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
a comparison between the patient groups among Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo , in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medi@@ cally significant differences .
increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo .
side effects related to an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and also reported during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) .
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances was the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant major improvements of ag@@ ility / behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of ag@@ ility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ a@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
the medi@@ an improvement of the initial value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ ility , a similar effectiveness in relation to the population population was observed , but a statistical significance could be observed due to a reduced number of patients .
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed statisti@@ cally significant improvement in psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ der patients enrolled in the study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) .
current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg depression rate , showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia , a significantly higher reduction in the rate of rel@@ ap@@ se was observed for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) , which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) group and at 57 % below placebo .
in an O@@ vi@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multinational double blind study with schi@@ z@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study objective was &apos; weight gain &apos; , significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca .
111 In a placebo @-@ controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some cases did not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ ate .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension in man@@ ic patients who achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar disorder , mainly in the prevention of a rel@@ ap@@ se into the man@@ ia .
in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection , the AU@@ C Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 90 % larger than the AU@@ C after having received the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
in 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was 1 to 3 hours after the maximum plasma level reached .
the administration of Ari@@ ad@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which was 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscul@@ arly .
in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application there was no safety concern after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg .
based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for safety disease , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , reproduction toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data could not identify any particular dangers for human beings .
toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans ; therefore , they have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( 10 times the average steady @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
in addition , a ch@@ ol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was observed as a result of the precip@@ itation of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the mean steady @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) .
in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , leading to expos@@ ures of 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose .

the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study involving 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters previously had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine .
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
overall , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were treated to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients receiving conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
considering only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival .
on the other hand , in patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer , they showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medication .
it should not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood before treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) found that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing medicines and that in contrast to other medications contained in pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
in January 2008 , the European Commission granted Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited to the company Abra@@ x@@ ane in the European Union .
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not indicated for standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series .
in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to Grade 1 or 2 , and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced .
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there is currently no sufficient data to recommend dose adaptation in patients with impairment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to lack of data for safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is a alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ article formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el that could have significantly different pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be stopped immediately and a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment is initiated , and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in the patients no renewed Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils increase again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver function disorders ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
while a cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac incidents in the inde@@ xed patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease .
if there is nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in the patients after the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is unavoid@@ able .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane are advised to not give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment .
male patients should be advised of a sperm retention before the treatment , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect the transport ability and the ability to operate machinery .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly reversible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the dosage of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) .
occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ or@@ ous in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart disease :

pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , neck pain , abdominal pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , neck pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness very common :
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in the case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
as these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events has been established .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an An@@ tim@@ il@@ ot@@ ub@@ ules active ingredient that promotes the storage of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their dep@@ oly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ in medi@@ ates the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into endo@@ theli@@ al cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
it is assumed that this improved tran@@ sen@@ do@@ theli@@ al transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 alb@@ um@@ an receptor and a pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el accumulation in the area of the tumour due to the alb@@ um@@ binding protein SP@@ ARC ( f@@ lar@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) .
the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast carcin@@ oma is supported by data from 106 patients in two one @-@ arm un@@ linked studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
in a study , 43 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion for over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 m@@ g. / m2 .
in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma .
this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el every 3 weeks , either in the form of a solution containing adju@@ v@@ ant pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre @-@ medication ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases .
14 % of patients had previously received chemotherapy , 27 % had adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only for metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment .
9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients who receive first @-@ line therapy are presented below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients experiencing a peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay in bas@@ eline due to the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of the total Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials .
the Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure Ex@@ pos@@ ure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g.@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 After the intraven@@ ous dosage of Abra@@ x@@ ane to patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the plasma @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el plasma concentration decreased in multi@@ phase mode .
the medium distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume indicates far @-@ reaching extra @-@ vascular distribution and / or soft binding of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared to intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher after the Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Gabe ( 43 % ) than after a solution @-@ containing Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) .
in published literature on in vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers , pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ xy@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) .
after a 30 minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast carcin@@ oma , the mean value was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the total dose of 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which indicates far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance .
however , only a few data is available for patients at the age of over 75 , as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis .
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution is inj@@ ected into an Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ flow @-@ bottle over a period of at least 1 minute ( 0.@@ 9 % ) .
after complete application of the solution , the bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wet@@ ting of the solid .
then the bottle should be slowly and carefully swi@@ v@@ elled and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes until complete res@@ us@@ suspension of the powder is performed .
if precip@@ itation or sin@@ king substances are visible , the water bottle must again be gently inver@@ ted in order to achieve complete res@@ us@@ suspension prior to the application .
the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and the corresponding amount of the re@@ formed Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PV@@ C@@ - or non @-@ PVC in@@ fusion bag .

Abra@@ x@@ ane is used to treat breast cancer when other therapies have been tried , but not successful , and if you do not question anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapies .
Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be applied : • If you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el or any of the other components of Abra@@ x@@ ane , if you breast@@ feed • If your white blood cells are degra@@ ded ( initial values for neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils of &lt; 1.5 x 109 / l - your doctor will inform you )
special caution when using Abra@@ x@@ ane is required : • If you have a impaired kidney function • if you suffer from num@@ b@@ ness , ting@@ ling , ting@@ ling sensation , touch sensitivity or muscle weakness , if you suffer from severe liver problems • if you have heart problems
if you are using Abra@@ x@@ ane with other medicines , please inform the doctor if you have used other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription medicine , since these might cause an interaction with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
in addition , before the treatment , they should be advised about a sperm retention , because through the Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment the possibility of permanent in@@ fertility exists .
ma@@ dness and handling of machinery Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as fatigue ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the transport ability and the ability to operate machinery .
if you also receive other medicines as part of your treatment , you should consult your doctor regarding driving or serving machines .

if it is not immediately used , it can be stored in the bottle for up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) , when stored in the cardboard box to protect the contents from light .
every bottle contains 100 mg of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . • After the re@@ constitution every ml of the suspension contains 5 mg of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . • The other component is alb@@ um@@ ance from man ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) )
precau@@ tions for the preparation and use of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic medicine and , as with other potentially toxic substances , should be treated with caution when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe , should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into an Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ flow @-@ bottle .
then move the bottle for at least 2 minutes slowly and carefully and / or in@@ vert until a complete res@@ us@@ board of the powder is performed .

member states must ensure that the holder of the authorisation for placing on the market prior to the market launch provides medical personnel in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail stores with the following information and materials :
• Training brochure • Sum@@ mary of the characteristics of the medicine ( technical information ) , labelling and packaging material . • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product , cooling boxes for transport by the patients .
this means that se@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
patients with normal blood vessels are used in which complications may occur in connection with blood trans@@ fusion , if a blood loss is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected .
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood don@@ ors , ab@@ se@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein .
the injection can also be performed by the patient or his car@@ egi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate instructions .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) .
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment .
in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ tic deficiency , or that the body does not adequately address the body &apos;s er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
ab@@ se@@ amed was compared to the reference drug when administered as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems .
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected at least eight weeks of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o before they were either converted to se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin @-@ inj@@ ected ab@@ se@@ amed were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
in the study of patients suffering from kidney problems , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were re@@ amed to se@@ amed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl .
the most common side effect of ab@@ se@@ amed is a rise in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ el@@ ly mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion .
ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other components .
ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for se@@ amed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the company , which has amed down amed , will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States , including information on the safety of the medicine .
in August 2007 , the European Commission granted approval to the company Medi@@ ce medicinal P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG for placing of se@@ amed across the European Union .
treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of trans@@ fusion requirements in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( e.g. cardiovascular status , pre@@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) .
the treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6,@@ 2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger operational procedures which require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units of blood in women ; 5 or more units of blood in men ) .
for the reduction of external blood , ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied before a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications can be expected .
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml may not be applied to an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , except for pedi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex and overall disease ; therefore , the physician is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of the disease .
a rise in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can occasionally be observed over or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose can be reduced by 25 % .
patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest approved dose , which is necessary for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and the symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than those in which initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4,@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than those with initial an@@ a@@ emia which is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) .
symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia and - sequ@@ el@@ ae may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease ; therefore , the physician &apos;s assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary .
given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
patients should be closely monitored to ensure epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used at the lowest approved dose which is necessary for controlling the symptoms of an@@ a@@ emia .
if after 4 weeks of treatment the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has risen by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose of 150 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ E. / kg once a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l is increased compared to the initial value , the dose should be raised to 300 I.@@ E. / kg three times a week .
if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ E. / kg the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the number of re@@ tic@@ ation is ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg should be maintained three times a week .
if the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value has risen by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , an approach to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken off .
patients with mild an@@ emia ( hem@@ ato@@ cri@@ t 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ fo@@ ils is required , in a dose of 600 I.@@ E. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery .
iron sub@@ stitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - to provide large iron reserves before the start of the se@@ amed treatment .
6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa which should be given once weekly for three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be given pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ E. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards .
alternatively injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml of is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation .
patients suffering from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ con@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) under treatment with any er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin should not receive a se@@ amed or other er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ p@@ ie ) .
heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. ven@@ ous ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery and who cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in the following pre@@ - , accompanying or underlying diseases : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ a or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event .
er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ con@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an an@@ tigen @-@ medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
in patients with sudden loss of function , defined as reduction of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the re@@ tic@@ ation value should be determined and the usual causes for a failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium oxidation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) should be investigated .
if the rep@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the re@@ tic@@ ut@@ ural &quot; index &quot; ) , is degra@@ ded ( &lt; 20.000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 20.000 / micro@@ liter or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers are normal , and if no other cause of an active loss is found , the anti @-@ er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA should be considered .
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an@@ emia @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 In case of patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration , recommended under Section 4.2 , should not be exceeded .
clinical trials witnessed an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events when er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ic @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of more than 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the ability of epo@@ et@@ ins when the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the increase in ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should be about 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure .
in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration , recommended under Section 4.2 , should not be exceeded .
according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
in tumour patients with chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the treatment efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients who may have to be trans@@ f@@ used ) .
if the H@@ b increase is greater than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) a month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic events ( see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ins should be based on benefit @-@ risk weighing involving the patient &apos;s involvement , which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
patients who are supposed to undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should , if possible , investigate the cause of an@@ a@@ emia prior to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa therapy .
patients undergoing a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis pro@@ phyla@@ xis , since they have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in case of underlying cardiovascular disease .
in addition , it is not possible for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa to have an increased risk of postoperative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with an initial am@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of &gt; 13 g / dl .
in several controlled studies , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia .
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was targeted
if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adapted to the rising ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t .
in vitro studies on tumor tissues do not result in an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .
th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ em@@ ics , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ cts , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s , ret@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ oses , and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys has been reported in patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension .
increased incidence of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
regardless of er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease can result in th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications after repeated blood donations .
the genetic engineering of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ates and is identical with the endo@@ genous human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in relation to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate content , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ aesthetic patients .
with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells it could be shown that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates the er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis .

survival and progression of tumour progression were studied in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the control patients .
in these studies , patients with an an@@ a@@ emia treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality rate compared to the controls in combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ oses and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients and at controls satisfactory .
there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumor patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and a negative effect on overall survival cannot be ruled out .
it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of achieving a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , as too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data .
epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa drugs after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly prolonged half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than serum levels achieved after intraven@@ ous injection .
there is no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift .
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be caused by a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
in a study of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared with the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
14 In animal studies with approximately 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ec@@ tal body weight , to a delay of the oscill@@ ation and to a rise in fet@@ al mortality .

the owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that the drug vig@@ il@@ ance system described in version 3.0 and implemented in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorization application is set up and functioning before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the medicine marketed in the transport is applied .
the owner of the marketing authorization is obliged to carry out the studies and additional measures listed in the pharmac@@ o@@ vig@@ il@@ ance plan , as described in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) listed in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. of the authorisation application , as well as to carry out the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP .
an updated R@@ MP should be provided at the same time with the next updated report on the harm@@ lessness of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) in accordance with the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human Use .
in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be filed : • with the receipt of new information that may affect the current safety specification , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance plan or the risk reduction measures • mil@@ estones within 60 days of reaching an important milestone ( by request by the E@@ MEA )
• If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke in a month prior to your treatment , if you suffer from unstable Ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time occurring or increased chest pain ) , there is a risk of drop@@ let formation in veins ( deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis ) - if , for example , such a drop of blood has occ@@ ured earlier
you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervi@@ cal vessels ( vascular disease of the car@@ oti@@ des ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) you recently had a heart attack or stroke .
during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood plat@@ ch@@ ets , which re@@ produces during further treatment .
your doctor may , if necessary , perform regular blood tests to regularly control the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( ha@@ em@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed before the therapy begins .
very rare was reported on the occurrence of an an@@ thro@@ po@@ bla@@ con@@ ia @-@ medi@@ ated er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spec@@ kled ) er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
if you suffer from er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ con@@ ia , it will ab@@ ort your treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated .
therefore , ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated because of an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
a high level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in is the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of death could be increased .
in case of increased or increasing levels of potassium , your doctor can contem@@ plate an interruption of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium levels are in the normal range .
if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or st@@ ow@@ age due to insufficient heart rate , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value .
at present , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and the desired effect should be considered for ass@@ essing the efficacy of se@@ amed amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your red blood pigment levels ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of drop@@ let formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( adi@@ p@@ ous ) or if in the past th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events occurred ( e.g. a deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) .
if you are a cancer patient , consider that se@@ amed seems to be a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can neg@@ atively affect the tumour .
if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , ab@@ se@@ amed should examine and treat the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia before treatment .
if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive the amed amed , as there is an increased risk of blood cl@@ ots after surgery .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / use other medicines or have taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
if you are using C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ sen@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
laboratory tests have not shown interactions between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are the means of building the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) .
depending on how your an@@ a@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until your condition is under control .
your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the treatment outcome and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
once you are well tuned , you will receive regular doses of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large inj@@ ections .
your doctor will , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the outcome of your treatment and ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value .
depending on how the an@@ a@@ emia responds to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted about every four weeks until the condition is under control .
in order to ensure this and ensure that the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the attending physician will perform regular blood tests .
if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ E. / kg can be given on 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of surgery and another 4 days after surgery .
however , if your doctor holds this for appropriate , you can also learn how to inj@@ ure ab@@ se@@ amed yourself under the skin .
heart , heart attacks , cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , stroke , transi@@ ent circul@@ atory disorders of the brain , deep vein th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis , vascular diseases ( an@@ eur@@ y@@ sm@@ s ) , thro@@ mb@@ oses of the retina and blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys were reported in patients with er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment .

er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ y means that no longer enough red blood cells can be formed in the bone mar@@ row ( see section &quot; Special caution when using ab@@ se@@ amed is required &quot; ) .
after repeated blood donations , it can happen - regardless of the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed - to a blood drop formation ( th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) .
treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed may be associated with increased risk of blood sample generation after surgery ( post @-@ operative th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic vascular events ) if your starting point is too high

Ac@@ la@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : • Oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes bones br@@ ittle ) both in women after menop@@ ause and in men .
it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently undergone a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture like the h@@ ind ; • Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth .
in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ tures should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) or@@ ally or by injection into a muscle before the first in@@ fusion .
the administration of acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after the in@@ fusion such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headache .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
since the active substance in Ac@@ la@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate Ac@@ la@@ sta .
the first study included almost 8 000 elderly women with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was studied over a period of three years .
the second study included 2 127 male and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures was studied over a period of up to five years .
in the case of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with the ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months .
the main indicator of effectiveness was whether the content of the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that de@@ compos@@ es bone substance ) in the blood once again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the initial value .
in the study of older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( without oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients .
compared to all patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis therapies ) with those taking placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures reduced by 41 % .
in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under Ac@@ la@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients taking placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
Ac@@ la@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients at Ac@@ la@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( the death of bone tissue ) in the jaw .
Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s manufacturer provides re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance material for physicians who prescri@@ be acet@@ ate for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains indications how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor .
in April 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited to appro@@ ve Ac@@ la@@ sta &apos;s placing in the European Union .

oste@@ opor@@ osis treatment in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture .
for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg Ac@@ la@@ sta is recommended once a year .
in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) .
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with Ac@@ la@@ sta , a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) .
in patients with a recently diagnosed low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. is recommended or@@ ally or in@@ tra @-@ muscular vitamin D before the first Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorder ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance &lt; 35 ml / min , Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adaptation is not necessary because bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination in older patients are similar to younger patients .
children and adolescents Ac@@ la@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing .
Ac@@ la@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances &lt; 35 ml / min ) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ emia should be treated with acet@@ ate before starting the therapy with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in addition , it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient amount of calcium for patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get twice daily , at least 500 m@@ g. of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene should be examined before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive denti@@ stry .
for patients who require dental procedures , no data is available whether the break @-@ up of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta can be reduced by offering par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen just after the application of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the incidence of serious adverse events reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 from 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial ) the total frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between Ac@@ la@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) was comparable .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 .
ren@@ al dysfunction of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with ren@@ al dysfunction , which was associated with decrease of ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure .
the changes in the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance ( measured annually before administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as impaired ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the acet@@ ylene and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of the treatment was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta versus 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
based on the assessment of laboratory findings , temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels stood at 2.3 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in a large clinical trial compared to 21 % of patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials .
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis study in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get trials ( see section 4.2 ) .
in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a recently received hip frac@@ ture , vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
local reactions following the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental interven@@ ing .
7 patients with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients met oste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the jaw area with a patient treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta and a placebo @-@ treated patient .
in the case of over@@ dosing , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate .
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of Ac@@ la@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the lower neck &lt; -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric tissue frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new spinal frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
patients from 75 years old and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
effects on hip frac@@ tures Ac@@ la@@ sta showed a constant effect over three years , which resulted in reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) .
effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) Ac@@ la@@ sta increased bone density at lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) .
9 Incre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.@@ 0 % , the lower leg by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % .
bone hist@@ ology In the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , bone biop@@ si@@ es from the pel@@ vic area were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to placebo an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the traditional bone architecture .
bone turnover markers The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pe@@ p@@ tide of the serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in intervals during study duration .
after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dosage Ac@@ la@@ sta significantly reduced B@@ SAP by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below bas@@ eline value after 12 months and was held at 55 % below the bas@@ eline for up to 36 months .
vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks prior to in@@ fusion .
the total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the treated group treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all points in comparison to placebo treatment compared to placebo .
the Ac@@ la@@ sta treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo for an increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the overall level and by 4.3 % at the leg of the leg .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in Ac@@ la@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of acet@@ one compared to the once weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the bas@@ eline value .
clinical effectiveness of the treatment in the Pa@@ get of the bone Ac@@ la@@ sta was investigated in patients with radi@@ ologically approved , predominantly light to moder@@ ately severe patho@@ gen Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2,@@ 6@@ fold to 3,@@ 0@@ fold age @-@ specific upper normal value in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 m@@ g. of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies .
in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for acet@@ one and ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
from the 143 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at and the 107 patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at could be maintained at an average duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application .
one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fusion of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 m@@ g. of cit@@ ric acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent .
after that the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value .
rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ life t ½ = 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1,@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination interval t ½ g 146 hours .
the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above 1 ½ -@@ values ) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion through the kidneys .
in the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue .
the total body clearance is 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight .
an extension of the in@@ fusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration over time ) .
a dimin@@ ished clearing of met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 enzymes is unlikely because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or ir@@ reversible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ -
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing , 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this results in a slight ( c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney function down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
as for severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- clear@@ ances &lt; 30 ml / min ) only restricted data are available , no statements are possible for this population .
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ ally active intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight in rats .
for studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C @-@ 6@@ fold of the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence .
chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats was administered by taking doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the 7@@ x of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to the AU@@ C ) .
in long @-@ term studies with repeated exposure to cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including the gastro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as at the intraven@@ ous injection point were observed .
the most frequent disease in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance .
in rats one observed ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was im@@ printed at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lower serum calcium level .

z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the bone Pa@@ get of the bone .
decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men .
with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone structure takes place too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal .
Ac@@ la@@ sta counter@@ acts as it norm@@ alizes the bone structure , thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus adding strength to the bone .
if you are in a dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with Ac@@ la@@ sta .
if you use Ac@@ la@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / use other medicines or have taken / used recently , even if it is not prescription medicine .
it is especially important for your doctor to know if you take drugs that are known to damage the kidneys .
when using Ac@@ la@@ sta together with food and drink , you are concerned that you take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta in accordance with your doctor &apos;s instructions .
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
if you have recently broken the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture .
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein .
since Ac@@ la@@ sta operates for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or longer .
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium level in your blood does not become too low in time after in@@ fusion .
with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , Ac@@ la@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment .
if the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta has been missed , please contact your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment .
before c@@ ess@@ ation of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta If you are considering the termination of treatment with Ac@@ la@@ sta , please take notice of your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor .
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion perform very often ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but less frequently after subsequent in@@ fusion .
fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headache , occur within the first three days following the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
currently it is unclear whether Ac@@ la@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you notice such symptoms after you have received Ac@@ la@@ sta .

if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions of the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded .
in patients with a recently released low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , it is recommended to carry the in@@ fusion of Ac@@ la@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical care of the hip frac@@ ture .
before and after the administration of Ac@@ la@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive di@@ ure@@ tic therapy .
due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symp@@ tom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ ts@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after Ac@@ la@@ sta in@@ fusion .
in addition , it is highly advisable in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get a sufficient amount of calcium , equivalent to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of Ac@@ la@@ sta .
in patients with a recently issued low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. of oral or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of acet@@ one .

A@@ comp@@ lia is used in addition to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients , which suffer from obesity ( body mass index - BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond , one or more I
in addition , four studies were carried out on more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent in the setting of smoking compared to placebo .
the studies on the setting of smoking did not show uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess in this area of application .
which risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract .
it may also not be applied to patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or are treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients .

• The effectiveness and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant during the treatment of patients over 75 years were not shown sufficiently .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were completed by studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

abstract of the EP@@ AR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Auth@@ orities Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medicine ) is not indicated .
it may also be applied to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( in particular overweight patients ) that cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dosage .
in combination with sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of acet@@ yl@@ res@@ ine ( low blood sugar ) , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced .
this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sin@@ ks , making type 2 diabetes better .
in more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in tri@@ ple@@ therapie was investigated ; patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea , in addition , they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years .
the studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) indicating how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ tos lead to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg .
at the end of the trial study , the effect of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea revealed a 0.@@ 94 % reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c , while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % .
in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was studied in 28@@ 9 patients , patients receiving Ac@@ tos also reported a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c levels of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who also took placebo .
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were impaired vision , upper respiratory tract infections , weight gain and hypo@@ theses ( decreased sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) .
Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high level of ket@@ one levels - acid levels - in the blood ) .
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated .
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited to authori@@ ze the transport of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , arch@@ ed and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 15 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is in@@ sufficiently dis@@ continued with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
no data is available for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended .
in patients with at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve .
patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin .
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease was performed .
in this study , there was an increase in the reports of heart failure , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study .
in patients with increased enzyme levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
if the AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible .
if a patient develops symptoms that point to a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , abdominal discomfort , ti@@ redness , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , liver enzyme levels must be checked .
the decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be conducted by clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters have been submitted .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention .
as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a slight reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ o@@ cr@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3.@@ 6 @-@ 4.1 % ) and to a lesser extent in patients with sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral tw@@ o- or three @-@ cavity combination therapy with a sul@@ f@@ ony@@ lu@@ rea or two @-@ fold combination therapy with insulin are the risk of high dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported on the occurrence or wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity .
it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report about disorders of vision ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological examination should be considered .
in a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 fac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occ@@ ured in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not exercise relevant effects on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , such as oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not to be expected .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase of the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 times .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are dimin@@ ished and thereby the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for the fet@@ al growth is reduced .
very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( not to be estimated from this data ) .
these lead to a temporary change of the turbine and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens , as observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents .
in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T climbs above three times the upper limit of the normal range were similar to those of placebo , but less often than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl res@@ ins .
in an outcome study in patients with advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or respectively .
since the market launch rarely has been reported about cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
a summari@@ zing analysis of adverse events with regard to bone frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients was carried out in groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures occurred in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared .
pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one appears to activate activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated via an activation of specific nucle@@ i recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells in the animal model .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glu@@ cos@@ al production in the liver and increases peripheral glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ last@@ y in the event of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
at the time after two years of therapy , blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 0 % ) could be maintained by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide ) .
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ sufficiently dis@@ continued with insulin despite three months of optimisation were random@@ ised to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo .
in patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabe@@ tics .
in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slight but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed .
in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide reduce the total matrix gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and elevated the HD@@ L cholesterol level .
in comparison to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one whereas lower values were observed under met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the po@@ ets tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level and the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride synthesis .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ised in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular treatment .
after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is absorbed quickly , with the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma usually 2 hours after application .
on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal .
in interaction studies , it has been demonstrated that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not have a relevant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in .
the simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with ri@@ fi@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in the rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) .
the mean plasma elimination time of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours .
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral clearance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar .
in toxic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys , plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and reversible ex@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy occurred in mice , rats , dogs and monkeys .
this is due to the fact that , under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in the formation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal , thereby reducing the availability of metabolic sub@@ strates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased in@@ depen@@ dencies of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder were induced .
in an animal model of famili@@ al aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ a resulted in increased frequency of col@@ on tum@@ ors .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tos &quot; &quot; &quot; . &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 fac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occ@@ ured in 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medication .
in another study for two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ ze were investigated .
in clinical trials over 1 year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to bas@@ eline data .
in a study of more than 20 weeks , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only reduced the po@@ ets tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial elevated tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level , this both on an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eride level absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis .
although the study failed to determine its primary end@@ point , which was a combination of the total mortal , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , cor@@ on@@ ary rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization and rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no cardiovascular long @-@ term risks are connected .

Ac@@ cor@@ ph@@ ane is usually applied once or twice daily when a rapid initial action combined with a longer lasting effect is desired .

Ac@@ cor@@ ph@@ ane was tested in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin effectively .
the study measured the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) after 12 weeks indicating how good the blood sugar is set .
Ac@@ cor@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood sugar levels have been reduced similarly to another human@@ oid .
Ac@@ cor@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
in addition , the doses of acet@@ one may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that may affect the blood sugar ( see the complete list of the package contents ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ yl@@ ates in the treatment of diabetes were out@@ weighed against the risks .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the marketing of ac@@ o@@ ph@@ ane in the European Union .
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial action combined with a longer lasting effect is desired .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose has been inj@@ ected .
patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy may be able to change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly .
any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , human insulin or insulin analog ) and / or manufacturing method ( due to re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin of animal origin ) may cause a change in dosage .
if a dose adjustment is required when switching to acet@@ one in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over .
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different than previous insulin .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
therefore , the doctor must consider possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines .
4 B@@ oth hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia as well as hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia which may occur in a non @-@ controlled diabe@@ tic therapy increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics may lead to un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and cause temporary or permanent brain function disorders and even death .
diseases of the nervous system Ac@@ tu@@ ally - Periph@@ eral neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid recovery of blood sugar control can be associated with discomfort known as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually reversible .
5 . intensi@@ fying insulin therapy with an ab@@ rupt improvement in blood sugar levels can be associated with a temporary wor@@ sen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic retin@@ opathy .
a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site if neglected to change the insertion points within the injection area .

hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by oral supply of glucose and sug@@ ary foods .
diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape sugar , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Wei@@ ght hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias with un@@ consciousness are treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) by an un@@ balanced auxiliary person or by glucose administered intraven@@ ously by the doctor .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of the action is up to 24 hours .
res@@ or@@ ption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast resp@@ . delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a number of fis@@ sur@@ es ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) locations on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split is active .
based on the conventional studies on safety disease , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular dangers to humans .

this document is a summary of the European Public Auth@@ orities Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the active ingredient in acet@@ yl , insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) , is made using the method of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant technology &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; &quot;

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
it may also be necessary to adjust the doses of Ac@@ cor@@ p@@ id if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar .
in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S to authori@@ ze the marketing of Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id throughout the European Union .
when two types of insulin are mixed , first the amount of the rapidly acting insulin must be raised , then the amount of long acting insulin .
3 If a dose adjustment is required in the patient when changing to acet@@ one , it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion .
before travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician , as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times .
5 General conditions and complaints at the administration site - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions at the injection point Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma may occur at the injection site ) .

a clinical trial in an intensive care unit for the treatment of hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous hem@@ o@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
the effect starts within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total duration is approximately 7 to 8 hours .
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ cor@@ p@@ id was studied at a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
the data are limited , but suggest that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of children and adolescents is similar to that of adults .

&quot; &quot; &quot; aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients with signs of de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
if the ur@@ ic acid level is still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day .
g@@ out attacks can still occur during the first months of treatment ; therefore , it is recommended that patients continue to use other medicines at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic .
the medicine is not recommended in children and for patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
in the first study , involving 1,@@ 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with a placebo ( pseu@@ do @-@ medication ) and allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) .
in the second study two doses of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg once a day ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid level in the blood was below 6 mg / dl for the last three measurements .
in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took Aden@@ o@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who received 120 mg once daily , in the last three measurements showed a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl .
in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo .
the most common side effects of Aden@@ o@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea ) , rash and abnormal liver enzymes .
in particular in patients with heart problems in pre @-@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the lowering of the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood was more effective than allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but could also increase the risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels .
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to pri@@ mor@@ dial deposits ( including a current or current g@@ out node and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into account on AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
in patients with severe ren@@ al dysfunction , efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated ( cre@@ atine clearing &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) .
children and adolescents As there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended .
since organ transplan@@ t recipients do not have any experience , the use of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) .
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure , treatment with f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
as with other drug @-@ containing medicines , acute g@@ out attacks can occur during the treatment , because the lowering of serum acid levels can initially mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue .
B. for malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the ur@@ inary tract .
liver diseases Dur@@ ing phase 3 clinical trials slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ sta@@ sis treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine Z@@ war did not conduct AC studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ ll lens ( an in@@ hibition of the metabolism of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) .
in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen is 250 mg twice daily with a rise in f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure exposure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) .
in clinical trials , the application of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events .
col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / in@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ o@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / war@@ far@@ in f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without the need for a dose adjustment for f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient .
in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , suggest@@ ing a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vivo .
an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids containing magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide contains the absorption of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and a decline in the C@@ max by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C .
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) .
patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or when performing hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC does not adver@@ sely affect their performance .

clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia and g@@ out .
in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with the last three month specific serum acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl .
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the traditionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

lowering the serum acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg of 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al in@@ hibition of the AP@@ EX @-@ study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( D ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients .
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage return of serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of g@@ out attacks ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a g@@ out ) .
this was associated with a reduction in the size of the g@@ out , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the lymp@@ h no@@ des until month 24 .
increased TS@@ H values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in open long term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
in healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose @-@ propor@@ tionally .
for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in the AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is larger than the dose proportional increase .
after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
however , no clin@@ ically significant changes in serum acid concentration were observed if this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) .
distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma retention of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration range , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .

after taking an 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as imm@@ utable f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) .
in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion beyond the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the stool was found as imm@@ utable f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , am@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active substance ( 1 % ) , its known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) .
special patients &apos; groups of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function .
the mean total AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 @-@ fold from 7.5 to 7.@@ 5@@ μ , in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ meg@@ alo@@ h / ml in the group with severe kidney function .

these findings are seen as a result of specific pur@@ in@@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zation and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day , f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which there is a risk for a low vitamin D mirror .
the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) .
in order to avoid irritation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day , at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature .
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels .
after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE was lower ( 11 % ) than those treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) .
the company also presented data that indicates that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE matches exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss .
the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pains of the muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( swal@@ lowing disorders ) , batter@@ ed abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as sour upset .
in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other components AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be applied .
it must not be used in cases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes .
in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd . approval for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the European Union .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only to be taken with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or taking medication ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day .
the following indications are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
• AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • Pati@@ ents should not ch@@ ew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ oses . • Pati@@ ents should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day , which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
B. pe@@ p@@ tic ul@@ cers , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , apart from p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , are given only under special care ( see Section 4.3 ) .
es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions such as op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ holes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( some of them were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) .
the doctor should therefore be aware of any signs and symptoms that indicate potential es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be pointed out , in the presence of symptoms of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain when swal@@ lowing or retro@@ gres@@ sional pain or new or wor@@ sen@@ ing heart@@ burn the medicine and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
3 The risk of severe but@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the onset of symptoms that point to es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation .
it is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
while in large @-@ scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk has been identified , stomach and du@@ oden@@ al ul@@ cers , some of which are severe and with complications , were reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis of the jaw , usually related to tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regi@@ men mainly contain intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate .
there are no data available to indicate whether the setting of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ arthritis of the jaw .
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after having noticed their failure .
you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week .
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time .
patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
although specific interaction studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions .
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by nursing women .
animal studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate leave no indication of directly damaging effects in regard to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most reports are from cancer patients but also reported in oste@@ opor@@ osis patients .
nevertheless , decreases in serum cal@@ ci@@ ums up to &lt; 8.@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar frequency .
Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ her@@ itance of an oral over@@ dose may occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a .

fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled studies , with which Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily for 2 years and then 10 mg daily either over 1 or 2 years ) :
in this study , the daily dose of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at reduced the occurrence of at least one new spinal cont@@ our by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % versus placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

bio@@ availability rose accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % if Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken one or half an hour before a standardized breakfast .
in oste@@ opor@@ osis , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first eating or drinking of the day .
in healthy volunteers the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
9 Distribution studies in rats show that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is temporarily distributed in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then quickly disper@@ sed into the bone or ex@@ cre@@ ted with the urine .
after intraven@@ ous administration of a single dose of 14@@ C @-@ Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate approximately 50 % of the radio@@ actively marked substance was ex@@ cre@@ ted within 72 hours with the urine and little or no radio@@ activity was found in the rot@@ ting .

adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients who have been transplan@@ ted a kidney or liver in order to prevent the transplan@@ ted organ from re@@ pul@@ sed by the immune system .
as tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results of previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature .
furthermore , the results of a clinical study were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplantation , compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ t or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
in addition , shorter additional studies were performed in 119 patients with kidney transplantation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ t and studied how Adv@@ agra@@ ph is absorbed by the body compared to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft .

in patients with any hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro@@ li@@ de antibiotics ( such as er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , lawyers may not be applied .
patients and doctors must be careful when other ( in particular some herbal ) drugs are taken simultaneously with adv@@ agra@@ f , as the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the medication taken at the same time must be adapted appropriately .
hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded yellow @-@ orange gel capsules , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule section with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ s@@ ular bottom with &quot; ring 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder .
only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to transplan@@ t rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a medical device experienced in the transplantation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adjustments must be carried out in order to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the dosage of adv@@ agra@@ ph should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood reflection regulations ( see &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) &quot; &quot; &quot;
after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Tal@@ ks should be controlled before the change@@ over and over two weeks after switching .
in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a tal@@ low level , was comparable with both form@@ ulations in both ni@@ er@@ y- and liver @-@ transplan@@ ted patients .
careful and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus tal@@ low are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under adv@@ agra@@ f in order to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ t phase .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the adv@@ agra@@ ph can chemistry may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached .
if the patient &apos;s condition does not allow oral in@@ gest@@ ing of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for manufacturing an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca .
duration of application To supp@@ ress transplan@@ t rejection must be maintained by immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified .
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
further can adjustments may later be necessary , as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ t pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection The oral adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start at 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily dose in the morning .
dosage recommendation - switch from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f Do a transplan@@ t recipient of two daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to be converted to a once daily dose of adv@@ agra@@ ph , this change in ratio of 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose , has to take place .
kidney and liver transplan@@ ts After a change from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day , the oral initial dose for the pro@@ phyla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must commen@@ ce with the recommended oral initial dose in ren@@ al and liver transplan@@ ts .
an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in adult patients who are referred to as Adv@@ agra@@ f .
other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with adv@@ agra@@ ph in lung , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ ts , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day in case of transplan@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day .
dosage changes in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area , a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction .
patients with reduced kidney function Sin@@ ce the kidney function has no influence on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required .
however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cre@@ atine , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ filtr@@ ates and a monitoring of the urine volume ) is recommended .
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy , caution is required ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the level of the bottom blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases with the aid of full blood tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low @-@ mirror controls .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
blood tal@@ low levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus should also be checked after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to adv@@ agra@@ ph , dosage adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the simultaneous use of substances that might change the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus whole blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) .
since adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred .
clinical studies indicate that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice , the tal@@ low level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with adren@@ al and heart@@ felt patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
during the subsequent maintenance treatment of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used .
this has led to serious adverse events including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects that can occur as a result of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure .
patients should always maintain the same Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a medical device experienced in the transplantation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is available .
no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is available for the prevention of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ ts and transplan@@ ts in childhood .
because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other plant remedies during a treatment with adv@@ agra@@ ph is to be avoided ( see section 4.5 ) .
in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is offered because the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances .
in rare cases the anterior chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ hi@@ e described as cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was observed , which can therefore also occur under adv@@ agra@@ ph .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malign@@ ant skin les@@ ions by suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor .
if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are symptoms of PRE@@ S like head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , conv@@ ul@@ sions and vision disturbances , radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g .
since Adv@@ agra@@ f Hart@@ capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose contain , special care is required in patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption .
the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and thus increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
therefore , it is recommended to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels while offering substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus surcharge accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) .
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , it@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z .
Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or decrease the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood .
the effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ hibition ; hence , the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can affect their metabolism .
because tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormone level , it is particularly cau@@ tious when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures .
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus potentially reduces the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and can pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that in contrast to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy .
in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for any adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( in particular with regard to its effect on the kidneys ) .
there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ kal@@ emia of new@@ bor@@ ns ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. :
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant drugs is often not precisely identified because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a multitude of other medicines .
subsequently , the side effects are listed in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .

cases of alpha @-@ virus @-@ associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with adv@@ agra@@ f .
ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V @-@ associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors in connection with the treatment with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were reported .
due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , it can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ sis .
at the molecular level , the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus are likely to be medi@@ ated by its binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the enrich@@ ment of the connection in the cellular memory .
this leads to a calcium @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes genes .
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( like inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor .

results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus following other primary organ transplan@@ tations Pro@@ gra@@ f have developed into an approved primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant following pancre@@ atic , lung and color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ tations .
175 patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who had a pancre@@ atic transplan@@ t and in 6@@ 30 cases were treated as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive surgery in 6@@ 30 cases .
overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies was consistent with the major studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ ts .
lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported who received either Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in in 1 : 1 random@@ isation .
chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans@@ - syndrome , was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) .
the survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) .
in the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus it came in 21.@@ 7 % of cases to the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , An@@ n Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) .
the number of cases in which no acute gra@@ ft rejection happened was higher after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the treatment transplan@@ ted patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) .
in a study , the frequency of the emergence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
pancre@@ atic transplantation A multi@@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed in 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancre@@ atic and kidney transplantation , receiving a random@@ ised trial of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml to 5 .
color@@ ec@@ tal transplantation The published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ec@@ tal transplan@@ tations showed a current survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years .

factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cri@@ t and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , or a strengthening of metabolism led through treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance rates observed after the transplan@@ t .
this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly done via the bile .
in stable patients , which were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ f ( once a day ) in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) in relation to the total daily dose , systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ ph was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f .
it is recommended to perform frequent controls of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ tal@@ low during the first two weeks after transplantation , followed by periodi@@ c controls during maintenance therapy .
21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation is available .
other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma .
28 confirmed acute rejection was 32.@@ 6 % in the first 24 weeks in the advance group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

advise is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( a con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II ) .
the dosage and frequency of use depend on whether advoc@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in the joints , muscles or internal organs .
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but produced by a method called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II .
it is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is produced differently , so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin .
in three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures .
in the main study , the efficacy of lawyers in the prevention of bleeding was assessed in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic episodes with &quot; excellent &quot; respectively &quot; good . &quot;
the most common side effects of lawyers ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II .
it may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients .
in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for the marketing of lawyers throughout the European Union .
dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the sever@@ ity of factor VI@@ II deficiency , the location and extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient .
in the case of the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels ( in % of the norm or in I.@@ E. / dl ) .
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until pain and acute depression are removed .
repeat injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
during the course of the treatment , appropriate determination of the factor VI@@ II plasma cruci@@ ble is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VI@@ II , reach different in vivo recovery and show different half @-@ value times .
3 Pre@@ vention of long @-@ term pro@@ phyla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight at intervals of 2 @-@ 3 days .
if the expected Factor VI@@ II plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled by a suitable dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary .
in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered .
the administration rate should vary according to the patient &apos;s application , but a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded .
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against factor VI@@ II is a known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II targeted Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Be@@ thes@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Be@@ thes@@ da as@@ say .
the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors .
in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and am@@ n@@ estic known inhibit@@ ors , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors was observed .
due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation .
A@@ DR@@ s , which occurred in the largest number of patients , were inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ing the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) .
very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rarely &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data cannot be estimated ) .
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop in the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ ke occurred post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th post@@ oper@@ atively ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
during the whole time , blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained , and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Mir@@ ror of the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day of the day .
in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Be@@ thes@@ da approach ) after 26 exposure days .
in addition , in none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed serious until moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was detected after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
in previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical study , 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors of factor VI@@ II .
the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects .
one patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant up@@ trend and a persistent peak of antibody level against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity .
in four patients the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ op@@ hil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study .

based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefit @-@ risk weighing as a positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons :
therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates submission of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , so that the authorisation holder is to apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years .
in December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company has withdrawn its application for the marketing of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
usually , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft parts ( fabric that connects , surrounds and supports other structures in the body ) are affected .
this is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
advance could have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
the p@@ 53 protein , which is produced from the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered .
in case of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide .
the company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Krebs appeared in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain .
after the CH@@ MP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked to him , some questions were still unclear .
based on the review of the initially submitted documentation , the CH@@ MP generates 120 a list of questions sent to the company .
according to the CH@@ MP , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of adv@@ ex@@ in in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors benefits patients .
the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug .
in addition , the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be established in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient .
the company did not notify the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; altered active substance release &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours . &quot; &quot; &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever , inflammation of the nas@@ al passages caused by allergy to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
for adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are clari@@ fied .
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main efficacy deviations were the changes in the sever@@ ity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
in consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose , the patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patients who received pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone .
if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a decrease in symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone .
the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , dry mouth , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ om@@ otor hyper@@ activity ( rest@@ lessness ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ som@@ nia ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sleep@@ iness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other components that are active against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be applied to patients suffering from narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , isch@@ uria ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ i@@ dis@@ m ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) or a ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge ) or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke .
on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to transport Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze to the European Union .
the tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) .
due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end .
it is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in time .
after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy .
as Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within the 2 weeks following completion of such a therapy .
this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity combined with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , di@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) .
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data did not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data did not suff@@ ice to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
patients need to be informed that the treatment of hypertension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be stopped .
in the treatment of the following patient groups , caution is advised : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as • Pati@@ ents with hypertension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck , or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is to be dep@@ rec@@ ated at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions .
in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed .
the results of the psych@@ om@@ otor test showed no significant differences between those treated with placebo and placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether or not the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was taken alone or with alcohol .
the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
in @-@ vivo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
the safety of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , however , experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancy did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of the normal population .
since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tive properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness which can lead to impairment of the transport ability or the ability to operate machinery .
symptoms may vary between CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ ano@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trem@@ ors , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible sequ@@ ential processes .
headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscular weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , excitement , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , thirst , tran@@ spir@@ ation , nausea , vom@@ iting , prec@@ es@@ sional pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , vision disturbances and hypertension or hyp@@ ot@@ onia .
CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( dry mouth , p@@ up@@ illary star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin comfort , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) .
these include both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the P @-@ Selec@@ tin adhesion molecule on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
during a single dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in controlled clinical studies no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo .
the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ tom@@ atic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of a CN@@ S arous@@ al .
1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets .
in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher compared to the total score for symptoms ( excluding mu@@ cous membrane swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine for the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the efficacy of aerobic tablets showed no significant difference in terms of gender , age or eth@@ ni@@ city .
as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma .
after the oral application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy volunteers over 14 days , the body weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on Day 10 .
in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects were poor in lost lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio @-@ equivalent was to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
based on conventional studies on safety disease , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with lost radi@@ n can not identify any particular dangers for humans .
the combination did not possess a greater toxic@@ ity than its constitu@@ ents , and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine .
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application , the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system described is established and works before and while the product is on the market .
anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to the allevi@@ ation of the allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , its effect .
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets can relieve symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .

following the market launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( short@@ ness of breath , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash have been reported .
in cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart@@ thro@@ ats , abdominal pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , nausea , in@@ som@@ nia , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of con@@ spic@@ uous liver values was also reported very rarely .
it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ ate for taking ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg and 5 m@@ g. melting tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution .
for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once daily , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or sy@@ rup .
for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or either .
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who had also asthma ) .
the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ ru@@ ple , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment .
further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utili@@ zes the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless .
in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of ap@@ eri@@ us led to an average decrease in symptom scores ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in the patients receiving a placebo .
in the two studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease of symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo .
A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , lau@@ rel or any of the other components .
in January 2001 , the European Commission issued approval to the company SP Europe for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .
one tablet once a day , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous course of disease and can be stopped after the symptoms decay and resum@@ ed after re@@ occurring .
in the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks ) , a continuing treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impairment of the transport ability or the ability to operate machinery .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
the most common adverse events reported on placebo were fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) .
in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 , the most common side effect was head@@ aches , this occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and in 6.@@ 9 % of the patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) .
this includes both inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ op@@ hil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the optic molecule P @-@ Selec@@ tin on endo@@ theli@@ al cells .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ enni@@ al , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can alternatively be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms .
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s .
the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be random@@ ly recru@@ ited .
since hist@@ amine release is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n also leads to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines .
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing size and number of quad@@ ru@@ des at the end of the first dose interval .
as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study .
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and w@@ aking , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study comparing patient demo@@ s with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients achieved higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded .
neither C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ E and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ oric breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
the prec@@ lin@@ ical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .
based on the conventional studies on safety disease , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular dangers for humans .

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken irrespective of meals , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that there are no data available that support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin analyses should play a role .
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabol@@ ise des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup for children between 2 and 11 years , which met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally .
this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall frequency of adverse events in children between the ages of 2 and 11 was similar to the placebo group .
in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , at recommended dose 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) .
children between the ages of 1 and 11 who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily loss ad@@ in dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults and children are similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .
in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine @-@ times the clinical dose ) over ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval .
in controlled clinical studies , the recommended dose of 5 mg per day for adults and adolescents showed no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness compared to placebo .
in a single daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies led to no impairment of psych@@ om@@ otor activity .
in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies of adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol was neither a reinforcement of alcohol @-@ induced impairment of performance nor an increase in drow@@ sin@@ ess .
in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .
as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in improving pr@@ ur@@ itus and reducing size and number of quad@@ ru@@ des at the end of the first dose interval .
the spread of this limited metabol@@ isation phen@@ otype was similar in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations larger in bl@@ acks ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ asi@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) .
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze fully met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ max approximately 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after once daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) for 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In different single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients were comparable with those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out .
A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bra@@ i@@ ded glass bottles with child safe polypropylene sealing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .

immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ism can be removed for taking in without damaging it .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets , where er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally used ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets than in patients treated with placebo .
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study involving up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dosage ) .
A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ op@@ hil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated in two single dose studies ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G @-@ interval data .
as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described .

in controlled clinical studies no increased frequency of sleep@@ iness was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo .
in a 17 single @-@ dose study of adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , tear@@ ing and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate .

two ap@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets should be put in the mouth once a day for reli@@ eving symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it .
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of enam@@ el tablets during the treatment of children under the age of 6 have not been proven until now .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the loss and placebo group was equal and did not significantly differ from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
at the recommended dosage , A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ tray was a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 m@@ g. of conventional tablets form@@ ulations and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ism for the incorpor@@ ation formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n .

in an adult single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleep@@ iness or tasks associated with flying .
the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pa@@ edi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) bigger than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( adults 18 % , children 3 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population .
in single @-@ dose cross @-@ over trials of A@@ eri@@ us melt tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ op@@ hil@@ ism to take , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent .
A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not tested on pedi@@ atric patients but in combination with the dose @-@ sensitivity studies in children , however , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us enam@@ el tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years .

if you forgot to take A@@ eri@@ us Mel@@ amine tablet If you forgot to take your dose in time , take it as soon as possible , and then follow the normal treatment plan .
after the market introduction of A@@ eri@@ us , very rare cases of severe allergic reactions ( difficulty breathing , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , swelling ) and rash are reported .
A@@ eri@@ us solution is indicated for children aged between 1 and 11 years , adolescents ( 12 years and older ) and adults , including older people .
if the solution for insertion is an application sy@@ ringe for preparations for insertion with sc@@ aling , you can use this alternative to take the appropriate amount of solution to take .
regarding the duration of treatment , your doctor will determine the type of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s you suffer from and will determine how long you should take A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking .
however , frequent side effects were frequent in children under 2 years of age , fever and in@@ som@@ nia during adults fatigue , dry mouth and head@@ aches more often than with placebo .
97 A@@ eri@@ us solution for accepting is available in bottles with child safe closing cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml .
the 150 ml sach@@ et size is a measuring spoon or an application sp@@ lash for preparing to take with scales of 2.5 m@@ l@@ - and 5 ml cans .
June 2008 , Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially announced the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company withdraw@@ s its application for the marketing of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov for the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influ@@ enza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influ@@ enza caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it .
once the vaccine is administered , the immune system recognis@@ es the constitu@@ ent parts of the flu virus as &quot; foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it .
this makes the immune system later able to produce antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus of this trunk .
subsequently , the membrane shell of the virus was cleaned , cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a foreign body ) .
an inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
as a result , the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines .
if you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor .
if you would like further information on the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) .
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with the Human Immun@@ o@@ deficiency Virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
for patients unable to swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been studied .
A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which anti@@ viral drug has been taken by the patient before , and the probability has judged that the virus is addressed to the medicine .
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
in children between the age of four and twelve , and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase depends on body weight .
in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , A@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV level in the blood and keeps it at a low level .
not cure AIDS , however , can delay damage to the immune system and therefore also the development of infections and diseases connected to AIDS .
A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had not previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
it was compared with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults who used early prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of patients with no det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
in trials with patients who had previously not taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml under placebo for 48 weeks , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r .
in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors only very few responded to the treatment .
in the study of adults who previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
in the patients with HIV that was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , A@@ gener@@ ase combined with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their former prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( nausea ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue .
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components .
A@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s Wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or drugs that are degra@@ ded just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are det@@ ri@@ mental in high concentrations in the blood .
as with other medicines for HIV , there is a risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , oste@@ on@@ ec@@ tin ( the death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of ather@@ ase in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children were predomin@@ ant over four years compared to the risks .
A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee noted that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors has not been proven .
&quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot; &quot; &quot;
in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the marketing of A@@ gener@@ ase in the entire European Union .
A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
usually A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not studied in children .
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy ( see section 5.2 ) .
based on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily .
con@@ current use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with care , in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ prop@@ um 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and may continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences .
for the case of simultaneous antibiotic treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine .
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function , including chronic active hepatitis , show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid@@ al effects including C@@ ush@@ ing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
because the inter@@ change of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of a@@ generic with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
in patients who take these drugs at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high suscep@@ ti@@ bility to propylene , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus was reported .
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed for their therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
B . higher age , and associated with drug @-@ related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or wor@@ sen@@ ing of symptoms .
although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ec@@ lip@@ se were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ strates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ iso@@ prop@@ um 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be given together with medicines , whose active ingredients are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed mainly via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
in the attempt to balance the low plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , adverse effects on the liver were often observed .
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be decreased by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
if a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the viral load levels and , if possible , check the viral load and remove the St. John &apos;s Wort .
dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ max is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which substanti@@ ate the efficacy and safety of this treatment diagram .
52 % hum@@ bled when am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are given twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but due to the f@@ antasi@@ es of di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine it is recommended that di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and a@@ generic income are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) .
therefore , in the application of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustment is required .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may reduce the serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
if these medicines should be used at the same time , caution is required as del@@ a@@ virus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma cruci@@ ble .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to a rise in side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended , although no clinical data is available .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been performed , however the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration .
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase of the C@@ max of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) once daily without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ strates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , may lead to interactions , if applied together with a@@ generic .
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines if used in combination with a@@ generic .
based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da should not be taken at the same time as a@@ generic as it can cause res@@ or@@ ption defects .
the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va known as enzyme products ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , fel@@ odi@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine .
simultaneous consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors associated side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days in subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pion@@ ate plasma levels rose significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) .
as a result , the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid@@ al effects ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time by ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ gener@@ ase .
because plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended as plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased while adding am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) .
therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase cannot be used together with or@@ ally taken Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) while using A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
data for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 fa@@ ders .
if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the patients should be monitored on op@@ ium withdrawal symptoms , especially if also low doses of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered .
due to the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how the am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus can be adjusted if am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is administered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one .
with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or reinforcement of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a re@@ production study of pregnant rats , given by the implantation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during pregnancy .
further development of the seed , including fertility and reproductive ability , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
most side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase Treatment were mild to moderate , early up and rarely lead to treatment failure .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which the patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors have not received 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day .
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as subsequent laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are performed .
anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and differential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased in@@ tra @-@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ sal fat accumulation ( stit@@ ching ) .
under 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ ine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) ( &lt; 1 % ) was observed .
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , in 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ - pre @-@ treated patients were found under Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
skin r@@ ashes were usually mild to moderate , er@@ y@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ y nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV infection or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) .
HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections at the time of initiation of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
with PI pre@@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice a day along with low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 3 and 4 ) were comparable in patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase along with low @-@ dose k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r very frequently .
in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is aware of an indication of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .

the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is 0,@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0,@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells
the relationship between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients who received 700@@ mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined .
gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients not previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults .

in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors :
based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing , phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS AC 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance to the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or I@@ 50@@ V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , V@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / F , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in conjunction with an increased phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance to Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and a reduced probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) .
the conclusions about the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests .
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically phen@@ otyp@@ ical cut @-@ offs ( separation points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved .
there are currently data on cross @-@ resistance between am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations .
based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ a@@ virus @-@ containing scheme failed ( one of them showed resistance to Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) , sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 isol@@ ates ) .
on the contrary , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
early failure of a failure treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
the proof of the efficacy of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI pre@@ treated adults tested with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ kle@@ osi@@ d@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the partial study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 .
the primary analysis showed the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ difference threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bi@@ ased A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI .
in the studies A@@ gener@@ ase was tested for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily .
there was no low dose of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s combined with A@@ gener@@ ase .
after 48 weeks approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml of a medi@@ an increase in the CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 19 B@@ ased on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ spent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
after oral administration , the mean duration ( T@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution .
if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , it increases by 30 % .
the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of res@@ or@@ ption .
the apparent division volume is approximately 430 l@@ bs ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged .
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active constitu@@ ent fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval as a function of the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to c@@ min , ss .
therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ E or present a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be administered cau@@ ti@@ ously if they are given at the same time with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily .
am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bio@@ available than from the capsules ; hence , A@@ gener@@ ase Solution and A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis .
the ren@@ al clearance of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction could be limited to the elimination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
these treatment schemes result in am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r plasma levels compared to those obtained twice a day in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r without the simultaneous administration of k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas occ@@ ured in dos@@ ages , which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.8 times ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the development of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cellular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
however , there were few indications of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application .
in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gene ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations on human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen@@ ic nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic .
this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and verified in the clinical routine by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase .
until now , no significant liver toxic@@ ity has been observed in patients neither during the administration of the treatment or after the end of the treatment .
studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development .
24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
simultaneous use should be performed in patients with weak or slight liver function disorder , in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be set in duration 27 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ related factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ max is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice a day with the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) are given twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily .
dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , but close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
if these medicines are used together , caution is required ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ a@@ virus is difficult .
if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with A@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be reduced to at least half of the recommended dose 31 although no clinical data is available .

with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with A@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of atten@@ u@@ ation or reinforcement of the anti@@ th@@ rom@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) .
the simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
this drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus .
a re@@ production study of pregnant rats , given by the implantation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
in case of over@@ dosage , the patient is aware of an indication of an in@@ to@@ xi@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary supporting measures .
the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in vitro versus HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was examined both in acute and chron@@ ically infected lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes .
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and is 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
on the contrary , Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r maintains its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates .
&quot; &quot; &quot; based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ ob@@ st@@ oo@@ ster@@ tem &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage share of the free active constitu@@ ent fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval as a function of the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ max , ss to c@@ min , ss .

studies on toxic@@ ity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r .
these results suggest that the metabolism is not fully mat@@ ured in young animals , so that am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z .
A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards .
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase Solution was not covered with pre @-@ treated patients with PI pre@@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution to take up is 14 % less than of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base are not ex@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swal@@ low the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
in addition , since there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking in and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups .
although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is not deemed necessary for necessary , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) .
due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure .
con@@ current administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects like ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z . ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of 47 transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under monitoring of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available .
A@@ gener@@ ase should be put down permanently if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders .
in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports on an increase of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and ha@@ em@@ ar@@ thro@@ sis occur .
it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % decrease in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
50@@ 8 % increases , whereas C@@ max is reduced by 30 % when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) .
simultaneous consumption with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors , including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) .
based on the data of 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , a significant higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after the oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for humans is not known . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , the A@@ gener@@ ase solution may not be used during pregnancy as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.3 ) .
in the milk of lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r passes into breast milk in humans .
a re@@ production study of pregnant rats , given by the implantation in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation period of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight during pregnancy .
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
many of these events have not been clari@@ fied whether they are associated with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease .
in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre@@ treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors - the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed .
early failure of a failure 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations within limits which can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; 62 B@@ ased on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ spent &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be considered in the optimisation of treatment with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the apparent division volume is approximately 430 l@@ bs ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and allows for a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ obstruc@@ ted penetration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .

it may harm other people even if they have the same complaints as you . − When one of the listed side effects you significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
your doctor will usually instruc@@ t you to use A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy the effect of A@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of A@@ gener@@ ase will be based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment history .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from one of the above conditions or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
if your doctor has recommended that you take A@@ gener@@ ase capsules along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy the effect ( boo@@ sting ) , make sure that you read the instructions for use at Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r before starting the treatment .
there is also no sufficient information to recommend the use of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to increase the effectiveness of children between 4 and 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; &quot; &quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; When taking A@@ gener@@ ase with other medicines &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot; &quot; &quot;

application frequency and duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • In case of genital war@@ ts in the genital area , Al@@ dar@@ a can be applied three times a week for six weeks . • In case of small BC@@ Cs , it is repeated three times a week during one or two weeks of treatment .
before bed@@ time , the cream is th@@ inn@@ y to apply to the affected areas of the skin , so that it remains sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before being washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies in 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies where the patients were treated for six weeks and Al@@ dar@@ a or the placebo were carried out either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after 12 weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
• In all studies Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of patients in the genital area , the total treatment rate was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo , but only 3 % to 18 % in the patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete healing rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application area of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .

the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to continue until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ anal area , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
an interruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered if intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
if the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) .
if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then continue with the usual therapy plan .
spread the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème into a thin layer and rub it in the clean@@ sed , infected skin area until the cream is completely absorbed .
these patients should be weighing up between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible ag@@ gra@@ vation of their auto@@ immune disease .
there should be a weighing between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft versus host reaction .
in other studies , in which no daily in@@ timacy was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and a case with a stri@@ k@@ ture leading to circumcision were observed .
in case of an application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème in higher doses than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irritation were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or led to a temporary physical impairment .
in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties in ur@@ ination that necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area .
no clinical experience has so far been available for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous applied remedies for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peri@@ anal@@ ic@@ ular area .
although limited data points to an increased rate of incl@@ ine reduction in HIV positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème has shown lower efficacy in this group of patients with regard to the elimination of the genital war@@ ts .
the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips or the hair@@ line was not studied .
local skin reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions occurs generally during therapy or the reactions atro@@ phy after treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream .
if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the sever@@ ity of local skin reactions , a treatment break may be made from several days .
the clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
as currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available , other appropriate forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in case of super @-@ defici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas .
no clinical experiences are available in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors .
data from an open clinical study indicates that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower lik@@ el@@ ihood of response to i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , in the inside of the nose or in the ears or on the lip area inside the lip@@ id .
very limited data is available on the use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside the face and scal@@ p .
the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application , therefore such an application is not recommended .
local skin reactions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take off in intensity over therapy or go back after replacing the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream .
if the local skin reactions cause large discomfort or are very strong for the patient , the treatment may be suspended for several days .
the data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 les@@ ions showed lower healing rates than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
due to the immune @-@ stimulating properties , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with care in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) .
animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) .
although the serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) are not quanti@@ fiable after one @-@ time use , no recommendation can be given to the application during the lac@@ tation period .
the most common adverse events associated with the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in the studies with three @-@ week treatment were local reactions at the location of the treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the most frequently reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od Cream regarding side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the reported side @-@ effects reported by 185 with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream from a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical study are described below .
the most common side effect , probably or possibly associated with the application of the i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème , was in these studies a response to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
the side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
according to the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème often lead to local skin reactions including er@@ y@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ec@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / leaf @-@ off ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) .
according to the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan , these studies often showed severe er@@ y@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) in these studies with five times weekly treatment , and severe scor@@ ing and nar@@ rowing ( 19 % ) .
in clinical trials for the treatment of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area .
the accidental single oral absorption of 200 mg of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever .
the clin@@ ically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ onia which norm@@ alized after oral or IV fluids .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines have been demonstrated after topical use of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy with regard to full healing of the genital war@@ ts in an i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior .
in 60 % of the total number of patients who had been treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the patients were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 15@@ 7 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 patients treated with placebo ( 95 % CI :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years show that approximately 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically cured and this continued for 48 months .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies .
patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic act les@@ ions within a connected 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or face .
the single @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies indicate a recur@@ rent rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods .
the permitted indications of external fi@@ gs , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined .
Al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children between 2 and 15 years old with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) .
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or less .
a minimal systemic absorption of 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cr@@ ème with the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three @-@ week application during 16 weeks .
the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face ( 12@@ ,5 mg , 1 dispos@@ able p@@ ou@@ ch ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) .
the calculated apparent half @-@ life time was about 10 times higher than the half @-@ life time after sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin .
the systemic exposure data showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od@@ ine after topical application on MC @-@ affected skin of patients at the age of 6 @-@ 12 was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ natural bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
in a four @-@ month study of der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months also showed no similar effects in the mouse .
a two @-@ year study of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors in the application area .
the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mut@@ agen@@ ic , there is a risk for the human being due to the systemic exposure as very low .
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower U@@ VR .

the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect regarding the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) .
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me decreased the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study .
the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) include headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site .
very common side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may react strongly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reactions ) .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be known each year and , if necessary , update this summary .
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies .
in June 2003 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mamm@@ oth cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ ster ) .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme substitute therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ oly@@ sac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) .
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions that are defined as any side effects that occur during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
for this reason , these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting in which re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available .
due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients form Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the start of treatment .
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with care when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
as there is little experience in the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , the theore@@ tically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously advised .
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ ka ) to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
in the case of a mild or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
in the event of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered .
the in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in in@@ fusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with Chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interfer@@ ence with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular attachment of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists .
animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
since no data is present on new@@ bor@@ ns exposed to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase via breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
adverse events in clinical studies were mainly observed as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( duration up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years , are very common in the following table ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing stops and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) also occurred .
children Un@@ wanted drug effects associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with predominantly severe trial form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
in most patients it came to a serum version within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment . in the age of 5 patients with a more severe follow @-@ up form usually came to a serum version within one month ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over ) .
up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature withdrawal from the study ) no antibodies could be detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , among them 3 patients with whom there has never been a serum version .
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG level in urine , while a variable decrease of G@@ AG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
the presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions , although the occurrence of un@@ desirable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the en@@ umer@@ ation therapy is one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accum@@ ulative sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient restoration of enz@@ ym@@ atic activity .
after IV in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells absorbed into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely using man@@ nose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43 .
although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of disease , the majority of patients were of the mean phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype .
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( Fe@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected Fe@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me every week for 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed improvement of lung function and ability to be treated in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of Fe@@ V is clin@@ ically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the size of adults .
of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly prior to treatment 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study .
within the first 4 weeks , a clear waste of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) was observed , which remained constant until the end of the study .
in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into consideration clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy variables ( expected percentage of normal Fe@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing , motion range of the shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally no improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) .
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion ( 16 patients with severe forms and 4 with medium delay ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - Mir@@ ror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe disease ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe forms of course there were limited or no progress in cognitive development .
in a phase @-@ 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage schemes were carried out onto the G@@ AG level in urine , liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
100 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks .
the dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent .
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug will be updated .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged under 5 years was similar to that of older and less severely affected patients .
based on conventional studies on safety disease , toxic@@ ity in a once @-@ in @-@ one application , toxic@@ ity in repeated dose and reproduction toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular dangers for human beings .
since no follow @-@ up studies have been carried out , this drug may not be mixed with other medicines , except with the ones listed below 6.@@ 6 .

within the given time , the owner of the marketing authorisation process has completed the following program of studies , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report on the benefit @-@ risk ratio .
this register will record long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase is found , which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ can@@ e ) , either in a small amount before or this enzyme is absent .
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have an allergic reaction to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; &quot; &quot; an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect occurring during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) . &quot; &quot; &quot;
when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you use drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain , because there is a possible risk of dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs .
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to the application and is intended for intraven@@ ous application ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient tolerate this , gradually increase to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes .
in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ IX @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing stops and facial oils .
very common ( occurrence at more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • joint disease , joint pain , back pain , pain in the arms and legs • Er@@ rö@@ ten • fever • less oxygen in the blood • Re@@ action at the in@@ fusion site
the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the package will be updated .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( cancer drugs ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body .
ag@@ m@@ ica is used in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ o@@ therapies as sole therapy .
in order to reduce side effects , patients should receive a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during the treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 .
if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; antibody &quot; ( medicines for vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent de@@ hydr@@ ation ) should be given before or after the application of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients whose blood type changes or certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , stopped or the dose should be reduced .
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus s@@ lows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing .
the transformation of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form occurs more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural eff@@ er@@ o@@ theli@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had not received chemotherapy for their disease before .
in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study of 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , previously treated with chemotherapy , were compared with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine for cancer ) .
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine ( another anti @-@ cancer drug ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1,@@ 7@@ 25 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer .
patients treated with ap@@ li@@ ta and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin lived on average 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
in patients who had previously received chemotherapy , the average survival time was 8.@@ 3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months at doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el .
in both studies , however , patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival times in the administration of ap@@ li@@ ta than with the medication .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.@@ V. for the marketing of the European Union .
each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 m@@ l. of 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dose is removed from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer , except for predomin@@ ant plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with metastatic color@@ ec@@ tal or metastatic non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ously for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid must be given the day before and on the day of the mixed @-@ mixed gift as well as on the day after the treatment .
during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days following the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose .
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose as well as after every third action cycle .
in patients receiving p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge should be produced before each application , including a differentiation of the leu@@ ko@@ cytes and plat@@ el@@ et counting .
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ GP@@ T ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value .
a dose testing must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking account of the presence of the blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles .
after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
should patients not develop hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ level 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA until the patient has the value before the treatment
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA needs to be terminated if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reduc@@ ti@@ o- or so - in the case of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients with age 65 % or above 65 years of age , there is an increased risk of side effects .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended to all patients .
the data situation in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore , the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
however , patients with a liver function of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 times the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ times the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies .
patients need to be monitored with respect to bone metast@@ asis and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should not be given to patients before absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils have reached a value of ≥ 100 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Na@@ dir of the absolute number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological and ni@@ ec@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was be@@ ac@@ om@@ ised when a pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
therefore , all patients treated with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous intake of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
all patients prescribed for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ IDs with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ existing high blood pressure or diabetes .
for this reason , a drainage of the eff@@ lu@@ ent before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment is to be considered in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space .
5 Sever@@ al cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ b occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated live vaccine ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive ability is made by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised to seek advice on the conservation of sperm before the treatment .
in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oid@@ al anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ IDs , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g a day ) may result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects .
therefore , caution is required if high doses of N@@ SA@@ IDs or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid are applied in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clear@@ ances ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed are avoided ( see section 4.4 ) .
since no data exists regarding the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ IDs with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed .
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of co@@ ag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women but as with an@@ de@@ - ren an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed cannot be used during pregnancy except if it is absolutely necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fo@@ etus ( see section 4.4 ) .
since the possibility of ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive ability is made by means of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the commen@@ cement of the treatment to obtain advice on the blocking of the sperm cells .
it is not known whether p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma and the random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed as well as 16@@ 3 patients with mes@@ o@@ theli@@ oma who were random@@ ized to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .

clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who were random@@ ized p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , comprised sup@@ rav@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as .
clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the summari@@ zed results of three individual p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mono therapy studies , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) .
these differences are likely to be traced back to differences in patient population , as the P@@ ha@@ - se 2 studies included both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity of adverse effects that could possibly be related to the study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 Pati@@ ents with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 8@@ 30 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ abine .

serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and trans@@ it@@ ory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in acute clinical studies using p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance .
in clinical studies , patients with mixed @-@ treatment were occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ gi@@ tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal intestinal perfor@@ ation , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) .
from clinical studies , patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory failure .
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chem@@ o@@ therapeu@@ tics ( see section 4.4 ) .

the primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investig@@ ational medicine in the treatment arm ( random@@ ised and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) related to the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural retina was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) in relation to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and a wor@@ sen@@ ing of lung function over time in the control arm .
a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , open phase III study with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC advanced medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and from 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) .
an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plat@@ e@@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 9.@@ 3 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adjusted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2,@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) .
limited data from a separate random@@ ized , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 540 ) pre@@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the IT@@ T population analyses and support the non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
mean PFS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.@@ 1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3,@@ 9 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ abine C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( 95 % CI = 25,@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) .
the analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences according to hist@@ ology , see table below .
CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = intent @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = size of the total population a statisti@@ cally significant for non @-@ inf@@ eri@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ negoti@@ able limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin required less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and plat@@ el@@ et trans@@ fu@@ sions ( p = 0.00@@ 2 ) .
in addition , the patients needed the addition of er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.@@ 0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed after administration as mono@@ therapeu@@ tics were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the given dose will be found in the urine unchanged within 24 hours after the application .
p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in the plasma is 3.5 hours in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in clearing 90 ml / min ) .
in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs who received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us @-@ inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ or@@ ular changes were observed ( De@@ gen@@ ration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ zed epitheli@@ al tissue ) .
unless applied in@@ und@@ ently , the retention periods and conditions after preparation are in the user &apos;s responsibility and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and validated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions .
dissolve the content of the 100 mg blood vessels containing 4,@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preserv@@ atives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed .
the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the product .
each water bottle must be released with a 20 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .

the resulting solution is clear and the colouring varies from color@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish , without compromising the quality of the product .
it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter combined with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , low @-@ fat diet .
patients who take All@@ i and have no weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
if these enzymes are in@@ hibited , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , causing about a quarter of the fats that are added to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed to the intest@@ ine .
in a third study All@@ i was compared to placebo in 3@@ 91 obes@@ e patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
in both studies in patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo .
in the study of allergy in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no significant weight loss could be observed for patients .
the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at the anus , fl@@ are ( winds ) with a bow@@ el finish , bow@@ el strand , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( put@@ ts ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs .
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in patients with transplan@@ ts ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
it must not be used in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption ( in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or ch@@ ol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and for pregnant women or for nursing mothers .
in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union .
all@@ i is inde@@ xed for weight loss of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ the@@ or@@ ical , fatty diet .
all@@ i should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data on efficacy and safety .
as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally absorbed , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function .
hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simul@@ tane@@ ous mal@@ absorption ( see section 4.5 ) • Chr@@ onic mal@@ absorption syndrome • Chol@@ est@@ ase • pregnancy ( see section 4.6 ) • Nur@@ sing time ( see section 4.6 ) • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the lik@@ el@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) can increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
as weight loss can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients who have a diabetes medicine should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adapted if necessary .
patients who have all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these medicines needs to be adapted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnant @-@ contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ine , a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed .
in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be influenced ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical studies up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K and beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range .
however , patients should be advised to take supplements of mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparations before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) .
a marginal decrease of the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time after the administration of a single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one .
animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies of or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) and very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10.000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .
the incidence of known side effects reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some magnitude .
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring .
in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dosage , no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at .
based on tests on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at &apos;s li@@ pi@@ an@@ tic properties can be assumed .
the therapeutic effect sett@@ les in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bond to the active Ser@@ b @-@ rest of the ga@@ stri@@ an and p@@ ank@@ re@@ tic li@@ pas@@ en .
from clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks the absorption of about 25 % of the dietary fat .
two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies on adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ory , fatty diet .
the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study who lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) .
although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months .
the mean change in the Gesamt@@ ch@@ ol@@ esterin was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline : 3,@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
at waist circum@@ ference the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( initial value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.6 cm ( initial value 10@@ 3.5 cm ) .
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not meas@@ urable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 ng / ml ) .
7 In general , non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma was only spor@@ adi@@ c and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without any indication of accumulation .
two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ sed lac@@ ton@@ ring ) and M3 ( M1 after cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine @-@ group ) , were identified in a study with obes@@ e patients ( M1 after cle@@ av@@ age of the N @-@ mol@@ yl @-@ leu@@ cine @-@ group ) , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentration .
based on the conventional studies on safety har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated application , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data does not allow any particular danger to humans .
drug vig@@ il@@ ance system The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmaceutical vig@@ il@@ ance system , described in the version of July 2007 as described in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the application , will be applied before and while the product is available on the market .

please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you may notice side effects that are not indicated in this use information .
the most common side effects are associated with the mode of action of the capsules and result in increased fat from the body .
these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as you may not have consistently reduced the fat percentage in your diet .
with the following basic rules , you can learn to minim@@ ise diet @-@ related side effects : • Begin a few days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fat @-@ reduced diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favourite foods and about the size of the portions you normally take .
if you know exactly how much you eat , the lik@@ el@@ ihood that you will exceed your fat limit will decrease . • Tell your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals .
save the amount of calories and fat you are allowed to consume per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a nutri@@ tious night@@ stand , as you may have done in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people with whom these con@@ com@@ it@@ ant phenomena occur , learn to control them with time by adjusting their diet .
• Ke@@ ep out of reach of children . • Do not store more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ iry date indicated on the board . • Ke@@ ep the container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lica gel that serve to keep the capsules dry .

obesity has an influence on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • Car@@ di@@ ac disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • oste@@ o@@ arthritis Please talk to your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent the emergence of serious diseases and has a positive influence on your health .
choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat heal@@ th@@ ily .
energy is also measured in kilo@@ j@@ ou@@ les which you can also find in food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume a maximum of calories per day .
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
please refer to the information below for the amount of calories recommended for you . • D@@ ue to the capsule &apos;s mode of operation , adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial .
if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat .
by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time reduce the lik@@ el@@ ihood of con@@ com@@ it@@ ant con@@ com@@ it@@ ants . • You should try to decrease progres@@ sively and continuously .
34 This decreased cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without fru@@ stration and disappointment .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Low physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you burn up little or no daily , work in the garden or perform other physical activities . • &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; means that you burn 150 k@@ cal daily by movement , for example through 3 km walk , 30 to 45 minutes gardening or 2 km walk in 15 minutes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
• For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat goals and keep them . • Re@@ ally is a nutritional diary with information about the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a diet plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you feed cal@@ orie and fat du@@ sting and give guidelines to become more physically active .
in conjunction with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you to develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight .
it is used in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are a strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) as well as chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are the cause of nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) .
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ ic ) .
the use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group .
this means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine .
Alo@@ xi was examined in three main studies on 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong or moderate to cause nausea and vom@@ iting .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , which are strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) .
in chem@@ o@@ therapies , moderate nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) .
in comparison with dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . approval for the marketing of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy .
since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the col@@ on massage , patients should be closely monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute idi@@ ot after injection .
as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advised in the simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ t- interval is extended or which tend to such an extension .
in addition to chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting in the days following chemotherapy .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit tumor activity of the five chem@@ o@@ therapeutic agents ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ins , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) .
in a clinical study there was no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ St@@ ate@@ - Con@@ centr@@ ation oral Met@@ o@@ clo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or .
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population , it was shown that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , ch@@ ini@@ dine , ran@@ iti@@ dine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline , and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the clearing of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ ac@@ ron .
there are no experiences for the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician .
in clinical trials , the most common side effects were observed in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) associated with Alo@@ xi ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) .
very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of delivery ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post marketing reports .
the group with the highest dose showed similar abund@@ ances of adverse events as in other dosing groups ; no dose @-@ effect relationships were observed .
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not effective therapy for an Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose .
in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , 1,@@ 132 patients receiving a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mg / m2 of dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life 7.@@ 3 hours ) received intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one .
in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , 6@@ 67 patients receiving a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams Pal@@ on@@ os@@ ac@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 .
results of studies with moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summari@@ zed in the following tables .
in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron .
after the findings of pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and to extend the duration of the action potential .
the aim of the study carried out by 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ ac@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg .
res@@ or@@ ption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average termin@@ ale half @-@ life of about 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dos@@ e- propor@@ tionally in the whole dose range of 0.@@ 3@@ 90 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34 % .
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 25 mg of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) measured after one @-@ time IV administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max was higher after the one @-@ off rate of 0.@@ 75 mg .
about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor in comparison to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron .
in vitro studies on metabolism have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ ac@@ ron .
elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an unchanged active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose .
after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous bol@@ us injection in healthy patients the total length was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the terminal elim@@ inations and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ ac@@ ron are increased , but a reduction of the dose is not justified .
in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after expos@@ ures , which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use .
10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , indications were that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and re@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation and can extend the duration of action .
high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ ac@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not mice .
the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is designed for single use in humans , the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans .
the holder of this authorisation for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug in the context of this decision .

in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative report in which the announcement of approval for placing the drug prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution .
this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU ( also called the &quot; reference drug &quot; ) .
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by a viral infection ) .
in a micro@@ scopic investigation , liver tissue damages damage , and the values of the liver enzyme Alan@@ ine amin@@ otran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood ab@@ norm@@ ality are increased .
it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance .
the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon used data to demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of action , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) .
in the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 4@@ 55 patients .
the study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : mail @ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int Rem@@ over the E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is Au@@ thor@@ ised for non commercial purposes only provided by the E@@ MEA is acknowledged .
in addition , concerns were raised that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not suff@@ ice .
the number of hepatitis C patients responding to the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was reduced to more patients than the reference medicine ; moreover , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects .
in addition to this , the study used in the study was not adequately validated to determine the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) .
it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( skin infection associated with cr@@ ust formation ) and small infected in@@ fir@@ ings ( cra@@ cking or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wed wounds .
Al@@ tar@@ go is not intended to be used for the treatment of infections that have been demon@@ stra@@ bly or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lins resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because alarm against this type of infection may not work .
alt@@ ar@@ go can be used in patients with age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments .
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of the bacteria .
the main indicator of effectiveness in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients among placebo responded to the treatment .
in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at home patients , approximately 90 % of patients from both groups responded to the treatment .
in these two studies , however , it was found that Al@@ tar@@ go is not effective enough in treating ab@@ sc@@ esses ( oak @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body tissue ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA .
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation at the sur@@ facing point .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections are predomin@@ ant : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ fir@@ mi@@ ties , abra@@ sions or se@@ wn wounds .
in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the placing on the market of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union .
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in the case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irritation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ o@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is to be broken off , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected to be patho@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
in clinical studies on secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous use of retin@@ ob@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended .
due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical use on pe@@ eled skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vivo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) .
3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle retin@@ ob@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after topical application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ese o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients , dosage adjustments are not deemed necessary if topical Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors .
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
retin@@ ob@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ob@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
in deciding whether breast@@ feeding continued / or the therapy should continue with Al@@ tar@@ go , it is advisable to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that Al@@ tar@@ go have applied , the most commonly reported adverse effect was irritation at the date of delivery which concerned about 1 % of the patients .
mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ er@@ anus ) .
the mechanism of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction on a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P binding site and the pe@@ p@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase@@ center .

if , due to the local pre@@ val@@ ence of resistance , the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear obj@@ ection@@ able at least some infections , advice should be sought by experts .
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
in the case of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered .
res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % retin@@ ob@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and applied skin for up to 7 days .
out of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ o@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained .
sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 with adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however , maximum individual systemic inclusion on the human being after topical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 sha@@ ved skin ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 ng · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP in@@ hibition .
metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative Met@@ abol@@ ism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ es was medi@@ ated primarily by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ a@@ 4 , with low participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) .
in studies of oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid changes .
in @-@ vitro screening of gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ h @-@ test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes and in the rat micro@@ kernel test for in vivo study of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
there were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 sha@@ ved skin :

Ambi@@ chel@@ ia is used to treat hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases .
Ambi@@ chel@@ onia is used as part of a two @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered .
for this reason , Ambi@@ Hend@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the two doses of the vacc@@ ination plan can be brought to an end .
if a ref@@ res@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given .
&quot; &quot; &quot; vacc@@ ines act by &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; contributing &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) as it can defend itself against a disease . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ambi@@ Hend@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996 , the Twin@@ rix adults and the vacc@@ ination that has been approved since 1997 , the Twin@@ rix children .
the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are given children as part of a three @-@ dose vacc@@ ination plan .
because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that supports the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as a cover for the application of Ambi@@ rix .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
in an additional study of 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections .
at between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ grad led a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ ence &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
the most common side effects of Ambi@@ grad ( observed in more than 1 of 10 V@@ acc@@ ine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ch@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability .
Ambi@@ grad may not be used in patients who are possibly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
in August 2002 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smi@@ th@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
the standard vacc@@ ination plan with Ambi@@ diligence is composed of two doses , with the first dose being given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose .
if a booster is requested both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B , vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies originating from the combination vaccine are in the same magnitude as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
it is not yet fully assured , whether immun@@ o@@ competent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine will need a booster @-@ booster as protection , as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in case of no longer det@@ ectable antibodies .
3 As with all injection vacc@@ ines , appropriate methods of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction after the vaccine has been donated .
if a faster protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
in hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels may be reached after the pri@@ ming , so that in these cases the gift of other ino@@ cul@@ ations may be required .
since an intra@@ der@@ mal injection or intra@@ muscular administration could lead to an optimal result in the glut@@ eal muscle , these inj@@ ections should be avoided .
in the case of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or blood cl@@ ots , it can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ an@@ ically , as in these cases it can occur after intra@@ muscular administration of bleeding .
if Ambi@@ Hend@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ i , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) .
in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved .
in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ iness , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever is similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ an salt and preserv@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation .
in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ ines have been given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years .
in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years , the compatibility of Ambi@@ ence was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and quality on a basis of the calculation per ino@@ cul@@ ation dose , but not on a basis of calculation per person .
pain was observed in 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects after the gift of Ambi@@ enta , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine .
after the complete ino@@ cul@@ ation cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of the subjects who had been given Ambi@@ man@@ ia reported pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % for the subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine .
however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ality was comparable to pro gangs ( i.e. , across the entire vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects who got Ambi@@ grad , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % among the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine ) .
the frequency of pronounced pain and quality was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme .
in a comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ inations , the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ Group was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
however , a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per tape , was reported in the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds .
the proportion of vacc@@ ines that reported serious side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ grad or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different .
in clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions for anti @-@ HA@@ V were 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
anti @-@ HB@@ s &apos; ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence rates were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose which was administered for the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
7 In a comparative study , conducted at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans Ambi@@ grad and 147 were awarded the standard combination vaccine with three doses .
in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the rate of serum was significantly higher compared with Ambi@@ enta ( SP in the table below ) versus hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the three @-@ dose vaccine .
the immune responses that were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1 @-@ 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after the end of full ino@@ cul@@ ation series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
both studies received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ grad or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies was detected in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at least 24 months after the imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ diligence in the 0 @-@ 6 month vacc@@ ination scheme .
the immune response observed in this study against both anti@@ gens was comparable to that detected after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ atic A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical study at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds it could be shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ s and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ Hend@@ rix was administered at the same time with the booster of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ul@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us influ@@ enza type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient .
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions rates as for the previous formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ ing to potential foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
according to article 114 of the Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized to this purpose .

the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through virus @-@ containing foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other path@@ ways , such as bathing in water contaminated by waste waters .
you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment .
as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect itself from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vaccine has been concluded with 2 doses .
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the two V@@ acc@@ ines have been administered ( although you / your child is not yet un@@ happy or sick at the time of the vacc@@ ination ) , vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
a protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
• If an allergic reaction to ambient or any component of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) has already been shown to you / your child .
allergic reaction can manifest through it@@ ching skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If an allergic reaction has already occurred with you / your child on an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a serious infection with fever / has .
• If you want to have a quick protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the usually scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
in the case of a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the physician will advise you / your child of a vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ diligence .
instead , he / her child will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per ino@@ cul@@ ation dose ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second ino@@ cul@@ ation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vacc@@ ination protection against end of the vaccine series .
sometimes , Ambi@@ emp@@ rix will be inj@@ ected under the skin and not into the muscle in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots . • If you / your child are weakened due to illness or treatment in your body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis .
ambient can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be required to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Tell your doctor if you / your child will take further drugs ( including those that you can get without prescription ) or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been given / or this is planned in the near future .
however , in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ diligence , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as many extre@@ mi@@ ties .
if Ambi@@ Hend@@ rix is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
it is usually not given to pregnant or breast@@ feeding women , unless it is urgently necessary to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B .
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ diligence Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) for you / your child .
if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible .
very common ( more than 1 case per 10 nar@@ rated doses ) : • pain or discomfort on the insertion site or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 t@@ inn@@ ed doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Sli@@ di@@ pl@@ y@@ ness • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
other side effects that have been reported days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 ino@@ cul@@ ated doses ) are :
these include loc@@ o @-@ restricted or expan@@ sive r@@ ashes that can be it@@ ching or puff@@ ing , swelling of the eyes and the face , ag@@ grav@@ ating breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden drop of blood pressure and un@@ consciousness .

23 . inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child significantly affects or you notice side effects that are not stated in this package .
ambient is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
based on the data that has become known since the first authorization for placing on the market , the CH@@ MP stated that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ ence remains positive .
however , since ambition was brought into circulation only in one Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure .
am@@ mon@@ ary can also be used in patients with incomplete enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
- split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y hose ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach leading tube ) .
it was not a comparative study because Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps could not be compared with another treatment or placebo ( a pseu@@ do @-@ drug , that is , without drug ) .
may also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid retention , taste disturbances or taste , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ ary effectively inhi@@ bits ammon@@ ia levels in patients with ure@@ a disease .
&quot; &quot; &quot; under &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; &quot; &quot; , &quot; Am@@ mon@@ t@@ aps was approved because limited information was given to this drug at the time of approval . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients , where a complete lack of enz@@ ym@@ atic deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days of life ) .
in patients with a late manifest form ( incomplete enzyme defect that mani@@ f@@ ests after the first months of life ) there is an indication for the use , if in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy arises .
for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ule form .
the daily dose is calculated individually , taking into account protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ yl phosph@@ ate .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ ine @-@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency should receive ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cers if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately .
each dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with care in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency as well as with sodium retention and de@@ formation .
since the metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate over the liver and kidneys occurs , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure .
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons .
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and reduced number of functioning nerve end@@ ings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted into breast milk in humans , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) .
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least one adverse event ( AE ) occurred in 56 % of patients and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed to not be associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate cell , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 month old inf@@ ant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which showed dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in an intraven@@ ous dosage of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is an metabol@@ isch active compound , which is jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nitrogen .
5 Pati@@ ents with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that a sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate of 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen is produced for each gram .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started right away in order to improve survival and clinical results .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st , and the disease itself led to death in the first year of life with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues .
by means of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of ex@@ cre@@ tion of nitrogen ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ um ( but within the first life month ) to 80 % .
patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy were the survival rate of 100 % , but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
in patients with a late manifest form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the or@@ ni@@ eth@@ yl @-@ scar@@ c@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , who recovered from a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % .

phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is known to be oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine in the liver and kidney , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine produced .
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in a so@@ ber healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled studies ) .
phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and metabol@@ ites were also studied in patients with intraven@@ ous sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in tablet form , measured plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
in the majority of patients with ure@@ a @-@ cycle disturbances or hem@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day ) was not det@@ ectable in plasma the next morning after night fasting .
in three out of six patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the average phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of the con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate had no compla@@ ining effects in the rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( babies and children who still do not swal@@ low the tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gas stom@@ atitis or a nas@@ al probe .
according to the previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be kept within the normal range .
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carb@@ am@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ eth@@ yl phosph@@ ate .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , equivalent to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose .
if rat @-@ fl@@ utes were exposed before the birth Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) , it came to les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex .
a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed a metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in connection with lac@@ tate cell , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , p@@ anc@@ y@@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus
on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it is assumed that for each gram of bi@@ ased sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen is produced .
existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition may occur .
after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate in gran@@ ule form , meas@@ urable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate were found 15 minutes after ing@@ es@@ tion .
during the durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C .
in this procedure , the small measuring spoon is 0.@@ 95 g , the average measuring spoon 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate .
if a patient has to receive the medicine using a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins .
if you conduct laboratory tests , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate may affect the results of certain laboratory tests .
if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine .
during the lac@@ tation period , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may pass into breast milk and harm your baby .
in rare cases confusion , head@@ aches , taste disturbances , follow @-@ up of the hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and a deterioration of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed .
if you notice any of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or hospital in order to initiate a corresponding treatment .
if you forgot to take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal .

you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS on the same single doses or@@ ally or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ at ( hose which runs directly into the stomach through the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
31 • Take a he@@ aped spo@@ on@@ ful of gran@@ ulate from the container . • Take a straight edge , e.g. a knife bank over the upper edge of the spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The quantity remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring sco@@ op .
an@@ gi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable Ang@@ ina ( a form of chest pain with different thick@@ nesses ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; stopping &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measurement value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) .
if An@@ gi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure .
this can help in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of an@@ gi@@ ox in sole administration or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I , another drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I .
during the PCI , patients often used a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in .
in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the administration of GP@@ I - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events ( death cases , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year .
in patients undergoing a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was just as effective in all indicators as He@@ par@@ in , except for heavy bleeding where it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in .
an@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components .
it must also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , and in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attack .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that An@@ gi@@ ox is an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued approval to The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to appro@@ ve An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ arkt ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) in case of an emergency call or if an early intervention is fores@@ een .
the recommended initial dose of An@@ gi@@ ox in patients with ACS is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
if a PCI is carried out in another follow @-@ up , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose can be resum@@ ed from 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements .
an indication of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation .
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a single captive bolt of an@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt input of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should take place .
in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicinal product should be carefully mixed prior to use and the captive bolt dose should be administered quickly intraven@@ ously .
once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly .
in patients with moderate kidney function ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din against ACS ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used .
if the ACT value lies below 225 seconds , a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt will be reviewed again .
in patients with moderate kidney damage , included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which resulted in approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds .
3 In case of patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients An@@ gi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low molecular he@@ par@@ in .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or ir@@ reversible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding , especially if bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is given in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
even if the majority of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges occur at the arter@@ ial points of the arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion in PCI patients , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) can , in principle , occur bleeding all over the world .
in patients who are taken War@@ far@@ in and treated with a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din again reaches the level of treatment .
starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( he@@ par@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , thro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators ) , it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding .
in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological ha@@ em@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored .
in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , delivery or post@@ nat@@ al development are inadequate ( see section 5.3 ) .
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to bio @-@ vali@@ ru@@ din alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for heavy bleeding like in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and heavy ble@@ ed@@ ings were significantly less frequent among Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the groups with He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and bio @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ - inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
an AC@@ U@@ ITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following : intra@@ arter@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the insertion zone , which requires a radi@@ ological or surgical intervention , reduction of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in level ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood station , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products for trans@@ fusion .
other , less frequently observed blood loc@@ al@@ isations occ@@ uring at more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; spots , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose , or throat .
the following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group as well as in the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges were significantly less frequent among Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din than in the comparative group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
the following side effects listed above have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are group@@ ed in table 6 according to system organ classes .
in the case of over@@ dosage , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is immediately abor@@ ted and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding .
An@@ gi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific th@@ rom@@ bo@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center and the an@@ ion @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in the cl@@ ots .
the binding of the bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to th@@ rom@@ bo@@ in , and with it its effect , is reversible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine slowly spl@@ its the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thereby re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
in addition , a bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din with serum from patients with which in the past had come to he@@ par@@ asi@@ tic th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ indu@@ ci@@ zed th@@ rom@@ bo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) did not indu@@ ce a plat@@ el@@ et ag@@ gregation reaction .
in healthy volunteers and in patients , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din shows a dose of dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation , which is evi@@ den@@ ced by the pro@@ long@@ ation of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT .
if a PCI was carried out below , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h .
in arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or en@@ ox@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with unstable Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ Heb@@ ungs@@ inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in Arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or prior to the start of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or the PCI .
in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients who required angi@@ ography in 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms .
about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients submitted within 72 hours of angi@@ ography .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic characteristics of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din were evaluated in patients undergoing per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) and in patients with ACS .

A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from the age of six with diabetes who require a treatment with insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot handle insulin effectively .
insulin secre@@ is@@ ine is very slightly different from human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter time of action than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type 2 diabetes , where the body cannot effectively re@@ work insulin , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study of 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set .
in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin delivery was observed after six months .
in adults with type 2 diabetes , the lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin inj@@ ect@@ ins or any of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood glucose levels .
in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH to appro@@ ve A@@ pi@@ dra &apos;s placing in the European Union .
A@@ pi@@ dra can be used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall , the th@@ igh or the delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the abdom@@ en area .
because of reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced .
any change of activity , brand ( heart rate ) , insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zinc @-@ ret@@ ar@@ ded etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin demand .
3 . inadequate dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , may cause hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life threatening .
changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage .
the timing of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is changed .
these include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ cont@@ ent@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , dis@@ op@@ y@@ pyramid , fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ ene , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide @-@ antibiotics .
in addition , the symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation can be under@@ estimated under the effects of symp@@ a@@ thetic agents such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ e@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine .
animal experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human@@ insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
it is not known whether insulin secre@@ tion occurs in human breast milk but insulin is not absorbed in breast milk nor is absorbed after oral use .
listed below are the adverse drug interactions known from clinical trials ( ≥ 1 / 10 ; often : ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally : ≥ 1 / 100 ; &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 100 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 100 ; not known ( frequency based on available data is not predictable ) .
cold welding , cool and pale skin , ti@@ redness , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ ors , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , lack of concentration , drow@@ sin@@ ess , excessive dog , changes in vision , headache , nausea , and pal@@ pit@@ ations .
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy If the injection unit changes continuously within the injection area , a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy can occur at the injection site .
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) given by a correspon@@ dingly trained person , or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a physician .
after glu@@ ing , the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes .
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ aneous GA@@ - be of insulin @-@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hu@@ g normal insulin .
in a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in showed a dose of proportional glu@@ ing effect in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosage range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg , as well as a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human@@ insulin .
insulin secre@@ tion has a twice as rapid response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than a human insulin .
from the data it was obvious that at an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post @-@ pran@@ dial gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal .
if insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was dug in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ pran@@ dial control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal .
if insulin dischar@@ ges in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 million nu@@ des before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the meal began ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) .
insulin L@@ ul@@ is@@ in for 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the start of the meal compared to the human standard insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the start of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
