<seg id="1">This document is a summary of the European Public Authorities Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="2">If you require further information about your illness or treatment, please read the leaflet (also part of the EPAR) or contact your doctor or pharmacist.</seg>

<seg id="4">It is available as a 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of enamel tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml).</seg>
<seg id="5">B. wirh thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusions; • Bipolar I disturbance, a mental illness, in which patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal upswing) alternating with periods of normal temperament.</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat severe to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick monitoring of increased unrest or behavioural disturbances when oral consumption of the medication is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">In both diseases, the solution can be used for insertion or melting tablets in patients who are experiencing difficulty swallowing tablets.</seg>
<seg id="9">In patients who take other medicines at the same time as they are broken down like Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted.</seg>
<seg id="10">"" "this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" "" "neurotransmitters" "", "i.e. chemical substances that enable communication between nerve cells." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">"" "Ariadprazole is probably mainly known as" "" "partial agony" "" "for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin)." ""</seg>
<seg id="12">This means that, like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, Aripiprazole acts as the neurotransmitter to activate the receptors.</seg>
<seg id="13">Since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole helps to normalize the activity of the brain, thereby reducing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence.</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies of up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of the injection solution was compared in two studies with 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased unrest over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">In another study Abilify was compared over 12 weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence, to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with abilify.</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder that suffered from increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">In all studies the changes in the symptoms of patients were examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and absorbs (absorbs) the solution.</seg>
<seg id="20">In both studies with the injection solution, patients who received abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg gave a significantly stronger reduction in the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="21">In the treatment of bipolar disorder Abilify reduced manic symptoms more effectively than placebo in four of five short-term studies.</seg>
<seg id="22">In addition, Abilify prevented more effective than placebo for recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses were also more effective than placebo experienced the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">The most common side effects of abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrollable), athlete (drowsiness), somnolence (drowsiness), drowsiness (nausea), obstipation (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety.</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and of medium to severe manic episodes in bipolar I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who predominantly spoke of manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Ariadprazole versus the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">In addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural problems in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate, compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the marketing of Abilify in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Ariadprazole (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once a day regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">Increased effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose.</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">Efficacy of abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">With regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors warrant this (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="34">If the CYP3A4 Inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Ariadprazole dosage should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="35">The occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic disorders and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after a change of an anti-psychotic therapy, even in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no increased risk of suicide with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, hypostasis, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="38">3 Spätdyskinesia: in clinical studies lasting a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="39">If symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia are observed in a patient treated with abilify, it should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or cancel the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="40">If a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a MNS, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of MNS, all anti-psychotics, including abilify, must be discontinued.</seg>
<seg id="41">This is why Ariadprazole should be used with care in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in states associated with seizures.</seg>
<seg id="42">56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazole in patients with psychosis associated with Alzheimer's disease had an increased risk of death in comparison to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="43">However, there was in one of these studies, a study with fixed dosage, a significant relationship between dosage and response to adverse cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="44">Hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including abilify.</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia-related adverse events associated with abilify and other atypical anti-psychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">Polythipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients suffering from diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="47">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyles lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="48">Due to the primary effect of Ariadprazole on the central nervous system, caution is required if Aripiprazole is used in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="49">The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="50">In a clinical study with healthy volunteers a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="51">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="52">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') Metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 Extensive Metabolisers.</seg>
<seg id="53">Considering the common gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, may have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="55">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose amount before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or esitalopram) or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be dosed together with a moderate increase in Ariadprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">In clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextrometamorphan / 3-methoxymorphinan-Ratio), 2C9 (Omebozol) and 3A4 (Dextrometamorphan).</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or are pregnant during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">This drug may not be used in pregnancy because of insufficient data protection for humans and because of the concerns raised in the animal reproductive studies, unless the potential use justifies the potential risk for the foetus.</seg>
<seg id="60">However, as with other anti-psychotics, patients should be warned of using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Ariadprazole has no negative influence on them.</seg>
<seg id="61">The following adverse events were more common (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*):</seg>
<seg id="62">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined by the following criteria: common (&gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (&gt; 1 / 1,000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="63">Schizophrenia - In a controlled long-term study of 52 weeks, a total decreased incidence (25.8%) of EPS including Parkinsonism, Akathisie, Dystonia and dyskinesia occurred in patients treated with haloperidol (57.3%).</seg>
<seg id="64">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="65">In another controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 14.8% in patients treated with Aripiprazole and 15.1% in patients with oselzapine therapy.</seg>
<seg id="66">Manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 23.5% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 53.3% in patients under haloperidol treatment.</seg>
<seg id="67">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium.</seg>
<seg id="68">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="69">A comparison between the patient groups among Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="70">Increases in CPK (creatine-phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="71">Side effects reported in connection with antipsychotic therapy and the incidence of the treatment with Aripiprazole include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="72">In clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosages with Aripiprazole alone were observed in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths.</seg>
<seg id="73">Although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of overdose because Aripiprazole exhibits high plasma retention.</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazole in schizophrenia and bipolar I disturbance on the combination of a partial antagonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a-receptors is mediated.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D2- and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HTA and 5HT2a-receptor as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4, serotonin 5HT2 and 5HT7-, to alpha-1-adrenergic and to the histamine-H1receptor.</seg>
<seg id="76">In dosages of Aripiprazole in dosages ranging from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy volunteers, positron emission tomography showed a dose-dependent reduction in binding of 11C-Racloprid, a D2 / D3 receptor ligands, at the nucleus caudatus and on the puttest.</seg>
<seg id="77">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="78">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of responder patients enrolled in the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="79">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets including PANSS and the Montgomery Asmine depression rate showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="80">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse was seen for Aripiprazole, which was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="81">In an Ovizapine controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients have a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible doses over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder, Aripiprazole showed superiority to placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy trial for 3 weeks with fixed dose with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disruption, Aripiprazole showed no superior efficacy against placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">In two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, Aripiprazole showed a efficacy in week 3 versus placebo, comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12.</seg>
<seg id="85">In addition, Aripiprazole showed a similar percentage of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania in week 12, such as lithium or haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="86">In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not apply to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="87">10 In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a long-term extension phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazole prior to randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar relapse, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="88">Based on in vitro studies the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the dehydration and hydroxyylation of Aripiprazole, the N dealkylamation is catalyzed by CYP3A4.</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean Elimination period is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazole on extensive metabolites via CYP2D6 and approximately 146 hours in 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites via CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">In Aripiprazole there are no differences in the pharmacokinetic between male and female healthy volunteers, as did a pharmacokinetic examination of schizophrenic patients no sex-related effects.</seg>
<seg id="91">A specific analysis of the pharmacokinetics showed no clinically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">A single dose study in subjects with different liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function on the pharmacokinetic of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity.</seg>
<seg id="94">Based on conventional studies on safety disease, toxicity in repeated application, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data had no particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="95">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans, so they have only limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the mean Steady State exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (the 10x of the mean-time-state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="97">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of the hydroxy- metabolites by Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean Steady State exposition (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="98">However, the concentrations of the sulphate conjugate from Hydroxy- Aripiprazole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found no more than 6% of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the gall of apes, and are far below the limit values (6%) of the in vitro solubility.</seg>
<seg id="99">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages leading to expositions of 3 and 11x of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="144">Once it is clinically appropriate, the treatment should be terminated with Ariadprazole injection solution and commenced with the oral application of Ariadprazole.</seg>
<seg id="145">In order to increase the resorption and minimize variability, an injection into the M. deltoideus or deep into the Gluteus maximus muscle is recommended by bypassing obese regions.</seg>
<seg id="146">A lower dose of 5.25 mg (0.7 ml) can be given depending on the individual clinical status, taking into account the drug used for maintenance or acutely therapy (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="147">If a further oral treatment with Ariadprazole is indicated, see the summary of the features of the drug to Abilify tablets, Abilify melting tablets or Abilify solution.</seg>
<seg id="148">There are no studies on the effectiveness of Ariadprazole injection solution in patients with agility and behavioural disorders caused by schizophrenia and manic episodes of bipolar-I disorder.</seg>
<seg id="149">If parenteral therapy with benzodiazepines is considered necessary in addition to the Aria prazole injection solution, patients should be observed with regard to extreme sedation or a blood pressure drop (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="150">Studies on the safety and efficacy of Ariadprazole injection solution are not available for patients suffering from alcohol or drug poisoning (by prescribed or illegal drugs).</seg>
<seg id="151">Aripiprazole should be used with care in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, hypostasis, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including celerated and malignant form).</seg>
<seg id="152">Spätdyskinesia: in clinical trials that lasted a year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="153">Clinical manifestations of a MNS are high fever, muscle stiffness, changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous instability (irregular pulse or blood pressure, tachycardia, sweating and irregular heartbeat).</seg>
<seg id="154">Polythipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients suffering from diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be regularly monitored regarding a worsening of glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="155">Weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects or an unhealthy lifestyles lead to serious complications.</seg>
<seg id="156">Nevertheless, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to the sole administration of Aripiprazole, in a study involving healthy subjects Aripiprazole (15mg dosage) as one-off intramuscularly and which simultaneously received Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="157">105 The H2 antagonist famotidine, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the resorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant.</seg>
<seg id="158">In CYP2D6 'poor' (= 'poor') metabolites the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="159">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV- protease inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar doses should be performed.</seg>
<seg id="160">After replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dose amount before the start of the adjuvant therapy.</seg>
<seg id="161">106 Lorazepam (2 mg dosage) intramuscularly received, the intensity of sedation was greater compared to that after sole administration of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="162">The following side effects were more common in clinical trials with Aripiprazole injection solution (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="163">The frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria: (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="164">107 The following side effects were more likely to occur (≥ 1 / 100) than placebo, or were classified as possible medically relevant side effects (*) in clinical trials with oral applied Aripiprazole (see section 5.1):</seg>
<seg id="165">In a placebo-controlled long-term study of 26 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 19% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 13.1% in patients with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="166">In another study of 12 weeks, the incidence of EPS was 26.6% in patients suffering from Aripiprazol- treatment and 17.6% for those under lithium-treatment.</seg>
<seg id="167">In the long-term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo-controlled study, the incidence of EPS was 18.2% for patients suffering from Aripiprazole treatment and 15.7% for patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="168">A comparison between the patient groups among Aripiprazole and placebo, in which potentially clinically significant changes in the routinely controlled laboratory parameters did not reveal any medically significant differences.</seg>
<seg id="169">Increases in CPK (creatinphosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed in 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="170">Side effects related to an anti-psychotic therapy, and also reported during the treatment with Aripiprazole, include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="171">110 and behavioural disturbances was the Ariadprazole injection solution associated with statistically significant major improvements of agility / behavioural disorders compared to placebo and was similar to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="172">In a placebo-controlled short-term study (24 h) with 291 patients with bipolar disorder as well as agility and behavioural disorders, the Ariadprazole injection solution was associated with a statistically significant improvement in symptoms of agility and behavioural disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Loraepam- reference arm.</seg>
<seg id="173">The median improvement of the initial value on the PANSS Excitement Component score was 5.8 for placebo, 9.6 for Lorazepam and 8.7 for Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="174">In analyses of subgroups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe agility, a similar effectiveness in relation to the population population was observed, but a statistical significance could be observed due to a reduced number of patients.</seg>
<seg id="175">In three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) of 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazole (oral) showed statistically significant improvement in psychotic symptoms compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="176">In a haloperidol-controlled study, in week 52 the proportion of responder patients enrolled in the study medication was similar in both groups (Aripiprazole 77% (oral) and haloperidol 73%).</seg>
<seg id="177">Current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets, including PANSS and the Montgomery-Asberg depression rate, showed a significantly stronger improvement compared to haloperidol.</seg>
<seg id="178">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, a significantly higher reduction in the rate of relapse was observed for Aripiprazole (oral), which was at 34% in the Aripiprazole (oral) group and at 57% below placebo.</seg>
<seg id="179">In an Ovizapine controlled, multinational double blind study with schizophrenia over 26 weeks, which included 314 patients and in which the primary study objective was' weight gain ', significantly fewer patients had a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the initial value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg at an average weight of ca.</seg>
<seg id="180">111 In a placebo-controlled study for 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some cases did not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the accompanying therapy with Aripiprazole revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproate.</seg>
<seg id="181">In a placebo-controlled study for 26 weeks followed by a 74-week study extension in manic patients who achieved remission with Aripiprazole before randomisation, Aripiprazole showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar disorder, mainly in the prevention of a relapse into the mania.</seg>
<seg id="182">In the first 2 hours after intramuscular injection, the AUC Ariadprazole is 90% larger than the AUC after having received the same dose as a tablet; systemic exposure was similar between the two formulations.</seg>
<seg id="183">In 2 studies with healthy volunteers the mean time was 1 to 3 hours after the maximum plasma level reached.</seg>
<seg id="184">The administration of Ariadprazole injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target organ after repeated application in a systemic exposure (AUC), which was 15- and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intramuscularly.</seg>
<seg id="185">In studies on reproductive toxicity after intravenous application there was no safety concern after maternal exposure, which was 15- (rats) and 29 times (rabbits) above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg.</seg>
<seg id="186">Based on conventional studies with Aripiprazole (oral) for safety disease, toxicity in repeated application, reproduction toxicity, genotoxicity and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data could not identify any particular dangers for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="187">Toxicologically significant effects were observed only in dosages or expositions which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure in humans; therefore, they have limited or no meaning for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="188">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady-state exposure (AUC) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day (10 times the average steady-state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>
<seg id="189">In addition, a cholelithiasis was observed as a result of the precipitation of the hydroxy- metabolites of Aripiprazole in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day (1 to 3 times the mean steady-state-exposure (AUC) at the recommended clinical dose or the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2).</seg>
<seg id="190">In rabbits, these effects were observed after dosages, leading to exposures of 3 and 11-fold of the mean steady-state AUC at the recommended clinical maximum dose.</seg>

<seg id="267">The efficacy of Abraxane was studied in a major study involving 460 women with metastatic breast cancer, of which about three quarters previously had an anthracycline.</seg>
<seg id="268">The effect of Abraxane (in sole administration or as monotherapy) was compared to the drug containing a conventional paclitaxel (given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects).</seg>
<seg id="269">Overall, in the main study 72 (31%) of the 229 treated with Abraxane were treated to the treatment, compared to 37 (16%) of the 225 patients receiving conventional paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="270">Considering only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer, there was no difference between the drugs in relation to the efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival.</seg>
<seg id="271">On the other hand, in patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer, they showed that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel medication.</seg>
<seg id="272">It should not be used in patients who have low neutrophils in the blood before treatment.</seg>
<seg id="273">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) found that Abraxane was more effective than conventional paclitaxel containing medicines and that in contrast to other medications contained in paclitaxel it must not be given with other medicines to reduce side effects.</seg>
<seg id="274">In January 2008, the European Commission granted Abraxis BioScience Limited to the company Abraxane in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="275">Abraxane-monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first-line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and is not indicated for standard anthracycline-containing treatment (see also section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="276">In patients with severe neutropenia (neutrophils &lt; 0.50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer) or severe sensory neuropathy during the Abraxane therapy, the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in the subsequent series.</seg>
<seg id="277">In sensory neuropathy grade 3 the treatment is to be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to Grade 1 or 2, and in all subsequent cycles the dose must be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="278">There is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dosage adjustment in patients with mild to moderate impairment of liver function (see section 4.4. and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="279">There were no studies with patients with impaired renal function and there is currently no sufficient data to recommend dose adaptation in patients with impairment of kidney function (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="280">Abraxane is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to lack of data for safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="281">Abraxane is a albumin-bound nanoparticle formulation of Paclitaxel that could have significantly different pharmacological characteristics than other formulations of Paclitaxel (see section 5.1 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="282">If an allergic reaction occurs, the medicine should be stopped immediately and a symptomatic treatment is initiated, and the patient must not be treated again with paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="283">In the patients no renewed Abraxane treatment cycles should be initiated until the neutrophils increase again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thrombocyte count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l.</seg>
<seg id="284">Patients with severe liver function disorders (bilirubin &gt; 5 x ULN or ASL / ALT &gt; 10 x ULN) should not be treated with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="285">While a cardiotoxicity associated with Abraxane has not been proven, cardiac incidents in the indexed patient population are not unusual, especially in patients with previous anthracycline treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease.</seg>
<seg id="286">If there is nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea in the patients after the application of Abraxane, they can be treated with the usual antiemetic and constiptive means.</seg>
<seg id="287">Abraxane should not be used in pregnant women or in childbearing age, who do not practice effective contraception, except for the treatment of the mother with paclitaxel is unavoidable.</seg>
<seg id="288">Women in childbearing age should use a reliable contraceptive method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="289">Male patients treated with Abraxane are advised to not give birth to a child during and up to six months after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="290">Male patients should be advised of a sperm retention before the treatment, since the treatment with Abraxane is the possibility of irreversible infertility.</seg>
<seg id="291">Abraxane can cause side effects such as fatigue (very common) and dizziness (often) that can affect the transport ability and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="292">The following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated with 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane once every three weeks in pivotal clinical phase III study.</seg>
<seg id="293">Neutropenia was the most prominent haematological toxicity (reported in 79% of patients) and was quickly reversible and dose-dependent; leukopenia was reported in 71% of patients.</seg>
<seg id="294">Anemia (Hb &lt; 10 g / dl) was observed in 46% of patients treated with Abraxane and was severe in three cases (Hb &lt; 8 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="295">Table 1 shows the side effects that have occurred in combination with the dosage of Abraxane as monotherapy in every dose and indication in studies (N = 789).</seg>
<seg id="296">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10); occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100); rare (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000); very rare (≥ 1 / 10); very rare (≥ 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="297">Occasionally: increased blood pressure, weight gain, increased lactate hydrogenase in the blood, increased creatine in the blood, increased blood sugar, increased phosphorous in the blood, reduced potassium in the blood heart disease:</seg>
<seg id="298">Dysphagia, flatulence, tongue burn, dry mouth, pain of gums, loose stools, oesophagitis, pain in the lower abdomen, sores in the mouth, oral pain, rectal bleeding diseases of the kidneys and urinary tract:</seg>
<seg id="299">Pain in the chest wall, weakness of muscles, neck pain, abdominal pain, muscle spasms, pain in skeletal muscles, neck pain, discomfort in the limbs, muscle weakness very common:</seg>
<seg id="300">Restlessness 1 The frequency of hypersensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definite in the case in a population of 789 patients</seg>
<seg id="301">As these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice, no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no causal connection with these events has been established.</seg>
<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an Antimilotubules active ingredient that promotes the storage of microtubules from the tubules and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their depolymerisation.</seg>
<seg id="303">This stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions.</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that Albumin mediates the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel through endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60 albuman receptor and a paclitaxel accumulation in the area of the tumour due to the albumbinding protein SPARC (flarted protein acidic rich in cysteine).</seg>
<seg id="306">The application of Abraxane for metastatic breast carcinoma is supported by data from 106 patients in two one-arm unlinked studies and 454 patients treated in a randomized Phase III comparative study.</seg>
<seg id="307">In a study, 43 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma were treated with Abraxane, which was given in the form of an infusion for over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg. / m2.</seg>
<seg id="308">In the second study, a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as infusion for 30 minutes in 63 patients with metastatic breast carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="309">This multicenter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a monotherapy with paclitaxel every 3 weeks, either in the form of a solution containing adjuvant paclitaxel (N = 225) or in the form of Abraxane 260 mg / m2 as a 30-minute infusion without pre-medication (N = 229).</seg>
<seg id="310">In the study, 64% of patients had a compromised general condition (ECOG 1 or 2), 79% had visceral metastases and 76% had more than 3 metastases.</seg>
<seg id="311">14% of patients had previously received chemotherapy, 27% had adjuvant chemotherapy, 40% only for metastasis and 19% due to metastasis and adjuvant treatment.</seg>
<seg id="312">9 The results for the overall response rate and time to progression of the disease as well as progression-free survival and survival for patients who receive first-line therapy are presented below.</seg>
<seg id="313">Neurotoxicity compared to paclitaxel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients experiencing a peripheral neuropathy grade 3 at a time during the therapy.</seg>
<seg id="314">The natural course of peripheral neuropathy for decay in baseline due to the cumulative toxicity of Abraxane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and remains unknown.</seg>
<seg id="315">The pharmacokinetic of the total Paclitaxel after 30- and 180-minute infusion of Abraxane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials.</seg>
<seg id="316">The Exposure Exposure Exposure (AUC) increased linearly from 2653 to 16736 ng.h / ml analogously to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2.</seg>
<seg id="317">10 After the intravenous dosage of Abraxane to patients with metastatic breast carcinoma in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2, the plasma-paclitaxel plasma concentration decreased in multiphase mode.</seg>
<seg id="318">The medium distribution volume was 632 l / m2; the high distribution volume indicates far-reaching extra-vascular distribution and / or soft binding of Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="319">In a study with patients with advanced solid tumours, the pharmacokinetic properties of Paclitaxel were compared to intravenous 30-minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane with the values after a 3-hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent containing Paclitaxel.</seg>
<seg id="320">The Clearance of Paclitaxel was higher after the Abraxane-Gabe (43%) than after a solution-containing Paclitaxel injection, and also the distribution volume was higher at Abraxane (53%).</seg>
<seg id="321">In published literature on in vitro studies of human liver microsome and tissue layers, paclitaxel is metabolized primarily to 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and to two smaller metabolites (3 "-p hydroxylitaxel and 6α -3" -p-Dihydroxypaclitaxel).</seg>
<seg id="322">After a 30 minute infusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abraxane in patients with metastatic breast carcinoma, the mean value was 4% of the given total dose with less than 1% of the total dose of 6α -hydroxypaclitaxel and 3 "-p hydroxypaclitaxel, which indicates far-reaching non-renal clearance.</seg>
<seg id="323">However, only a few data is available for patients at the age of over 75, as only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmacokinetic analysis.</seg>
<seg id="324">The chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and protected from light light over 8 hours.</seg>
<seg id="325">Paclitaxel is a cytotoxic anticarcinogenic medicine and, as with other potentially toxic substances, should be observed when dealing with Abraxane.</seg>
<seg id="326">Using a sterile syringe, 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml (0.9%) sodium chloride infusion solution is injected into an Abraxane-flow-bottle over a period of at least 1 minute (0.9%).</seg>
<seg id="327">After complete application of the solution, the bottle should rest for at least 5 minutes in order to ensure a good wetting of the solid.</seg>
<seg id="328">Then the bottle should be slowly and carefully swivelled and / or inverted for at least 2 minutes until complete resussuspension of the powder is performed.</seg>
<seg id="329">If precipitation or sinking substances are visible, the water bottle must again be gently inverted in order to achieve complete resussuspension prior to the application.</seg>

<seg id="358">• Training brochure • Summary of the characteristics of the medicine (technical information), labelling and packaging material. • With a clear picture of the correct application of the product, cooling boxes for transport by the patients.</seg>
<seg id="359">This means that seamed is similar to a biological medicine already approved in the European Union (EU) and contains the same active ingredient (also called "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="360">Patients with normal blood vessels are used in which complications may occur in connection with blood transfusion, if a blood loss is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,800 ml is expected.</seg>
<seg id="361">The treatment with abseamed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated.</seg>
<seg id="362">In patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood donors, abseamed is injected into a vein.</seg>
<seg id="363">The injection can also be performed by the patient or his caregiver, provided that they have received appropriate instructions.</seg>
<seg id="364">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency or in patients receiving chemotherapy, the hemoglobin values should always be in the recommended range (between 10 and 12 grams per deciliter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children).</seg>
<seg id="365">The iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency, and iron supplements should be administered during the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="366">In patients receiving chemotherapy, or in patients with kidney problems, anaemia may be caused by an erythropoitic deficiency, or that the body does not adequately address the body's erythropoietin.</seg>
<seg id="367">Erythropoietin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood loss.</seg>
<seg id="368">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="369">Abseamed was compared to the reference drug when administered as an injection into a vein as part of a major study involving 479 patients suffering from kidney problems.</seg>
<seg id="370">All patients participating in this study had been injected at least eight weeks of Eprex / Erypo before they were either converted to seamed or continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="371">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in hemoglobin values between the beginning of the study and the evaluation period in weeks 25 to 29.</seg>
<seg id="372">The company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of the skin-injected abseamed were examined with those of Eprex / Erypo in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="373">In the study of patients suffering from kidney problems, the haemoglobin values of patients who were reamed to seamed were maintained to the same degree as those patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="374">In comparison, patients who continued to receive Eprex / Erypo showed an increase of 0.063 g / dl of the initial value of 12.0 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="375">The most common side effect of abseamed is a rise in blood pressure, which can occasionally lead to symptoms of encephalopathy (brain problems) such as sudden, smelly migraine headaches and confusion.</seg>
<seg id="376">Abseamed may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to epoetin alfa or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="377">Abseamed as injections under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems as further studies are needed to ensure that this does not trigger allergic reactions.</seg>
<seg id="378">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that for seamed in accordance with the regulations of the European Union, evidence has been demonstrated that the medicine has a comparable quality, safety and efficacy profile such as Eprex / Erypo.</seg>
<seg id="379">The company, which has amed down amed, will provide information packages for medical professionals in all Member States, including information on the safety of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="380">In August 2007, the European Commission granted approval to the company Medice medicinal Pütter GmbH & Co KG for placing of seamed across the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="381">Treatment of anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adults with solid tumours, malignant lymphomas or multiple myeloma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of transfusion is due to the general condition (e.g. cardiovascular status, preexisting anaemia at the beginning of chemotherapy).</seg>
<seg id="382">The treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate anemia (hemoglobin [Hb] 10 - 13 g / dl [6,2 - 8,1 mmol / l], if blood saving measures are not available or insufficient, in case of planned larger operational procedures which require a large volume of blood (4 or more units of blood in women; 5 or more units of blood in men).</seg>
<seg id="383">For the reduction of external blood, abseamed can be applied before a large elective orthopaedic intervention in adults with no iron deficiency, in which a high risk of transfusion complications can be expected.</seg>
<seg id="384">HB 10-13 g / dl) and expected blood loss of 900-1800 ml may not be applied to an autologous blood donation program.</seg>
<seg id="385">The hemoglobin target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl (6,2 - 7.5 mmol / l), except for pediatric patients where the haemoglobin concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl (5.9 - 6.8 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="386">Symptoms of anaemia and symptoms may vary depending on age, sex and overall disease; therefore, the physician is required to evaluate the individual clinical course and condition of the disease.</seg>
<seg id="387">A rise in haemoglobin by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) over a period of four weeks should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="388">Due to the variability between patients, individual hemoglobin values can occasionally be observed over or below the haemoglobin- target concentration.</seg>
<seg id="389">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="390">If the haemoglobin value increases by more than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month or if the permanent hemoglobin value exceeds 12 g / dl (7.5 mmol / l), the epoetin alfa dose can be reduced by 25%.</seg>
<seg id="391">Patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that epoetin alfa is used at the lowest approved dose, which is necessary for the control of anaemia and the symptoms of anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="392">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than those in which initial anaemia is less severe (Hb &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="393">The clinical results suggest that patients with initially very low Hb value (&lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4,25 mmol / l) may need higher maintenance doses than those with initial anaemia which is less severe (Hb &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.25 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="394">Starting dose 50 I.U. / kg three times a week by intravenous application, if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.U. / kg (three times a week) until the desired target value is reached (this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="395">Symptoms of anaemia and - sequelae may vary depending on age, gender and overall disease; therefore, the physician's assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is necessary.</seg>
<seg id="396">Given this hemoglobin variability, a corresponding dose management should be tried to achieve haemoglobin target concentration of 10 g / dl (6,2 mmol / l) to 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="397">Patients should be closely monitored to ensure epoetin alfa is used at the lowest approved dose which is necessary for controlling the symptoms of anaemia.</seg>
<seg id="398">If after 4 weeks of treatment the hemoglobin value has risen by at least 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) or the Retiulocyte number ≥ 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, the dose of 150 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.E. / kg once a week.</seg>
<seg id="399">If the hemoglobin increase &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) and the Retiulocyte number &lt; 40,000 cells / µl is increased compared to the initial value, the dose should be raised to 300 I.E. / kg three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="400">If after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.E. / kg the haemoglobin value ≥ 1 g / dl (≥ 0,62 mmol / l) or the number of retication is ≥ 40,000 cells / µl, the dose of 300 I.E. / kg should be maintained three times a week.</seg>
<seg id="401">If the hemoglobin value has risen by &lt; 1 g / dl (&lt; 0.62 mmol / l) or the Retiulocyte number by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl compared to the initial value, an approach to epoetin alfa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be broken off.</seg>
<seg id="402">Patients with mild anemia (hematocrit 33 - 39%), in which the precautionary storage of ≥ 4 blood confoils is required, in a dose of 600 I.E. / kg body weight should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery.</seg>
<seg id="403">Iron substitution should start as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the start of the autologous blood donation program - to provide large iron reserves before the start of the seamed treatment.</seg>
<seg id="404">6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.U. / kg epoetin alfa which should be given once weekly for three weeks (day 21, 14 and 7) before surgery and on the day of surgery (day 0).</seg>
<seg id="405">Epoetin alfa should be given preoperatively 300 I.E. / kg each 10 consecutive days, on the day of the surgery as well as 4 days immediately afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="406">Alternatively injection can be given at the end of dialysis via the hose of a fistula, followed by 10 ml of isotonic saline solution to flush the hose and ensure adequate injection of the medicine in the circulation.</seg>
<seg id="407">Patients suffering from erythroblaconia (Pure Red Cell Aplasia, PRCA) under treatment with any erythropoietin should not receive a seamed or other erythropoietin (see section 4.4 - erythroblastompie).</seg>
<seg id="408">Heart attack or stroke within one month before the treatment, unstable angina pectoris, increased risk of deep venous thrombosis (e.g. venous venous thromboembolism).</seg>
<seg id="409">In patients who are intended for a larger elective orthopaedic surgery and who cannot participate in an autologous blood donation program, the application of epoetin alfa is contraindicated in the following pre-, accompanying or underlying diseases: severe coronary heart disease, peripheral arterial occlusion, vascular disease of the carotia or cerebrovascular disease; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cerebrovascular event.</seg>
<seg id="410">Erythroblaconia (PRCA) Very rare was reported on the occurrence of an antigen-mediated PRCA after months of treatment with subcutaneous erythropoetin.</seg>
<seg id="411">In patients with sudden loss of function, defined as reduction of the haemoglobin values (1 - 2 g / dl per month) with increased need for transfusions, the retication value should be determined and the usual causes for a failure (iron, folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminium oxidation, infections or inflammations, blood loss and hemolysis) should be investigated.</seg>
<seg id="412">If the reptikulocyte value, taking into account anaemia (i.e. the reticutural "index"), is degraded (&lt; 20.000 / mm3 or &lt; 20.000 / microliter or &lt; 0.5%), the thrombocyte and leukocyte numbers are normal, and if no other cause of an active loss is found, the anti-erythropoetin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone marrow to the diagnosis of a PRCA should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="413">The data on immunogenicity in subcutaneous use of abseamed in patients with a risk for anemia-induced PRCA (patients with renal anaemia) are not sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="414">8 In case of patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration, recommended under Section 4.2, should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="415">Clinical trials witnessed an increased risk of mortality and risk for serious cardiovascular events when erythropoic-stimulating agents (ESA) were given with a haemoglobin target concentration of more than 12 g / dl (7,5 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="416">Controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the ability of epoetins when the haemoglobin concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control anaemia symptoms and the prevention of blood transfusions.</seg>
<seg id="417">The increase in haemoglobin should be about 1 g / dl (0.62 mmol / l) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) per month in order to minimize the risk of increased blood pressure.</seg>
<seg id="418">In patients with chronic renal insufficiency and clinically evident coronary heart disease or congestive insufficiency, the upper limit of the haemoglobin target concentration, recommended under Section 4.2, should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="419">According to the present findings, the treatment of anaemia with epoetin alfa in adults with renal insufficiency, which are not yet dialysis, does not accelerate the progression of renal insufficiency.</seg>
<seg id="420">In tumour patients with chemotherapy, a 2-3-week delay between epoetin alfa and the erythropoetin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the treatment efficiency of epoetin alfa (patients who may have to be transfused).</seg>
<seg id="421">If the Hb increase is greater than 2 g / dl (1.25 mmol / l) a month or a Hb value of 13 g / dl (8,1 mmol / l), the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 to minimize the risk of possible thrombotic events (see Section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy-related anemia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping hemoglobin value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl).</seg>
<seg id="422">The decision to use recombinant erythropoetins should be based on benefit-risk weighing involving the patient's involvement, which should also take into account the specific clinical context.</seg>
<seg id="423">Patients who are supposed to undergo a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should, if possible, investigate the cause of anaemia prior to epoetin alfa therapy.</seg>
<seg id="424">Patients undergoing a larger elective orthopaedic surgery should receive adequate thrombosis prophylaxis, since they have an increased risk of thrombotic and vascular diseases, especially in case of underlying cardiovascular disease.</seg>
<seg id="425">In addition, it is not possible for patients with epoetin alfa to have an increased risk of postoperative thrombotic / vascular events with epoetin alfa for patients with an initial amoglobin value of &gt; 13 g / dl.</seg>
<seg id="426">In several controlled studies, epoetine has not been proven to improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression in tumour patients with symptomatic anemia.</seg>
<seg id="427">4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy, haemoglobin target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl (7.5 - 8.7 mmol / l) was targeted</seg>
<seg id="428">If epoetin alfa is used together with Ciclosporin, the blood levels should be controlled by Ciclosporine and the Ciclosporin dose should be adapted to the rising haematocrit.</seg>
<seg id="429">In vitro studies on tumor tissues do not result in an interaction between epoetin alfa and G-CSF or GM-CSF regarding hematological differentiation or proliferation.</seg>
<seg id="430">Thrombotic, vascular events such as myocardial ischemics, myocardial infarcts, cerebrovascular events (cerebral haemorrhage, cerebral infarction), deep venous thromboses, pulmonary thrombosis, aneurysms, retinalthromboses, and 11 blood clots in artificial kidneys has been reported in patients with epoetin alfa.</seg>
<seg id="431">The most common side effect during treatment with epoetin alfa is a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hypertension.</seg>

<seg id="574">The second study included 2 127 male and women with osteoporosis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip fracture; the number of fractures was studied over a period of up to five years.</seg>
<seg id="575">In the case of Morbus Paget, Aclasta was tested in two studies in a total of 357 patients and compared with the risedronate (another bisphosphonate) for six months.</seg>
<seg id="576">The main indicator of effectiveness was whether the content of the alkaline phosphatase in serum (an enzyme that decomposes bone substance) in the blood once again normalized or decreased by at least 75% compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="577">In the study of older women, the risk of vertebrate fractures in patients under Aclasta (without osteoporosis therapies) was reduced by 70% over a period of three years compared to the patients.</seg>
<seg id="578">Compared to all patients under Aclasta (with or without other osteoporosis therapies) with those taking placebo the risk of hip fractures reduced by 41%.</seg>
<seg id="579">In the study of men and women with hip fracture, 9% of patients under Aclasta had a fracture (92 of 1 065) compared to 13% of the patients taking placebo (139 of 1 062).</seg>
<seg id="580">Most of Aclasta's side effects occur within the first three days after infusion and are less frequent in repeated infusions.</seg>
<seg id="581">Aclasta must not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonate or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="582">As with all bisphosphonates, patients at Aclasta are subject to the risk of kidney problems, reactions to the infusion site and osteonekrose (the death of bone tissue) in the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="583">Aclasta's manufacturer provides reconnaissance material for physicians who prescribe acetate for the treatment of osteoporosis, which contains indications how to use the medicine, as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="584">In April 2005, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novartis Europharm Limited to approve Aclasta's placing in the European Union.</seg>

<seg id="586">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women and in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="587">The patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include: • Contract infection • Contract infection in pregnancy and breastfeeding women • Required of adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D, appropriate physical activity, non smoking and a healthy diet • Important signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to take back medical or nursing assistance</seg>
<seg id="588">Osteoporosis treatment in postmenopausal women • in men with increased risk of fractures, including patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture.</seg>
<seg id="589">For the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis and osteoporosis in men, an intravenous infusion of 5 mg Aclasta is recommended once a year.</seg>
<seg id="590">In patients with a low-traumatic hip fracture, the administration of the infusion of acetone is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip fracture (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="591">For the treatment of the Morbus Paget, Aclasta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in treating the Morbus Paget.</seg>
<seg id="592">After a treatment of the Morbus Paget with Aclasta, a long remission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="593">In addition, it is highly advisable in patients with Morbus Paget an adequate intake of calcium, equivalent to twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the gift of Aclasta (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="594">In patients with a recently diagnosed low-traumatic hip fracture, an initial dose of 50,000 to 125,000 I.U. is recommended orally or intra-muscular vitamin D before the first Aclasta infusion.</seg>
<seg id="595">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen just after the application of Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="596">Patients with kidney function disorder (see section 4.4) For patients with a creatinin clearance &lt; 35 ml / min, Aclasta is not recommended as there are limited clinical experiences for this group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="597">Older patients (≥ 65 years) A dose adaptation is not necessary because bioavailability, distribution and elimination in older patients are similar to younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="598">Children and adolescents Aclasta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 because data on safety and efficacy are missing.</seg>
<seg id="599">Aclasta is not recommended in patients with severe renal insufficiency (creatinin-clearances &lt; 35 ml / min) because only limited clinical experiences are available for this patient population.</seg>
<seg id="600">Pre-existing hypokaltsemia should be treated with acetate before starting the therapy with adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="601">Due to the rapid implementation of the effect of zoledronic acid on the bone structure, a temporary, sometimes symptomatic hypokaltsemia can develop, whose maximum occurs within the first 10 days after the infusion of Aclasta (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="602">In addition, it is highly advisable to provide a sufficient amount of calcium for patients with Morbus Paget twice daily, at least 500 mg. of elementary calcium, for at least 10 days after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="603">Cancer, chemotherapy, treatment with corticosteroids, poor oral hygiene should be examined before applying bisphosphonates with appropriate preventive dentistry.</seg>
<seg id="604">For patients who require dental procedures, no data is available whether the break-up of the treatment with bisphosphonates reduces the risk of osteonecrosis in the jaw area.</seg>
<seg id="605">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="606">The frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after the administration of Aclasta can be reduced by offering paracetamol or ibuprofen just after the application of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="607">The incidence of serious adverse events reported by atrial fibrillation was increased (1.3%) (51 of 3,862) compared to patients who received placebo (0.6%) (22 from 3,852).</seg>
<seg id="608">In osteoporosis studies (PFT, HORIZON - Recurrent Fracture Trial) the total frequency of atrial fibrillation between Aclasta (2.6%) and placebo (2.1%) was comparable.</seg>
<seg id="609">Very common (≥ 1 / 100, ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rare (≥ 1 / 10,000, &lt; 1 / 1,000) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1.</seg>
<seg id="610">Renal dysfunction of zoledronic acid was associated with renal dysfunction, which was associated with decrease of renal function (i.e. an increase in serum creatinins) and in rare cases as acute renal failure.</seg>
<seg id="611">The changes in the creatinin clearance (measured annually before administration) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as impaired renal function were comparable in a clinical study for osteoporosis over three years between the acetylene and the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="612">A temporary increase in serum creatine within 10 days of the treatment was observed at 1.8% of patients treated with Aclasta versus 0.8% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="613">Based on the assessment of laboratory findings, temporary asymptomatic calcium levels stood at 2.3% of patients treated with Aclasta in a large clinical trial compared to 21% of patients treated with Aclasta in the Morbus Paget trials.</seg>
<seg id="614">All patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the postmenopausal osteoporosis study in the study to avoid clinical fractures after a hip fracture and in the Morbus Paget trials (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="615">In the study on preventing clinical fractures after a recently received hip fracture, vitamin D levels were not routinely measured, but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of Aclasta (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="616">Local reactions following the administration of zoledronic acid in a large clinical study were reported on local reactions to the infusion site, such as redness, swelling and / or pain (0.7%).</seg>
<seg id="617">Osteonecrosis in the jaw area has been reported, especially in cancer patients, about osteonecrosis (primary in the jaw area), which were treated with bisphosphonates, including zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="618">Many of these patients had signs of local infections including osteomyelitis, and the majority of reports relate to cancer patients following tooth extraction or other dental intervening.</seg>
<seg id="619">7 patients with 7,736 patients met osteonecrose in the jaw area with a patient treated with Aclasta and a placebo-treated patient.</seg>
<seg id="620">In the case of overdosing, which leads to clinically relevant hypokalemia, a balance can be achieved by adding oral calcium and / or an intravenous infusion of calcium gluconate.</seg>
<seg id="621">Clinical effectiveness in the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (PFT) The efficacy and safety of Aclasta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in postmenopausal women (7,736 women between 65 and 89 years) with either a bone density (BMD) -T-Score for the lower neck &lt; -2.5 with or without signs of an existing vertebral fracture.</seg>
<seg id="622">Effects on morphometric tissue fractures Aclasta decreased significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or several new spinal fractures (see Table 2).</seg>
<seg id="623">Patients from 75 years old and older had a 60% reduced risk of spinal fractures compared to placebo patients (p &lt; 0.0001).</seg>
<seg id="624">Effects on hip fractures Aclasta showed a constant effect over three years, which resulted in reduced risk of hip fractures in a 41% (95% CI, 17% to 58%).</seg>
<seg id="625">Effect on bone density (BMD) Aclasta increased bone density at lumbar spine, hip and distal radius compared to placebo treatment significantly at all times (6, 12, 24 and 36 months).</seg>
<seg id="626">9 Increase the bone density of the lumbar spine by 6.7%, the total hip by 6.0%, the lower leg by 5.1% and the distal radius by 3.2%.</seg>
<seg id="627">Bone histology In the case of 152 postmenopausal osteoporotic patients treated with Aclasta (N = 82) or placebo (N = 70), bone biopsies from the pelvic area were taken one year after the third annual dose of bone biopsies.</seg>
<seg id="628">A microcomputer tomography (µCT) analysis showed patients treated with Aclasta compared to placebo an increase in the trabecular bone volume and the preservation of the traditional bone architecture.</seg>
<seg id="629">Bone turnover markers The bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), the N-terminal propeptide of the serum and the beta-C telopeptide (b-CTx) in serum were determined in subgroups of 517 to 1,246 patients in intervals during study duration.</seg>
<seg id="630">After 12 months, the treatment with an annual 5 mg dosage Aclasta significantly reduced BSAP by 30% compared to the initial value and was held at 28% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="631">P1NP was significantly reduced by 61% below the baseline value after 12 months and was kept at 52% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="632">B-CTx was significantly reduced by 61% below baseline value after 12 months and was held at 55% below the baseline for up to 36 months.</seg>
<seg id="633">Vitamin D levels were not routinely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D (50,000 to 125,000 I.U. of oral or intramuscular) 2 weeks prior to infusion.</seg>
<seg id="634">The total mortality was 10% (101 patients) in the treated group treated with Aclasta compared to 13% (141 patients) in the placebo group.</seg>
<seg id="635">Effect on bone mineral density (BMD) In the HORIZON-RFT study, the Aclasta treatment increased the BMD at all points in comparison to placebo treatment compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="636">The Aclasta treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo for an increase in BMD by 5.4% at the overall level and by 4.3% at the leg of the leg.</seg>
<seg id="637">Clinical effectiveness in men In the HORIZON-RFT study, 508 men were randomised and in 185 patients the BMD was judged after 24 months.</seg>
<seg id="638">The study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical fractures in men; the incidence of clinical fractures was 7.5% in Aclasta-treated men compared to 8.7% in placebo.</seg>
<seg id="639">In another study in men (study CZOL446M2308), the once annual administration of acetone compared to the once weekly gift of Alendronate was not inferior to the percentage change of the lumbar vertebrae BMD after 24 months compared to the baseline value.</seg>
<seg id="640">Clinical effectiveness of the treatment in the Paget of the bone Aclasta was investigated in patients with radiologically approved, predominantly light to moderately severe pathogen Paget of the bone (mean serum levels of alkaline phosphatase according to the 2,6fold to 3,0fold age-specific upper normal value in the study).</seg>
<seg id="641">11 The effectiveness of an infusion of 5 mg. of zoledronic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of risedronate once a day for 2 months was proved in two six months comparative studies.</seg>
<seg id="642">In the combined results, a similar decrease in pain and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the initial value for acetone and risedronate.</seg>
<seg id="643">Patients who were classified as responder at the end of the six-month study could be included in a follow-up phase.</seg>
<seg id="644">From the 143 patients treated with Risedronat and the 107 patients who participated in the follow-up study, the therapeutic response to 141 of patients treated with Risedronat could be maintained at an average duration of the follow-up phase of 18 months after the application.</seg>
<seg id="645">One-time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting infusion of 2, 4, 8 and 16 mg. of citric acid in 64 patients yielded the following pharmacokinetic data, which proved to be dose-independent.</seg>
<seg id="646">After that the plasma level quickly decreased to &lt; 10% of the maximum value after 4 hours and &lt; 1% after 24 hours, followed by a long-lasting phase of very low concentration, no more than 0.1% of the maximum value.</seg>
<seg id="647">Rapid biphasic disappearance from the large cycle with half-life t ½ = 0,24 and t ½ β 1,87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination interval t ½ g 146 hours.</seg>
<seg id="648">The early distribution phases (α and β, with the above 1 ½ -values) presumably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and excretion through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="649">In the first 24 hours there are 39 ± 16% of the administered dose in the urine, while the rest is mainly bonded to bone tissue.</seg>
<seg id="650">The total body clearance is 5.04 ± 2.5 l / h independently of the dose and remains unaffected by sex, age, race or body weight.</seg>
<seg id="651">An extension of the infusion time from 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the zoledron acid concentration by 30% at the end of the infusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve (plasma concentration over time).</seg>
<seg id="652">A diminished clearing of metabolized substances metabolized by Cytochrom P450 enzymes is unlikely because zoledronic acid is not metabolized in humans and because they are a weak or no direct and / or irreversible, substance-dependent inhibitor of the P450-</seg>
<seg id="653">Special patient groups (see section 4.2) The renal clearance of the zoledronic acid correlated with the creatinin clearing, 75 ± 33% of the creatinin clearance, and was 84 ± 29 ml / min in the 64 examined patients (range 22 to 143 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="654">This results in a slight (cr = 50 - 80 ml / min) and a moderate kidney function down to a creatinin clearing up to 35 ml / min does not require a dose adjustment of the zoledronic acid.</seg>
<seg id="655">As for severe renal dysfunction (creatinin- clearances &lt; 30 ml / min) only restricted data are available, no statements are possible for this population.</seg>
<seg id="656">Acute toxicity The highest non-letally active intravenous single dose was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and 0.6 mg / kg body weight in rats.</seg>
<seg id="657">For studies on dogs single doses of 1.0 mg / kg (based on the AUC-6fold of the recommended human-therapeutic exposure) were administered over a period of 15 minutes, good and without a renal influence.</seg>
<seg id="658">Chronic and chronic toxicity In studies with intravenous application, the renal tolerability of zoledronic acid in rats was administered by taking doses of 0.6 mg / kg as a 15 minute infusion in 3-day intervals, a total of 6 times (a cumulative dose which corresponds to the 7x of the human-therapeutic exposure related to the AUC).</seg>
<seg id="659">In long-term studies with repeated exposure to cumulated expositions which exceeded the maximum of intended human exposure, toxicological effects in other organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and the liver, as well as at the intravenous injection point were observed.</seg>
<seg id="660">The most frequent disease in trials with repeated use was an increased primary Spongiosa in the Metaphysis of the long bones of animals in the growth phase with almost all dosages, a finding that reflects the pharmacological, anti-resorptive effect of the substance.</seg>
<seg id="661">In rats one observed teratogenicity in dosages from 0,2 mg / kg as outer and internal (visceral) abnormalities and such of the skeleton.</seg>
<seg id="662">No teratogenic effects or embryo-fetal effects were observed in rabbits, although the maternal toxicity was imprinted at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of the lower serum calcium level.</seg>
<seg id="663">If the medicine is not used immediately, the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application; normally, 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded.</seg>

<seg id="671">Zoledronic acid is a representative of a class of substances called bisphosphonates and is used to treat osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the osteoporosis in men and the bone Paget of the bone.</seg>
<seg id="672">Decreasing blood levels of sex hormones, especially estrogens made from androgens, play a role in the gradual loss of bone mass observed in men.</seg>
<seg id="673">With the Morbus Paget the bone structure takes place too fast, and new bone material is constructed unordered, which makes the bone material weaker than normal.</seg>
<seg id="674">Aclasta counteracts as it normalizes the bone structure, thereby ensuring a normal bone formation and thus adding strength to the bone.</seg>
<seg id="675">If you are in a dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery, tell your doctor that you are treated with Aclasta.</seg>
<seg id="676">If you use Aclasta with other medicines, please inform your doctor, pharmacist or nursing staff if you use / use other medicines or have taken / used recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="677">It is especially important for your doctor to know if you take drugs that are known to damage the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="678">When using Aclasta together with food and drink, you are concerned that you take sufficient liquid before and after treatment with Aclasta in accordance with your doctor's instructions.</seg>

<seg id="686">Before cessation of treatment with Aclasta If you are considering the termination of treatment with Aclasta, please take notice of your next doctor's appointment and discuss this with your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="687">Side effects associated with the first infusion perform very often (in more than 30% of patients), but less frequently after subsequent infusion.</seg>
<seg id="688">Fever and chills, muscle or joint pain and headache, occur within the first three days following the administration of Aclasta.</seg>

<seg id="749">Abstract of the EPAR for the public This document is a summary of the European Public Authorities Report (EPAR), which explains how the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has evaluated the trials conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes medicine) is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="751">It may also be applied to metformin in patients (in particular overweight patients) that cannot be adequately adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerated dosage.</seg>
<seg id="752">In combination with sulfonyl resins or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl resins or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of acetylresine (low blood sugar), except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfonyl resins or insulin should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="753">This means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level sinks, making type 2 diabetes better.</seg>
<seg id="754">In more than 1 400 patients the efficacy of Actos in tripletherapie was investigated; patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonylurea, in addition, they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years.</seg>
<seg id="755">The studies measured the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c) indicating how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="756">Actos lead to a lowering of the HbA1c value, suggesting that the blood sugar levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg and 45 mg.</seg>
<seg id="757">At the end of the trial study, the effect of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulfonylurea revealed a 0.94% reduction in HbA1c, while the additional administration of placebo led to a decrease of 0.35%.</seg>
<seg id="758">In a small study, in which the combination of Actos and insulin was studied in 289 patients, patients receiving Actos also reported a reduction in HbA1c levels of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in the patients who also took placebo.</seg>
<seg id="759">The most common side effects associated with Actos were impaired vision, upper respiratory tract infections, weight gain and hypotheses (decreased sensitivity to stimuli).</seg>
<seg id="760">Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high level of ketone levels - acid levels - in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients where metformin is not indicated.</seg>
<seg id="762">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to Takeda Europe R & D Centre Limited to authorize the transport of Actos throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="763">"" "the tablets are white to whitish, round, arched and carry on one side the marking" "" "15" "" "and on the other side the inscription" "" "Actos" "". "" ""</seg>
<seg id="764">Pioglitazone is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, whose blood sugar is insufficiently discontinued with insulin and where metformin is inappropriate due to contraindications or intolerance (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="765">No data is available for the use of pioglitazone in patients under 18 years of age, therefore the application in this age group is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="766">In patients with at least one risk factor (e.g. previous heart attack or symptomatic coronary artery disease), the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose.</seg>
<seg id="767">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain or edema, especially those with reduced cardiac reserve.</seg>
<seg id="768">Patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and edema when Pioglitazone is used in combination with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="769">A cardiovascular Outcome study with pioglitazone in patients under 75 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease was performed.</seg>
<seg id="770">In this study, there was an increase in the reports of heart failure, which, however, did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study.</seg>
<seg id="771">In patients with increased enzyme levels (ALT &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range) or with other signs of liver disease, pioglitazone may not be used.</seg>
<seg id="772">If the ALT levels are increased up to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range, the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible.</seg>
<seg id="773">If a patient develops symptoms that point to a hepatic dysfunction, such as unexplained nausea, vomiting, abdominal discomfort, tiredness, loss of appetite and / or dark urine, liver enzyme levels must be checked.</seg>
<seg id="774">The decision to continue the treatment of the patient with Pioglitazone should be conducted by clinical evaluation until the laboratory parameters have been submitted.</seg>
<seg id="775">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, a dose-dependent weight gain has been proven, which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid retention.</seg>
<seg id="776">As a result of hemodilution, a slight reduction in the mean hemoglobin values (relative reduction by 4%) and hematocrits (relative reduction by 4.1%) occurred under the treatment with Pioglitazone.</seg>
<seg id="777">Similar changes were observed in comparative controlled studies with pioglitazone in patients under metformin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 3.6-4.1%) and to a lesser extent in patients with sulfonyl resins and insulin (relative reduction of hemoglobin by 1-2% and haematocrit by 1-3.2%).</seg>
<seg id="778">As a result of increased insulin sensitivity, patients who receive pioglitazone as oral two- or three-cavity combination therapy with a sulfonylurea or two-fold combination therapy with insulin are the risk of high dose-dependent hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="779">After the market launch, treatment with thiazolidindia, including pioglitazone, was reported on the occurrence or worsening of diabetic macular edema with a decrease in visual acuity.</seg>
<seg id="780">It is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pioglitazone and the occurrence of macular edema, but prescribed doctors should be aware of the possibility of macular edema when patients report about disorders of vision; a suitable ophthalmological examination should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="781">In a summary analysis of adverse events regarding bone fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients treated with pioglitazone</seg>
<seg id="782">The calculated fracture incidence was 1.9 fractures per 100 patient years in women treated with pioglitazone and 1.1 factures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="783">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occured in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="784">Patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires a pregnancy or this occurs, the treatment is deprecated (see section 4.6).</seg>
<seg id="785">Studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pioglitazone does not exercise relevant effects on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="786">Interactions with medicines that are metabolized by these enzymes, such as oral contraceptives, cyclosporine, calcium channel blocker and HMGCoA reductase inhibitors are not to be expected.</seg>
<seg id="787">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8- inhibitor) resulted in an increase of the AUC from Pioglitazone by 3 times.</seg>
<seg id="788">The simultaneous application of Pioglitazone with Rifampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) resulted in a reduction of the AUC by Pioglitazone by 54%.</seg>
<seg id="789">This is due to the fact that in the treatment with Pioglitazone the hyperinsulinemia resulting in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal are diminished and thereby the availability of metabolic substrates for the fetal growth is reduced.</seg>
<seg id="790">Very common &gt; 1 / 10; frequently &gt; 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 10000, &lt; 1 / 1000; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000, individual cases: unknown (not to be estimated from this data).</seg>
<seg id="791">These lead to a temporary change of the turbine and the refractive index of the lens, as observed with other hypoglycaemic agents.</seg>
<seg id="792">In clinical studies with pioglitazone, ALT climbs above three times the upper limit of the normal range were similar to those of placebo, but less often than in comparison groups under metformin or sulfonyl resins.</seg>
<seg id="793">In an outcome study in patients with advanced macrovascular disease, the frequency of severe heart failure in patients with pioglitazone was 1.6% higher than placebo, if Pioglitazone or respectively.</seg>
<seg id="794">Since the market launch rarely has been reported about cardiac insufficiency under Pioglitazone, but more often, if Pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="795">A summarizing analysis of adverse events with regard to bone fractures from randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical studies over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,100 patients was carried out in groups treated with pioglitazone and over 7,400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="796">In the ProActive study conducted over a period of 3.5 years, fractures occurred in 44 / 870 (5.1%) of patients treated with pioglitazone compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="797">When taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days, then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms appeared.</seg>
<seg id="798">Pioglitazone appears to activate activated Receptor-γ (PPAR-γ) activated via an activation of specific nuclei receptors (PPAR-γ), which results in increased insulin sensitivity of liver, fat and skeletal muscle cells in the animal model.</seg>
<seg id="799">It could be shown that Pioglitazone reduces glucosal production in the liver and increases peripheral glucoseverlasty in the event of insulin resistance.</seg>
<seg id="800">A clinical study with pioglitazone versus Gliclacide as monotherapy has been continued over two years in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect (defined as HbA1c ≥ 8.0% after the first 6 months of treatment).</seg>
<seg id="801">At the time after two years of therapy, blood sugar control (defined as HbA1c &lt; 0%) could be maintained by Pioglitazone at 69% of the treated patients (compared to 50% of patients under Gliclacide).</seg>
<seg id="802">In a placebo-controlled study of over 12 months, patients whose blood sugar was insufficiently discontinued with insulin despite three months of optimisation were randomised to pioglitazone or placebo.</seg>
<seg id="803">In patients with pioglitazone, the mean HbA1c was reduced by 0.45% compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin; a reduction in insulin dosage in the group treated with Pioglitazone was observed.</seg>
<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazone (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small, 18-week study of type 2 diabetics.</seg>
<seg id="806">In most clinical studies, compared to placebo, a reduction in total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as slight but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels were observed.</seg>
<seg id="807">In clinical trials over a period of up to two years, pioglitazone compared to placebo, metformin or Gliclacide reduce the total matrix glycerides and free fatty acids and elevated the HDL cholesterol level.</seg>
<seg id="808">In comparison to placebo, no statistically significant increase in LDL cholesterol was observed under Pioglitazone whereas lower values were observed under metformin and Gliclacide.</seg>
<seg id="809">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the poets triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, this both on the triglyceride level and the hepatic triglyceride synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="810">In the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and advanced macrovascular disease were randomised in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to the already existing antidiabetic and cardiovascular treatment.</seg>
<seg id="811">After oral application, Pioglitazone is absorbed quickly, with the peak concentrations of immutable pioglitazone in plasma usually 2 hours after application.</seg>
<seg id="812">On this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative efficacy of M-II is minimal.</seg>
<seg id="813">In interaction studies, it has been demonstrated that Pioglitazone does not have a relevant effect on the pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics of digoxin, warfarin, phenprocoumon and metformin.</seg>
<seg id="814">The simultaneous application of pioglitazone with gemfibrozil (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inhibitor) or with rifiampicin (a cytochrome P450 2C8 inductor) increases or lowers the plasma concentration of Pioglitazone (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="815">After oral application of radioactively marked pioglitazone in humans the marker was found mainly in the rotting (55%) and to a lesser extent in the urine (45%).</seg>
<seg id="816">The mean plasma elimination time of immutable pioglitazone is 5-6 hours in humans, and the total active metabolites are 16 - 23 hours.</seg>
<seg id="817">The plasma concentrations of Pioglitazone and its metabolites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers, but the rates of oral clearance of the mother's substance are similar.</seg>
<seg id="818">In toxicological studies in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, plasma volume enlargement with hemodilution, anemia and reversible excentric heart hypertrophy occurred in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="819">This is due to the fact that, under treatment with Pioglitazone, the hyperinsulinemia resulting in the formation decreases and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal, thereby reducing the availability of metabolic substrates for fetal growth.</seg>
<seg id="820">In long-term studies (up to 2 years) increased independencies of hyperplasia (in male and female rats) and tumors (in male rats) of the urinary bladder were induced.</seg>
<seg id="821">In an animal model of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), treatment with two other thiazolidindia resulted in increased frequency of colon tumors.</seg>

<seg id="824">In the ProActive study, a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events, fractures occured in 44 / 870 (5.1%; 1.0 fractures per 100 patient years) of patients treated with pioglitazone, compared to 23 / 905 (2.5%; 0.5 fractures per 100 patient years) in patients treated with a comparative medication.</seg>
<seg id="825">In another study for two years, the effects of a combination therapy of metformin with either pioglitazone or Gliclaze were investigated.</seg>
<seg id="826">In clinical trials over 1 year, a statistically significant decrease of albumin / creatinin quotients was statistically significant compared to baseline data.</seg>
<seg id="827">In a study of more than 20 weeks, pioglitazone not only reduced the poets triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial elevated triglyceride level, this both on an effect on tryglyceride level absorption as well as the hepatic tryglicerid synthesis.</seg>
<seg id="828">Although the study failed to determine its primary endpoint, which was a combination of the total mortal, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, acute coronary syndrome, leg amputation above the ankle, coronary revascularization and revascularization of the leg arteries, the results suggest that with the intake of Pioglitazone no cardiovascular long-term risks are connected.</seg>

<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice a day when a rapid initial action combined with a longer lasting effect is desired.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds in order to ensure that the entire dose has been injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">Patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly by intensified insulin therapy may be able to change the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly.</seg>
<seg id="874">Any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, human insulin or insulin analog) and / or manufacturing method (due to recombinant DNA towards insulin of animal origin) may cause a change in dosage.</seg>
<seg id="875">If a dose adjustment is required when switching to acetone in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the changeover.</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycaemic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycemia were less pronounced or different than previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">Before travelling across multiple time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his physician, as such journeys may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times.</seg>
<seg id="878">Therefore, the doctor must consider possible interactions during the therapy and always ask his patients for other medicines.</seg>

<seg id="886">Hypoglycemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycaemia can be treated by oral supply of glucose and sugary foods.</seg>
<seg id="887">Diabetics should therefore always have grape sugar, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Weight hypoglycemias with unconsciousness are treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) by an unbalanced auxiliary person or by glucose administered intravenously by the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="888">The effect starts within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration of the action is up to 24 hours.</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The absorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast resp. delayed resorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of fissures (hydrolysis) locations on the human insulin molecule were taken into consideration; none of the metabolites formed by the split is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">Based on the conventional studies on safety disease, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data do not allow any particular dangers to humans.</seg>
<seg id="892">It is recommended - after removing the acetone from the refrigerator - the temperature of the insulin at room temperature (not above 25 ° C) before it is resuspended according to the instructions for use for the first use.</seg>

<seg id="1177">The most common side effects of Adenoic (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) include headache, diarrhea, nausea (nausea), rash and abnormal liver enzymes.</seg>
<seg id="1178">In particular in patients with heart problems in pre-history, there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1179">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the lowering of the uric acid level in the blood was more effective than allopurinol, but could also increase the risk of side effects related to the heart and blood vessels.</seg>
<seg id="1180">Treatment of chronic hyperuricaemia in diseases that have already led to primordial deposits (including a current or current gout node and / or arthritis).</seg>
<seg id="1181">If the serum acid level is still &gt; 6 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) after 2-4 weeks, a dose increase can be taken into account on ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1182">In patients with severe renal dysfunction, efficacy and safety have not yet been fully investigated (creatine clearing &lt; 30 ml / min, see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1183">Children and adolescents As there are no experiences in children and adolescents, the use of febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1184">Since organ transplant recipients do not have any experience, the use of febuxostat in this group of patients is not recommended (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1185">Cardiovascular diseases In patients with ischemic heart disease or decompensated heart failure, treatment with febuxostat is not recommended (see Section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1186">As with other drug-containing medicines, acute gout attacks can occur during the treatment, because the lowering of serum acid levels can initially mobilize uric acid deposits in the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="1187">B. for malignant diseases and their treatment, Lesch- Nyhan-syndrome), the absolute concentration of Xanthin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a deposit in the urinary tract.</seg>
<seg id="1188">Liver diseases During phase 3 clinical trials slight abnormalities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with Febuxostat (3.5%).</seg>
<seg id="1189">It is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the start of the febuxostasis treatment and in the further course depending on the clinical findings (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1190">Theophylline Zwar did not conduct AC studies on Febuxostat, but it is known that the XO inhibition can lead to a rise in theophyll lens (an inhibition of the metabolism of theophylline was also reported for other XO inhibitors).</seg>
<seg id="1191">In subjects the simultaneous administration of Febuxostat and naproxen is 250 mg twice daily with a rise in febuxostature exposure (Cmax 28%, AUC 41% and t1 / 2 26%).</seg>
<seg id="1192">In clinical trials, the application of naproxen or other NSAR / Cox-2 inhibitors was not associated with a clinically significant increase in adverse events.</seg>
<seg id="1193">Colchicin / indometacin / hydrochlorothiazide / warfarin febuxostat can be used together with Colchicin or Indometacin, without the need for a dose adjustment for febuxostat or the other active ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="1194">In a study with subjects 120 mg ADENURIC 1 x daily a mean 22% increase in the AUC of Desipramine, a CYP2D6 substrate, suggesting a possible weak inhibitory effect of Febuxostat on the CYP2D6 enzyme in vivo.</seg>
<seg id="1195">Antazida It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an antacids containing magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide contains the absorption of febuxostat (about 1 hour) and a decline in the Cmax by 32%, but no significant change in the AUC.</seg>
<seg id="1196">Pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregnancies do not include side effects of febuxostat on pregnancy or the health of the fetus / newborn.</seg>
<seg id="1197">Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development or birth (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="1198">Patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle, operating machines or when performing hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that ADENURIC does not adversely affect their performance.</seg>
<seg id="1199">In comparison to the Allopurinol group in the pivotal study phase 3 (1,3 versus 0.3 events per 100 patient years) and in long-term extension studies (1.4 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years), a numerically higher incidence of cardiovascular events was observed, although no statistically significant differences were found and no causal connection with Febuxostat could be detected.</seg>
<seg id="1200">The risk factors identified in these patients were an arteriosclerotic disease and / or a myocardial infarction or a decompensated heart failure in the medical history.</seg>
<seg id="1201">Frequent (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasional (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100) and rare (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000) side effects that could arise in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of febuxostat and which were reported in all cases of febuxostat treatment groups more than once were listed below.</seg>
<seg id="1202">Diarrhea, nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated with colchicin at the same time. * * In clinical studies no serious rashes or severe hypersensitivity reactions were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1203">7 Open longterm extension studies In the open long term extension studies 906 patients were treated for up to 1 year, 322 patients up to 2 years, 57 patients were treated with Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg for up to 4 years.</seg>
<seg id="1204">The related events reported during long-term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies (see Table 1).</seg>
<seg id="1205">The following treatment-related events were reported more than once in all cases of Febuxosta- treatment groups and occurred in patients who received Febuxostat 80 mg / 120 mg in long-term extension studies (up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,900 patient years).</seg>
<seg id="1206">The following treatment-related events were either not reported at all in the pivotal studies of Phase 3 or at a lower frequency:</seg>
<seg id="1207">Diabetes, hyperlipidemia, insomnia, hypesthesia, conspicuous ECG, coughing, shortness of skin, skin discoloration, skin lesions, erectile dysfunction, increase in blood potassium concentration in the blood, increase in the number of lymphocytes, decrease in the number of white blood cells.</seg>
<seg id="1208">The mechanism of action uric acid is the end product of purinmetabolism in humans and arises in the context of the reaction cascade Hypoxanthin → Xanthin → uric acid.</seg>
<seg id="1209">Febuxostat is a potent, non-purin-selective inhibitor of the XO (NP-SIxO) with a Ki-value for the in vitro inhibition that lies below the nanomolar range.</seg>
<seg id="1210">Clinical trial results The efficacy of ADENURIC was shown in two pivotal studies of Phase 3 (APEX study and FACT study as described below), which were conducted with 1,832 patients with hyperuricaemia and gout.</seg>
<seg id="1211">In each study, the primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with the last three month specific serum acid levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="1212">Placebo (n = 134), ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily (n = 269), ADENURIC 240 mg 1 x daily (n = 258) for patients with a serum creatine value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1213">The APEX study showed the statistically significant superiority of both treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventionally used doses Allopurinol 300 mg (n = 258) / 100 mg (n = 10).</seg>
<seg id="1214">The FACT study showed statistically significant superiority of the treatment with ADENURIC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as ADENURIC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the traditionally used dose of Allopurinol 300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Patients with serum creatine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl) or 300 mg 1 x daily (n = 509) were summarized for analysis. * p &lt; 0.001 versus Allopurinol, # p &lt; 0.001 versus 80 mg</seg>
<seg id="1216">Lowering the serum acid level to &lt; 6.0 mg / dl (357 µmol / l) was observed during the visit to the doctor in week 2 and maintained throughout the entire treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1217">509 patients received Allopurinol 300 mg 1 x daily; 10 patients with serum levels &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg of 1 x daily.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with renal inhibition of the APEX-study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with renal dysfunction (D).</seg>
<seg id="1219">With ADENURIC the primary efficacy endpoint was 44% (80 mg 1 x daily), 45% (120 mg 1 x daily) and 60% (240 mg 1 x daily) of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="1220">There were no clinically significant differences in the percentage return of serum acid concentrations in subjects regardless of kidney function (58% in the group with normal kidney function and 55% in the group with severe kidney function disorders).</seg>
<seg id="1221">Primary endpoint in the subgroup of patients with serum acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of Etwa 40% of patients (APEX- and FACT study) had a serum acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl.</seg>
<seg id="1222">Data from the open extension study of Phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum acid levels to &lt; 6 mg / dl (&lt; 357 µmol / l) resulted in a decrease in the incidence of gout attacks (i.e. more than 97% of patients needed no treatment against a gout).</seg>
<seg id="1223">This was associated with a reduction in the size of the gout, which resulted in 54% of the patients a complete disappearance of the lymph nodes until month 24.</seg>
<seg id="1224">Increased TSH values (&gt; 5.5 µIE / ml) were observed in patients who received long-term treatment with Febuxostat (5.0%) and also in patients who received Allopurinol (5.8%) in open long term extension studies (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1225">In healthy volunteers the maximum plasma concentrations (Cmax) and the surface under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) of Febuxostat increased after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose-proportionally.</seg>
<seg id="1226">For doses between 120 mg and 300 mg, an increase in the AUC is observed for Febuxostat which is larger than the dose proportional increase.</seg>
<seg id="1227">After taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily, the Cmax is approximately 2.8-3.2 µg / ml and 5.0-5.3 µg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1228">However, no clinically significant changes in serum acid concentration were observed if this was tested (multiple doses of 80 mg).</seg>
<seg id="1229">Distribution The apparent steady state distribution volume (Vss / F) of Febuxostat is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10-300 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1230">The plasma retention of Febuxostat amounts to about 99.2% (primary binding to albumin) and is constant over the concentration range, which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg.</seg>
<seg id="1231">In vitro studies with human liver microsomes, these oxidative metabolites are mainly formed by CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP2C8 or CYP2C9, and that Febuxostatglucuronid is mainly produced by UGT 1A1, 1A8 and 1A9.</seg>
<seg id="1232">After taking an 80 mg dose of 14C-marked Febuxostat, approximately 49% of the dose in the urine was found as immutable febuxostat (3%), known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (13%) and other unknown metabolites (3%).</seg>
<seg id="1233">In addition to excretion beyond the urine, approximately 45% of the dose in the stool was found as immutable febuxostat (12%), amcylglucuronid of the active substance (1%), its known oxidative metabolites and their conjugate (25%) and other unknown metabolites (7%).</seg>
<seg id="1234">Special patients' groups of renal insufficiency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild, moderate or severe renal insufficiency, the Cmax of Febuxostat did not change in relation to subjects with normal kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1235">The mean total AUC of Febuxostat increased by about 1.8-fold from 7.5 to 7.5μ, in the group with normal renal function to 13.2 μ megaloh / ml in the group with severe kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="1236">12 Liver Dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg ADENURIC in patients with mild (Child- pugh classification A) or moderate (Child-Pugh classification B) liver function restriction, the Cmax and AUC of Febuxostat and its metabolites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function.</seg>
<seg id="1237">Age There were no significant changes with regard to the AUC of febuxostat or its metabolites after intake of multiple oral doses of ADENURIC in older patients compared to younger subjects.</seg>
<seg id="1238">Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility In male rats, a statistically significant increase of urinary bladder tumours (transition cell papillomas and carcinomas) were found only in connection with Xanthin stones in the highly dosed group, at approximately 11 times the exposure to humans.</seg>
<seg id="1239">These findings are seen as a result of specific purinmetabolization and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="1240">In oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day, febuxostat has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats.</seg>
<seg id="1241">At high doses, which were approximately 4,3 times of human therapeutic exposure, maternal toxicity occurred which accompanied by a reduction in the breeding performance and a developmental delay in the offspring of rats.</seg>
<seg id="1242">Teratological studies in supporting rats with exposures, approximately 4,3-fold and in carrying rabbits with exposures, which amounted to about 13 times the human therapeutic exposure, yielded no teratogenic effects.</seg>

<seg id="1258">If you have a gout attack at the moment (sudden appearance of severe pain, pressure sensitivity, redness, warmth and joint swelling), wait until the plaster fall is clarified before starting treatment with ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1259">This does not have to be so, but may also occur with you, especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months, if you are taking ADENURIC.</seg>
<seg id="1260">Your doctor will prescribe other medicines if necessary to prevent a gout attack or treat related symptoms (such as pain and joint swelling).</seg>
<seg id="1261">Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use / use other medicines or have taken / used recently, even if it is not prescription medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1262">It is especially important that you inform your doctor or pharmacist if you use drugs containing one of the following substances as interactions with ADENURIC may occur and your doctor may want to consider necessary measures. • Mercaptopurin (for the treatment of asthma) • Theophylline (for the treatment of asthma) • Warfarin (for blood thinning in case of heart disease)</seg>
<seg id="1263">There were no studies on the effects of ADENURIC on the transport ability and the ability to operate machinery.</seg>

<seg id="1276">The patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water (no mineral water) at least 30 minutes before eating, drinking or taking other medicines (including antacids, calcium and vitamin supplements).</seg>
<seg id="1277">In order to avoid irritation of the oesophagus, the patient must not lie down until after the first dietary intake of the day, at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1278">As Alendronate and vitamin D3 are already used separately in drugs approved in the European Union, the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature.</seg>
<seg id="1279">The company also conducted a study of 35 men and 682 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to demonstrate the efficacy of ADROVANCE regarding the increase in vitamin D levels.</seg>
<seg id="1280">After a 15-week treatment, the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels in the patients treated with ADROVANCE was lower (11%) than those treated with Alendronate alone (32%).</seg>
<seg id="1281">The company also presented data that indicates that the Alendronate dosage contained in ADROVANCE matches exactly the dose needed to prevent bone loss.</seg>
<seg id="1282">The most common side effects (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are headaches, pains of the musculoskeletal system (muscles, bones or joints) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain, dyspepsia (diarrhoea), constipation (ulcera) of the oesophagus, dysphagia (swallowing disorders), battered abdomen (bloated stomach) as well as sour upset.</seg>
<seg id="1283">In patients with any hypersensitivity (allergy) against alendronate, vitamin D3 or any of the other components ADROVANCE may not be applied.</seg>

<seg id="1288">The following indications are to be observed precisely in order to reduce the risk of esophageal irritation and related side effects (see section 4.4):</seg>
<seg id="1289">• ADROVANCE should be swallowed only with a full glass of water (at least 200 ml) after the day. • Patients should not chew the tablet or melt the tablet in the mouth as there is a risk for oropharyngeal ulceroses. • Patients should not lie before the first dietary intake of the day, which should take place at least 30 minutes after taking the tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1290">B. peptic ulcers, active gastrointestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastrointestinal tract, apart from pyloroplasty, are given only under special care (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1291">Esophageal reactions such as ophagitis, oesophageal ulcera and esophageal erosions, rarely followed by esophageal strikholes, were reported in patients taking Alendronate (some of them were severe and required hospitalization).</seg>
<seg id="1292">The doctor should therefore be aware of any signs and symptoms that indicate potential esophageal reactions, and patients should be pointed out, in the presence of symptoms of esophageal irritation such as dysphagia, pain when swallowing or retrogressional pain or new or worsening heartburn the medicine and seek medical advice (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1293">3 The risk of severe butophageal side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or continue to take it after the onset of symptoms that point to esophageal irritation.</seg>
<seg id="1294">It is very important that all dosage instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1295">While in large-scale clinical studies with Alendronate no increased risk has been identified, stomach and duodenal ulcers, some of which are severe and with complications, were reported (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1296">Osteoneclipsis of the jaw, usually related to tooth extraction and / or local infection (including osteomyelitis), was reported in cancer patients whose treatment regimen mainly contain intravenous bisphosphonate.</seg>
<seg id="1297">There are no data available to indicate whether the setting of bisphosphonate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure reduces the risk of osteoarthritis of the jaw.</seg>
<seg id="1298">The clinical evaluation by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit-risk assessment.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Patients should be instructed to take the tablet next morning when taking a dose of ADROVANCE after having noticed their failure.</seg>
<seg id="1300">You should not take two tablets the same day, but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled day of the week.</seg>
<seg id="1301">Other diseases affecting mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency and hypoparathyreoidism) should also be adequately treated before starting treatment with ADROVANCE.</seg>
<seg id="1302">Alendronate foods and beverages (including mineral water), calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicines can affect the resorption of alendronate when taken at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="1303">Patients must therefore wait at least 30 minutes after taking Alendronate before taking other medicines (see sections 4.2 and 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1304">Although specific interaction studies were not carried out, Alendronate was taken in clinical trials with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs, without clinically relevant interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1305">ADROVANCE is intended only for postmenopausal women and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy nor by nursing women.</seg>
<seg id="1306">Animal studies with Alendronate leave no indication of directly damaging effects in regard to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal or postnatal development.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Osteoneclipsis of the jaw was reported in patients with bisphosphonates; most reports are from cancer patients but also reported in osteoporosis patients.</seg>

<seg id="1411">Due to clinically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tacrolimus, this can lead to transplant rejection or increased incidence of side effects including under- or overimmunosuppression.</seg>
<seg id="1412">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a medical device experienced in the transplantation (see Sections 4.4 and 4.8).</seg>

<seg id="1417">Careful and repeated controls of the Tacrolimus tallow are recommended during the first two weeks after transplantation under advagraf in order to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate post-transplant phase.</seg>

<seg id="1422">Further can adjustments may later be necessary, as the pharmacokinetic of tacrolimus can change in the course of the stabilization of the patient after the transplant.</seg>

<seg id="1424">Dosage recommendation - switch from Prograf to Advagraf Do a transplant recipient of two daily dosage of Prograf capsules to be converted to a once daily dose of advagraph, this change in ratio of 1: 1 (mg: mg), related to the entire daily dose, has to take place.</seg>
<seg id="1425">Kidney and liver transplants After a change from other immunosuppressants to advagraph once a day, the oral initial dose for the prophylaxis of graft rejection must commence with the recommended oral initial dose in renal and liver transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1426">An oral initial dose of 0.15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in adult patients who are referred to as Advagraf.</seg>
<seg id="1427">Other transplant recipients, although there is no clinical experience with advagraph in lung, pancreatic and colorectal transplants, was used in an oral initial dose of 0.10 - 0.15 mg / kg / day in case of transplanted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and at an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1428">Dosage changes in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function In order to maintain blood levels in the targeted area, a reduction of the dose can be required in patients with severe liver dysfunction.</seg>
<seg id="1429">Patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function has no influence on the pharmacokinetic of Tacrolimus, it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not required.</seg>
<seg id="1430">However, due to the nephrotoxic potential of tacrolimus, a careful monitoring of the renal function (including a regular determination of serum creatine, a calculation of the creatininfiltrates and a monitoring of the urine volume) is recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1431">Switching from Ciclosporin to Advagraf When switching from a Ciclosporin to a Tacrolimus-based therapy, caution is required (see sections 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1432">Recommendations on the level of the bottom blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and tolerability in individual cases with the aid of full blood tacrolimus-tallow-mirror controls.</seg>
<seg id="1433">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of tacrolimus-tallow during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1434">Blood tallow levels of tacrolimus should also be checked after switching from Prograf to advagraph, dosage adjustment, changes in immunosuppressive therapy or at the simultaneous use of substances that might change the Tacrolimus whole blood concentration (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1435">Since advagraf is a medicine with a low clearance, adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Steady State has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="1436">Clinical studies indicate that successful treatment in most cases is possible if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1437">In clinical practice, the tallow level of tacrolimus in full blood in the first time after liver transplantations is usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and with adrenal and heartfelt patients at 10 - 20 ng / ml.</seg>
<seg id="1438">During the subsequent maintenance treatment of liver, kidney and heart transplants, blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were usually used.</seg>
<seg id="1439">This has led to serious adverse events including graft rejection or other side effects that can occur as a result of tacrolimus under- or overexposure.</seg>
<seg id="1440">Patients should always maintain the same Tacrolimus formulation and the corresponding daily dosage; renditions of the formulation or the regime should only be performed under close-meshed control of a medical device experienced in the transplantation (see sections 4.2 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1441">5 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation is available.</seg>
<seg id="1442">No clinical data for the retarded formulation is available for the prevention of graft rejection in adult heart transplants and transplants in childhood.</seg>
<seg id="1443">Because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction in the tacrolimus levels in the blood and a weakening of the clinical effect of tacrolimus, the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) or other plant remedies during a treatment with advagraph is to be avoided (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1444">In patients with diarrhoea, a particularly careful monitoring of the Tacrolimus concentrations in the blood is offered because the Tacrolimus blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctuations in such circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="1445">In rare cases the anterior chamber or septum hypertrophie described as cardiomyopathy was observed, which can therefore also occur under advagraph.</seg>
<seg id="1446">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>
<seg id="1447">As with other immunosuppressants, exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the potential risk of malignant skin lesions by suitable clothing or use of a sunscreen with a high protection factor.</seg>

<seg id="1450">The simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can affect the metabolism of tacrolimus and thus increase or lower the blood values of tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1451">Therefore, it is recommended to monitor the Tacrolimus blood levels while offering substances that can change the CYP3A metabolism and adjust the Tacrolimus surcharge accordingly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="1453">Pharmacokinetic studies showed that the increase in blood levels results mainly from the increased oral bioavailability of tacrolimus, caused by the inhibition of gastrointestinal metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1454">Prednisolone or methylprednisolone, as used in acute rejection reactions, can increase or decrease the concentration of tacrolimus in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The effect of tacrolimus on the metabolism of other medicines Tacrolimus is known as CYP3A4 inhibition; hence, the simultaneous application of tacrolimus with medicines that are metabolized by CYP3A4 can affect their metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Because tacrolimus can reduce the Clearance of steroid contraceptives and thus increase hormone level, it is particularly cautious when making decisions about contraceptive measures.</seg>
<seg id="1457">The results of animal experiments have shown that tacrolimus potentially reduces the clearance of pentobarbital and phenazone and can prolong their half-life.</seg>

<seg id="1467">Benign or malignant neoplasms including EBV-associated lymphoproliferative diseases and skin tumors in connection with the treatment with tacrolimus were reported.</seg>
<seg id="1468">Due to its high molecular weight, its low water solubility and the high binding of erythrocytes and plasma proteins, it can be assumed that tacrolimus is not dialysis.</seg>
<seg id="1469">At the molecular level, the effects of tacrolimus are likely to be mediated by its binding to a cytosolean protein (FKBP12), which is responsible for the enrichment of the connection in the cellular memory.</seg>
<seg id="1470">This leads to a calcium-dependent inhibition of signal transduction pathways in the T cell, thereby preventing the transcription of a certain number of lymphocytes genes.</seg>

<seg id="1482">Overall, the safety profile of oral Prograf in these published studies was consistent with the major studies in which Prograf was used for primary immunosuppression with liver, kidney and heart transplants.</seg>
<seg id="1483">Lung transplantation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted, multicenter study with oral prograf, more than 110 patients were reported who received either Tacrolimus or Ciclosporin in 1: 1 randomisation.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Chronic graft rejection, bronchiolitis obliterans- syndrome, was observed less frequently in the first year after transplantation (2.86% versus 8.57%).</seg>
<seg id="1485">The survival rate after one year was 80.8% in the tacrolimus and 83% in the Ciclosporin group (Treede et al., 3rd ICI San Diego, USA, 2004; Abstract 22).</seg>
<seg id="1486">In the patients treated with Tacrolimus it came in 21.7% of cases to the emergence of bronchiolitis obliterans compared to 38.0% below Ciclosporin (p = 0.025).</seg>
<seg id="1487">The number of cases in which Ciclosporin had to be converted to Tacrolimus (n = 13) was significantly greater (p = 0.02) than the number of patients who were converted from Tacrolimus to Ciclosporin (n = 2) (Keenan et al., Ann Thoracic Surg 1995; 60: 580).</seg>
<seg id="1488">The number of cases in which no acute graft rejection happened was higher after 6 months (57.7% versus 45.8%) and after 1 year (50% versus 33.3%) in the treatment transplanted patients of the Tacrolimus group (Treede et al., J Heart Lung transplant 2001; 20: 511).</seg>
<seg id="1489">In a study, the frequency of the emergence of bronchiolitis was significantly lower in patients treated with tacrolimus.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Pancreatic transplantation A multicenter trial with oral prograf was performed in 205 patients who simultaneously underwent pancreatic and kidney transplantation, receiving a randomised trial of Tacrolimus (n = 103) or Ciclosporin (n = 102).</seg>
<seg id="1491">The oral initial dose (per protocol) of Tacrolimus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the desired valley level from 8 to 15 ng / ml to 5.</seg>
<seg id="1492">Colorectal transplantation The published clinical results of a monocentric study with oral prograf as primary immunosuppressant after colorectal transplantations showed a current survival rate of 75% after 1 year, 5% after 5 years and 42% after 10 years.</seg>
<seg id="1493">Methods for early detection of Epstein-Barr (EBV) - and CMV infections, bone marrow augmentation, additional administration of interleukin-2 antagonist daclizumab, lower initial doses of 10 and 15 ng / ml and recently transplant radiation (Abu-Elmede et al., Ann Surg 2001; 234: 404).</seg>
<seg id="1494">Factors such as low haematocrit and low protein concentrations lead to an increase in the unbound fraction of Tacrolimus, or a strengthening of metabolism led through treatment with corticosteroids should be responsible for the higher Clearance rates observed after the transplant.</seg>
<seg id="1495">This suggests that tacrolimus is almost completely metabolized before excretion, whereby excretion is mainly done via the bile.</seg>
<seg id="1496">In stable patients, which were converted from Prograf (twice daily) to Advagraf (once a day) in relation to 1: 1 (mg: mg) in relation to the total daily dose, systemic exposure of Tacrolimus (AUC0-24) under Advagraph was approximately 10% lower than under Prograf.</seg>
<seg id="1497">It is recommended to perform frequent controls of tacrolimus-tallow during the first two weeks after transplantation, followed by periodic controls during maintenance therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1498">21 For the treatment of adult patients with graft rejection, which proved to be refractory to other immunosuppressants, no clinical data for the retarded formulation is available.</seg>
<seg id="1499">Other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease, a treatment with corticosteroids, high blood pressure, kidney or liver dysfunction, infections, fluid overload and edema.</seg>

<seg id="1530">Advise is used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (a congenital blood clotting caused by the lack of factor VIII).</seg>
<seg id="1531">The dosage and frequency of use depend on whether advocates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1532">Patients with haemophilia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency, which causes blood clotting problems such as bleeding in the joints, muscles or internal organs.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Octocog alfa is not extracted from human plasma, but produced by a method called "recombinant DNA technology."</seg>
<seg id="1534">It is produced by a cell in which a gene (DNA) was introduced, enabling it to form the human coagulation factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1535">It is similar to another in the European Union called Recombinate, but is produced differently, so that the medicine does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin.</seg>
<seg id="1536">In three additional studies of patients with severe to moderate haemophilia A, including a study with 53 children under six years, the use of the drug was studied for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="1537">In the main study, the efficacy of lawyers in the prevention of bleeding was assessed in 86% of 510 new blood septic episodes with "excellent" respectively "good."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The most common side effects of lawyers (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are dizziness, headaches, pyrexia (fever) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1539">It may not be applied to patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to the human clotting factor VIII, mouse or hamster protein or any of the other ingredients.</seg>
<seg id="1540">In March 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Baxter AG for the marketing of lawyers throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1541">Dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of factor VIII deficiency, the location and extent of the bleeding and clinical condition of the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1542">In the case of the following hemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the indicated plasma levels (in% of the norm or in I.E. / dl).</seg>
<seg id="1543">Injection every 12-24 hours (8-24 hours in patients under 6 years) for 3-4 days or longer until pain and acute depression are removed.</seg>
<seg id="1544">Repeat injection every 8-24 hours (6-12 hours in patients under 6 years) until the risk is over for the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1545">During the course of the treatment, appropriate determination of the factor VIII plasma crucible is recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the injections.</seg>
<seg id="1546">Individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII, reach different in vivo recovery and show different half-value times.</seg>
<seg id="1547">3 Prevention of long-term prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with severe hemophilia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.U. of factor VIII per kg of body weight at intervals of 2-3 days.</seg>
<seg id="1548">If the expected Factor VIII plasma activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled by a suitable dose, a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibitor if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="1549">In patients with high inhibitors it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective, so that other therapeutic measures must be considered.</seg>
<seg id="1550">The administration rate should vary according to the patient's application, but a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded.</seg>
<seg id="1551">The formation of neutralizing antibodies against factor VIII is a known complication in the treatment of patients with haemophilia A.</seg>
<seg id="1552">These inhibitors are always against the procoagulatory activity of factor VIII targeted IgG immunoglobulins, which are quantified in Bethesda units (B.E.) per ml plasma by modified Bethesda assay.</seg>
<seg id="1553">The risk of developing inhibitors correlates with the extent of exposure to factor VIII, whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is greatest and depends on genetic and other factors.</seg>
<seg id="1554">In pretreated patients (PTPs) with more than 100 exposure days and amnestic known inhibitors, after switching from a recombinant factor VIII product to another, the reoccurrence of (low-trigen) inhibitors was observed.</seg>
<seg id="1555">Due to the rare occurrence of hemophilia A in women there are no experiences regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lactation.</seg>
<seg id="1556">ADRs, which occurred in the largest number of patients, were inhibitors of factor VIII (5 patients), all with previously untreated patients who have a higher risk of inhibiting the formation of inhibitors, headache (5 patients), fever and dizziness (3 patients each).</seg>
<seg id="1557">Very common (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 100), very rarely &lt; 1 / 10,000), not known (frequency based on available data cannot be estimated).</seg>
<seg id="1558">A) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of individual patients (234). the unexpected drop in the blood clotting factor VIII-Spike occurred postoperatively (10th - 14th postoperatively) in a patient under continuous ADVATE infusion.</seg>
<seg id="1559">During the whole time, blood clotting was maintained, and both the factor VIII- Mirror of the plasma and the clearing rate showed sufficient values again on the 15th day of the day.</seg>
<seg id="1560">In clinical studies with ADVATE on 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) and previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 150 days) only one patient showed a low inhibitor (2.4 B.E. in modified Bethesda approach) after 26 exposure days.</seg>
<seg id="1561">In addition, in none of the 53 paediatric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed serious until moderate haemophilia A (FVIII ≤ 2%) a FVIII inhibitor was detected after previous exposure to factor VIII- concentrates (≥ 50 days).</seg>
<seg id="1562">In previously untreated patients of a ongoing clinical study, 5 of 25 (20%) treated with ADVATE treated patients with inhibitors of factor VIII.</seg>
<seg id="1563">The patient's immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody titers against these proteins, laboratory parameters and reported side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1564">One patient showed both a statistically significant uptrend and a persistent peak of antibody level against anti-CHO cell protein, otherwise there were no signs or symptoms that indicated an allergic reaction or hypersensitivity.</seg>

<seg id="1638">Based on the data available since the initial approval, the CHMP has continued to evaluate the benefit-risk weighing as a positive, but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1639">Therefore, the CHMP has decided on the basis of ADVATE's safety profile, which necessitates submission of PSURs every 6 months, so that the authorisation holder is to apply for another renewal procedure in 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1640">In December 2008 Gendux Molecular Limited officially announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company has withdrawn its application for the marketing of Advexin for the treatment of Li-Fraumeni cancer.</seg>
<seg id="1641">Usually, however, the breast, the brain, the bones or the soft parts (fabric that connects, surrounds and supports other structures in the body) are affected.</seg>
<seg id="1642">This is a type of virus that has been genetically modified in such a way that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body.</seg>
<seg id="1643">The virus in Advexin is a "Adenovirus," which has been modified in such a way that it does not produce copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">Advance could have been injected directly into the tumors and thus enable the cancer cells to form the normal p53 protein.</seg>
<seg id="1645">The p53 protein, which is produced from the non-defective p53 gene, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered.</seg>
<seg id="1646">In case of Li-Fraumeni-Cancer, in which the p53 gene is defective, the p53 protein does not work properly, and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide.</seg>
<seg id="1647">The company presented data from a study with a patient in which Li-Fraumeni-Krebs appeared in the area of the underbelly, in the bones and in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="1648">After the CHMP checked the answers of the company to the questions asked to him, some questions were still unclear.</seg>
<seg id="1649">Based on the review of the initially submitted documentation, the CHMP generates 120 a list of questions sent to the company.</seg>
<seg id="1650">According to the CHMP, it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of advexin in Li-Fraumeni tumors benefits patients.</seg>
<seg id="1651">The Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body, the type of administration and the safety of the drug.</seg>
<seg id="1652">In addition, the company did not sufficiently demonstrate that Advexin can be established in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient.</seg>
<seg id="1653">The company did not notify the CHMP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or "Compassionate-Use" programs with Advexin.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"" "" "" "altered active substance release" "" "means that the tablets are composed in such a way that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours." ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Aerinaze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever, inflammation of the nasal passages caused by allergy to pollen) in patients with nasal mucosa swelling (clogged nose).</seg>
<seg id="1656">For adults and adolescents from 12 years onwards, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food.</seg>
<seg id="1657">The duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clarified.</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug may be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy deviations were the changes in the severity of the hay fever symptoms reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">In consideration of all hay fever symptoms except the constipation of the nose, the patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0%, compared to 35.9% in the patients who received pseudoephedrine alone.</seg>
<seg id="1662">If only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under Aerinaze showed a decrease in symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients who received desloratadin alone.</seg>
<seg id="1663">The most common side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dry mouth, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (restlessness), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (insomnia), somnolence (sleepiness), sleep disorders and nervousness.</seg>
<seg id="1664">Aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other components that are active against adrenergic agents or loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies).</seg>
<seg id="1665">Aerinaze may not be applied to patients suffering from narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), ischuria (hypertension), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrophy), hyperthyroidism (hyperthyrophy) or a haemorrhagic stroke (cerebral haemorrhage) or have a risk of hemorrhagic stroke.</seg>
<seg id="1666">On 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe to transport Aerinaze to the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1667">The tablet can be taken with a glass of water but is to be swallowed whole (i.e. without tearing, breaking or chewing).</seg>
<seg id="1668">Due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.1), aerinaze should not be used in children under 12 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms end.</seg>
<seg id="1670">It is recommended to limit the duration of use to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine in time.</seg>
<seg id="1671">After the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can be continued with desloratadin as monotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="1672">As Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within the 2 weeks following completion of such a therapy.</seg>
<seg id="1673">This is due to the alphamimetic activity combined with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocriptin, pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, ergotamine, diergotamine, ephedrine, oxymetazoline, naphazolin, etc.).</seg>
<seg id="1674">The safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient and the data did not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1675">The safety and efficacy of aerinaze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data did not suffice to pronounce appropriate dosage recommendations.</seg>
<seg id="1676">Patients need to be informed that the treatment of hypertension or tachycardia or palpitations, arrhythmia, nausea or any other neurological symptoms (such as headaches or a strengthening of headaches) must be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="1677">In the treatment of the following patient groups, caution is advised: • Patients with cardiac arrhythmias • Patients with hypertension • Patients with a myocardial infarction in the anamnesis, diabetes mellitus, bladder neck, or bronchospasm in the anamnesis.</seg>
<seg id="1678">Aerinaze is to be deprecated at least 48 hours before performing dermatological tests, as antihistamines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions.</seg>
<seg id="1679">In clinical trials with desloratadin, where erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally given, no clinically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentration of desloratadin were observed.</seg>
<seg id="1680">The results of the psychomotor test showed no significant differences between those treated with placebo and placebo-treated patients regardless of whether or not the loratadin was taken alone or with alcohol.</seg>
<seg id="1681">The enzyme responsible for the metabolism of desloratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out.</seg>
<seg id="1682">In-vivo CYP2D6 does not inhibit Desloratadin, and in-vitro studies have shown that CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>
<seg id="1683">The safety of the application of aerinaze during pregnancy is not assured, however, experience gained from a large number of affected pregnancy did not increase the frequency of abnormalities compared to the frequency of the normal population.</seg>
<seg id="1684">Since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vasoconstrictive properties of pseudoephedrine, aerinaze should not be applied during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="1685">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a dizziness which can lead to impairment of the transport ability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1686">Symptoms may vary between CNS depression (sedation, apnea, decreased mental alertness, cyanosis, coma, cardiovascular collapse) and CNS stimulation (insomnia, hallucinations, tremors, convulsions) with possible sequential processes.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Headache, anxiety, difficult miction, muscular weakness and increased muscle tension, euphoria, excitement, breathing insufficiency, heart rhythm disorders, tachycardia, palpitations, thirst, transpiration, nausea, vomiting, precessional pain, dizziness, tinnitus, ataxia, vision disturbances and hypertension or hypotonia.</seg>
<seg id="1688">CNS stimulation is particularly likely in children, as well as atropine-typical symptoms (dry mouth, pupillary starre and - dilatation, skin comfort, hyperthermia and gastrointestinal symptoms).</seg>
<seg id="1689">These include both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the P-Selectin adhesion molecule on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1690">During a single dose study with adults, Desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1691">In controlled clinical studies no increased frequency of sleepiness was observed in the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1692">The oral application of pseudoephedrine in the recommended dosage can cause further symptomatic effects, such as an increase in blood pressure, a tachycardia or manifestations of a CNS arousal.</seg>
<seg id="1693">1,248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years took part in seasonal allergic rhinitis, with 414 patients receiving Aerinaze tablets.</seg>
<seg id="1694">In both studies, the histamine antagonistic efficacy of aerinaze tablets was significantly higher compared to the total score for symptoms (excluding mucous membrane swelling), significantly higher than under a monotherapy with pseudoephedrine for the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1695">The effectiveness of aerobic tablets with regard to the swelling effect, determined by the nasal mucosa swelling, was significantly higher than under a monotherapy with desloratadin over the 2-week treatment period.</seg>
<seg id="1696">The efficacy of aerobic tablets showed no significant difference in terms of gender, age or ethnicity.</seg>
<seg id="1697">As part of a single dose study on pharmacokinetics of aerinaze, desloratadin is detectable within 30 minutes of administration in plasma.</seg>
<seg id="1698">After the oral application of aerinaze in healthy volunteers over 14 days, the body weight of desloratadin, 3-hydroxydesloratadin and pseudoephedrine was reached on Day 10.</seg>
<seg id="1699">In the context of a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects, it was found that four subjects were poor in lost loratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1700">A component interaction study shows that the exposure (Cmax and AUC) of pseudoephedrine after the sole administration of pseudoephedrine bio-equivalent was to exposure to an aerinaze tablet.</seg>
<seg id="1701">Based on conventional studies on safety disease, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, the preclinical data with lost radin can not identify any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="1702">The combination did not possess a greater toxicity than its constituents, and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseudoephedrine.</seg>
<seg id="1703">In reproductive toxicological studies the combination of Loratadin / pseudoephedrine was not teratogenic in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and in rabbits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="1704">In March 2007 and in Module 1.8.1 of the application application, the pharmaceutical vigilance system described is established and works before and while the product is on the market.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Antihistamines contribute to the alleviation of the allergic symptoms by preventing histamine, a body's substance, its effect.</seg>

<seg id="1717">Following the market launch of desloratadin, very rare cases of severe allergic reactions (shortness of breath, whistling breathing, itching, hives and swelling) or skin rash have been reported.</seg>
<seg id="1718">In cases of palpitations, heartthroats, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, stomach upset, diarrhea, hallucinations, dizziness, nausea, insomnia, muscle pain, seizures, restlessness with increased physical activity, over cases of liver inflammation and over cases of conspicuous liver values was also reported very rarely.</seg>
<seg id="1719">It is available as 5 mg tablet, 5 mg lyophilisate for taking (soluble tablet), 2.5 mg and 5 mg. melting tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), 0.5 mg / ml syrup and as 0.5 mg / ml solution.</seg>
<seg id="1720">For children aged one to five years, the dose is 1.25 mg once daily, which is in the form of 2.5 ml syrup or syrup.</seg>
<seg id="1721">For children between six and eleven years, the dose is 2.5 mg once daily, either in the form of 5 ml syrup or either.</seg>
<seg id="1722">Aerius was examined in a total of eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhinitis (including four studies of seasonal allergic rhinitis and two studies on patients who had also asthma).</seg>
<seg id="1723">The effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms (itching, number and size of the quadruple, impairment of sleep and performance on the day) before and after six weeks of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1724">Further studies have been submitted to prove that the body utilizes the syrup, the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless.</seg>
<seg id="1725">In case of allergic rhinitis, if the results of all studies were taken together, the two-week treatment with 5 mg of aperius led to an average decrease in symptom scores (symptoms of symptoms) by 25 to 32%, compared to the decrease of 12 to 26% in the patients receiving a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1726">In the two studies in Urticaria, the decrease of symptom scores after six weeks of treatment with Aerius 58 and 67%, compared to 40 and 33% in the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1727">Aerius may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to loratadine, laurel or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1728">In January 2001, the European Commission issued approval to the company SP Europe for the marketing of Aerius in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1729">One tablet once a day, with one or without a meal, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1730">There is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of desloratadin in adolescents from 12 to 17 years (see sections 4.8 and 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1731">The treatment of the intermittent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks) should be carried out according to the previous course of disease and can be stopped after the symptoms decay and resumed after reoccurring.</seg>
<seg id="1732">In the persistent allergic rhinitis (occurrence of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks), a continuing treatment can be recommended to the patient during the allergy.</seg>
<seg id="1733">Clinically relevant interactions were not found in clinical studies with desloratadin tablets in which erythromycin or ketoconazole were additionally administered (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1734">In a clinically pharmacological study, the performance-reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking Aerius and alcohol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1735">Patients should, however, be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to dizziness, which can lead to impairment of the transport ability or the ability to operate machinery.</seg>
<seg id="1736">In clinical trials in various indications including allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, 3% more adverse events were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily in patients with Aerius than in patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1737">The most common adverse events reported on placebo were fatigue (1.2%), dry mouth (0.8%) and headache (0.6%).</seg>
<seg id="1738">In a clinical study with 578 young patients aged 12 to 17, the most common side effect was headaches, this occurred in 5.9% of patients treated with desloratadin and in 6.9% of the patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1739">No clinically relevant effects were observed in a multi-dose study, which was administered up to 45 mg of desloratadin (nine-fold clinical dose).</seg>
<seg id="1740">This includes both inhibiting the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-4, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-13 from human mast cells / basophiles as well as the inhibition of the expression of the optic molecule P-Selectin on endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="1741">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>
<seg id="1742">In a clinically-pharmacological study, in which desloratadin was administered in a dose of 45 mg daily (the nine-times the clinical dose) was administered over ten days, there was no prolongation of the Qtc interval.</seg>
<seg id="1743">In a single dose study with adults, desloratadin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement variables of the flight performance including reinforcement of subjective sleepiness or tasks associated with flying.</seg>
<seg id="1744">In patients with allergic rhinitis, Aerius was effective in alleviating symptoms such as sneezing, nasal secretion and itching of the nose, itching, tearing and redness of the eyes as well as itching on the palate.</seg>
<seg id="1745">In addition to the established classification in seasonal and perennial, allergic rhinitis can alternatively be divided into intermittent allergic rhinitis and persisting allergic rhinitis depending on the duration of the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1746">Intermittent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1747">Persistent allergic rhinitis is defined as the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="1748">As demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire on quality of life at Rhino-conjunctivitis, Aerius effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rhinitis.</seg>
<seg id="1749">The chronically idiopathic urticaria was investigated as a substitute for further forms of urticaria, as the underlying pathophysiology regardless of etiology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be randomly recruited.</seg>
<seg id="1750">Since histamine release is a causative factor in all urinary diseases, it is expected that in other forms of urticaria, desloratadin also leads to an improvement in symptoms; this is confirmed by the recommendations of the clinical guidelines.</seg>
<seg id="1751">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing size and number of quadrudes at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1752">As in other studies with antihistamines in chronic idiopathic urticaria, the minority of patients who did not respond to antihistamines was excluded from the study.</seg>
<seg id="1753">Improved itching by more than 50% was observed in 55% of patients treated with desloratadin compared to 19% of patients treated with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="1754">Treatment with Aerius significantly reduced the disturbance of sleep and waking, as measured by a 4-point scale for evaluating these variables.</seg>
<seg id="1755">In a pharmacokinetic study comparing patient demos with the general seasonal allergic rhinitis population, 4% of patients achieved higher concentration of desloratadin.</seg>
<seg id="1756">There are no indications of clinically relevant cumulation after once daily use of desloratadin (5- 20 mg) over 14 days.</seg>
<seg id="1757">However, the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of loratadin has not yet been identified, so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded.</seg>
<seg id="1758">Neither CYP3E and in-vitro studies have shown that the drug CYP2D6 does not inhibit CYP2D6 and is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the P-glycoproteins.</seg>

<seg id="1763">Aerius can be taken irrespective of meals, to alleviate the symptoms of allergic rhinitis (including intermittent and persistent allergic rhinitis) and urticaria (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1764">The prescribing physician should be aware that most cases of rhinitis in children under 2 years are caused by an infection (see section 4.4) and that there are no data available that support a treatment of infectious rhinitis with Aerius.</seg>
<seg id="1765">In addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatomical anomalies, anamnesis, physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin analyses should play a role.</seg>
<seg id="1766">About 6% of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabolise desloratadin and experience higher substance strain (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1767">The safety of Aerius syrup for children between 2 and 11 years, which metabolize fully metabolized, is identical to that of children who metabolize normally.</seg>

<seg id="1775">Because the course of allergic rhinitis / chronic idiopathic urticaria and the profile of desloratadin in adults and children are similar, the efficacy data of desloratadin in adults can be extrapolated to the children's population.</seg>
<seg id="1776">As part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents, in which desloratadin was applied in a dose of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days, no statistically significant or clinically relevant cardiovascular effect was described.</seg>

<seg id="1783">In two placebo-controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in improving pruritus and reducing size and number of quadrudes at the end of the first dose interval.</seg>
<seg id="1784">The spread of this limited metabolisation phenotype was similar in adults (6%) and children between 2 and 11 years (6%) and in both populations larger in blacks (18% adults, 16% children) than with Caucaasians (2% adults, 3% children).</seg>
<seg id="1785">Similar pharmacokinetic parameters were observed in a pharmacokinetic multi-dose study with syrup formulation of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhinitis, which metabolize fully metabolized.</seg>

<seg id="1893">June 2008, Novartis Vaccines and Diagnostics S.r.l. officially announced the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) that the company withdraws its application for the marketing of Aflunov for the prevention of aviary H5N1 influenza in adults and older people.</seg>
<seg id="1894">Aflunov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza caused by the strain (type) H5N1 of the influenza A virus.</seg>
<seg id="1895">This is a special kind of vaccine that should protect from a strain of the flu virus that could cause a future pandemic.</seg>
<seg id="1896">A flu pandemic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears, which can easily spread from man to person, because humans have no immunity (no protection) against it.</seg>
<seg id="1897">Once the vaccine is administered, the immune system recognises the constituent parts of the flu virus as "foreign" and forms antibodies against it.</seg>
<seg id="1898">This makes the immune system later able to produce antibodies more quickly in contact with a flu virus of this trunk.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Subsequently, the membrane shell of the virus was cleaned, cleaned and used as a component of the vaccine with the "surface antigens" (proteins on the membrane surface that recognizes the human body as a foreign body).</seg>
<seg id="1900">An inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out according to the "good clinical practice" (GCP).</seg>
<seg id="1901">As a result, the scope of the clinical data base was insufficient to evaluate the safety of the vaccine to meet the requirements of the EMEA guidelines for pre-pandemic vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="1902">If you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment, please contact your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="1903">If you would like further information on the CHMP recommendations, please read the scientific discussion (also part of the EPAR).</seg>
<seg id="1904">It is used in combination with other antiviral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV-1), which causes the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).</seg>
<seg id="1905">For patients unable to swallow the capsules, Agenerase is available as a solution, but this cannot be taken together with Ritonavir, as the safety of this combination has not been studied.</seg>
<seg id="1906">Agenerase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked out which antiviral drug has been taken by the patient before, and the probability has judged that the virus is addressed to the medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1907">The recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily, which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Ritonavir and with other antiviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1908">In children between the age of four and twelve, and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg, the recommended dose of Agenerase depends on body weight.</seg>
<seg id="1909">In combination with other antiviral medicines, Agenerase reduces the HIV level in the blood and keeps it at a low level.</seg>
<seg id="1910">Not cure AIDS, however, can delay damage to the immune system and therefore also the development of infections and diseases connected to AIDS.</seg>
<seg id="1911">Agenerase was investigated in combination with other antiviral medicines, but without Ritonavir, in two main studies with 736 HIV-infected adults who had not previously been treated with protease inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="1912">It was compared with other protease inhibitors in 206 adults who used early protease inhibitors in 206 adults.</seg>
<seg id="1913">The main indicator of effectiveness was the proportion of patients with no detectable levels of HIV in the blood (viral load) or the change in the viral load after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1914">In trials with patients who had previously not taken protease inhibitors, more patients had a viral load of less than 400 copies / ml under placebo for 48 weeks, but Agenerase was less effective than indinavir.</seg>
<seg id="1915">In children, Agenerase also reduced the viral load, but the children who had previously been treated with protease inhibitors only very few responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1916">In the study of adults who previously had been treated with protease inhibitors, the drug Agenerase enhanced the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment as effectively as other protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1917">In the patients with HIV that was resistant to four other protease inhibitors, Agenerase combined with Ritonavir increased the viral load after four weeks compared to the patients who continued their former protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="1918">The most common side effects of Agenerase (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are headache, diarrhoea (diarrhea), flatulence (nausea), nausea, vomiting, rash and fatigue.</seg>
<seg id="1919">2 / 3 Agenerase cannot be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to amprenavir or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="1920">Agenerase should not be used in patients, the St. John's Wort (a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression) or drugs that are degraded just like Agenerase and are detrimental in high concentrations in the blood.</seg>
<seg id="1921">As with other medicines for HIV, there is a risk of lipodystrophy (changes in the distribution of body fat), osteonectin (the death of bone tissue) or an immune activation syndrome (symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system).</seg>
<seg id="1922">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of atherase in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults and children were predominant over four years compared to the risks.</seg>
<seg id="1923">Agenerase is usually taken together with the pharmacokinetic amplifier Ritonavir, but the committee noted that the benefit of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir in patients who had previously taken no protease inhibitors has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"" "Agenerase was originally licensed under" "" "extraordinary circumstances" "" "since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons." ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">In October 2000, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for the marketing of Agenerase in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="1926">Agenerase is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicines for the treatment of HIV-1 infected, protease inhibitors (PI) -pre-treated adults and children from 4 years onwards.</seg>
<seg id="1927">Usually Agenerase capsules are to be administered to pharmacokinetic boosters of amprenavir along with low doses of kritonavir (see sections 4.2 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1928">The use of amprenavir should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and pretreatment of the patient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1929">The bioavailability of amprenavir as a solution to take up is 14% less than of amprenavir as a capsule; therefore, Agenerase capsules and solution for taking on a milligram per milligram base are not exchangeable (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1930">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 600 mg of amprenavir twice daily along with 100 mg of Ritonavir twice daily in combination with other antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="1931">2 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of kritonavir (boosters), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1933">The pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of Agenerase in combination with low doses of kritonavir or other protease inhibitors were not studied in children.</seg>
<seg id="1934">Agenerase is not recommended for use in children under the age of 4 due to the lack of data on safety and efficacy (see section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="1935">Based on the pharmacokinetic data, the dose of Agenerase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver function disorder should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders to 300 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1936">Concurrent use should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction with care, in patients with severe liver dysfunction it is contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="1937">Agenerase cannot be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also present substrates of the cytochrome P450-isopropum 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1938">Herbal preparations containing St. John's Wort (Hypericum perforatum) may not be used due to the risk of reduced plasma concentrations and a reduced therapeutic effect of amprenavir while taking amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1939">Patients should be advised that Agenerase or any other antiretroviral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and may continue to develop opportunistic infections or other complications of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1940">The current antiretroviral therapy, including treatment with Agenerase, does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood.</seg>
<seg id="1941">Usually, Agenerase capsules should be used together with low doses of Ritonavir and in combination with other antiretroviral drugs (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="1942">Patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with antiretroviral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal consequences.</seg>
<seg id="1943">For the case of simultaneous antibiotic treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine.</seg>
<seg id="1944">Patients with pre-existing liver function, including chronic active hepatitis, show increased frequency of liver dysfunction under antiretroviral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice.</seg>
<seg id="1945">The simultaneous application of Agenerase and Ritonavir with fluticasone or other glucocorticoids that are metabolised via CYP3A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects including Cushing and Suppression of the adrenal function (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1946">Because the interchange of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors Lovastatin and Simvastatin is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, simultaneous administration of ageneric with Lovastatin and Simvastatin is not recommended because of the increased risk of myopathies including rhabdomyolysis.</seg>
<seg id="1947">4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life-threatening side effects such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, tricyclic antidepressants and warfarin (under monitoring of the International Regular Ratio), methods for determining the drug concentration are available.</seg>
<seg id="1948">In patients who take these drugs at the same time, Agenerase can be less effective because of reduced plasma levels of amprenavir (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="1949">Due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with amprenavir, the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives may be altered, however the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions.</seg>
<seg id="1950">If methadone is given at the same time with amprenavir, the patients should be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if also low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1951">Due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high susceptibility to propylene, this formulation is contraindicated in children under the age of four and should be used with caution in certain other patient groups.</seg>
<seg id="1952">Agenerase should be set in duration 5 if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mucous membranes are involved (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="1953">In patients who received antiretroviral therapy including protease inhibitors, diabetes mellitus, hyperglycemia or an exacerbation of an existing diabetes mellitus was reported.</seg>
<seg id="1954">Many of the patients had other diseases that were needed for their therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes mellitus or hyperglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="1955">B. higher age, and associated with drug-related factors, such as prolonged antiretroviral treatment and associated metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="1956">In hemophilic patients (type A and B) treated with protease inhibitors, reports on an increase of hemorrhages including spontaneous cutaneous hematomas and haemarthrosis occur.</seg>
<seg id="1957">In HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect, an anti-retroviral combination therapy (ART) can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsening of symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1958">Although multifactorial etiology is accepted (including application of corticosteroids, alcohol consumption, severe immunosuppression, higher body mass index), cases of osteoneclipse were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV infection and / or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="1959">CYP3A4 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase cannot be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the cytochrome P450-isopropum 3A4 (CYP3A4).</seg>
<seg id="1960">CYP2D6 substrates with low therapeutic width Agenerase with kritonavir may not be given together with medicines, whose active ingredients are metabolized mainly via CYP2D6 and are associated with serious and / or life-threatening side effects.</seg>
<seg id="1961">It has been shown that Rifampicin causes a 82% decrease in the AUC of amprenavir, which can lead to virological failure and resistance development.</seg>
<seg id="1962">In the attempt to balance the low plasma levels by a dose increase of other protease inhibitors in combination with Ritonavir, adverse effects on the liver were often observed.</seg>
<seg id="1963">St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) The serum levels of amprenavir can be decreased by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum).</seg>
<seg id="1964">If a patient already takes St. John's wort, the viral load levels and, if possible, check the viral load and remove the St. John's Wort.</seg>
<seg id="1965">Dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required when nelfinavir is administered together with amprenavir (see also Efavirenz below).</seg>
<seg id="1966">508% increases, whereas Cmax is reduced by 30% when Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with amprenavir capsules (600 mg twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1967">In clinical trials, dosages of 600 mg of amprenavir were applied twice daily and Ritonavir 100 mg twice daily which substantiate the efficacy and safety of this treatment diagram.</seg>
<seg id="1968">52% humbled when amprenavir (750 mg twice daily) was administered in combination with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily).</seg>
<seg id="1969">The Cmin values of amprenavir in plasma, which were achieved twice a day with the combination of amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) with Kaletra (400 mg Lopinavir + 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily) are given twice daily in combination with 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="1970">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and kaletra can not be given, but close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="1971">No pharmacokinetic study was carried out in combination with didanosine in combination with didanosine, but due to the fantasies of didanosine it is recommended that didanosine and ageneric income are at least one hour apart (see Antazida below).</seg>
<seg id="1972">Therefore, in the application of Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) no dose adjustment is required.</seg>
<seg id="1973">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of Nevirapin on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggests that Nevirapin may reduce the serum concentration of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1975">If these medicines should be used at the same time, caution is required as delavirus could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly subtherapeutic plasma crucible.</seg>
<seg id="1976">If these medicines are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirus is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of amprenavir and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentration (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to a rise in side effects associated with rifabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">If it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with Agenerase, a reduction in the dosage of rifabutin to at least half of the recommended dose is recommended, although no clinical data is available.</seg>
<seg id="1979">Pharmacokinetic studies with Agenerase in combination with erythromycin have not been performed, however the plasma levels of both medicines could be increased in the event of simultaneous administration.</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fosamprenavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase of the Cmax of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) once daily without the simultaneous application of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">Other medicines that are listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4, may lead to interactions, if applied together with ageneric.</seg>
<seg id="1982">Patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions which are associated with these medicines if used in combination with ageneric.</seg>
<seg id="1983">Based on the data of other protease inhibitors, it is advisable that Antazida should not be taken at the same time as ageneric as it can cause resorption defects.</seg>
<seg id="1984">The simultaneous application of anticonvulsiva known as enzyme products (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine), with amprenavir can lead to a degradation of the plasma levels of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1985">Serum concentrations of calcium channel blockers such as amlodipine, diltiazem, felodipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine, nifedipine.</seg>
<seg id="1986">Simultaneous consumption with Agenerase can significantly increase their plasma concentrations and increase with PDE5 inhibitors associated side-effects including hypotension, blurred vision and priapism (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1987">In a clinical study, in which Ritonavir was given 100 mg capsules twice a day along with 50 µg fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times daily) over 7 days in subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels rose significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%).</seg>
<seg id="1988">As a result, the simultaneous administration of Agenerase with Ritonavir along with these glucocorticoids is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1989">In the case of HMG CoA reductase inhibitors, such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time by administering Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="1990">Because plasma level increases of these HMG CoA reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhubdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs is not recommended with Amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="1991">More frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended as plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased while adding amprenavir (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1992">Therefore, Agenerase cannot be used together with orally taken Midazolam (see Section 4.3) while using Agenerase with parenteral midazolam.</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for simultaneous use of parenteral midazolam with other protease inhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Midazolam around 3 to 4 faders.</seg>
<seg id="1994">If methadone is administered together with amprenavir, the patients should be monitored on opium withdrawal symptoms, especially if also low doses of kritonavir are administered.</seg>
<seg id="1995">Due to the low reliability of historical comparisons, no recommendation can currently be given as to how the amprenavirus can be adjusted if amprenavir is administered at the same time with methadone.</seg>
<seg id="1996">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1997">The effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods for contraception are also recommended.</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of Agenerase (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="1999">This drug may only be used during pregnancy after careful balancing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fetus.</seg>
<seg id="2000">In the milk of lactation rats, amprenavir-related substances were detected, but it is not known whether amprenavir passes into breast milk in humans.</seg>
<seg id="2001">A reproduction study of pregnant rats, given by the implantation in the uterus to the end of the lactation period of Amprenavir, showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2002">Further development of the seed, including fertility and reproductive ability, was not affected by the administration of amprenavir to the dam.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Agenerase's harmlessness has been studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various antiretroviral medicines.</seg>
<seg id="2004">Most side effects associated with the Agenerase Treatment were mild to moderate, early up and rarely lead to treatment failure.</seg>
<seg id="2005">Many of these events have not been clarified whether they are associated with the intake of Agenerase or another medicine applied to the HIV treatment, or whether they are a result of the underlying disease.</seg>
<seg id="2006">Most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical studies (PROAB3001, PROAB3006), in which the patients with protease inhibitors have not received 1200 mg of Agenerase twice a day.</seg>
<seg id="2007">Events (Grade 2 to 4), which were evaluated by the investigators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1% of the patients, as well as subsequent laboratory changes (Grade 3 to 4) are performed.</seg>
<seg id="2008">Antiretroviral combination therapy was associated with redistribution of body fat (lipodystrophy) in HIV patients, including loss of peripheral and differential subcutaneous fatty tissue, increased intra-abdominal and visceral fat tissue, hypertrophy of the breasts and dorsal fat accumulation (stitching).</seg>
<seg id="2009">Under 113 antiretroviral not pre-treated persons treated with amprenavir in combination with lamivudine / Zidovudine over a mean duration of 36 weeks, only one case (stitching) (&lt; 1%) was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2010">In the study PROAB 3006, in 245 NRTI- pre-treated patients were found under Amprenavir 7 cases (3%) in 241 patients under indinavir, in combination with various NRTIs over a mean duration of 56 weeks (p &lt; 0.001).</seg>
<seg id="2011">Skin rashes were usually mild to moderate, erythematous or makuloy nature, with or without itching and occurred spontaneously during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without having to cancel the treatment with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2012">Osteonecrosis cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors, advanced HIV infection or long-term use of antiretroviral combination therapy (ART).</seg>
<seg id="2013">HIV-infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic infections at the time of initiation of an antiretroviral combination therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2014">With PI pretreated patients who received 600 mg of Agenerase twice a day along with low dosed kritonavir (100 mg twice daily), the type and frequency of adverse events (Grade 3 and 4) were comparable in patients who received Agenerase along with low-dose kritonavir very frequently.</seg>
<seg id="2015">In case of overdosage, the patient is aware of an indication of an intoxiation (see Section 4.8) if necessary, to initiate necessary supporting measures.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Amprenavir binds to the active centre of the HIV-1 protease and thereby prevents the process of viral Gag- and gag-pol- polyprotein precursors with the result of a formation of unripe, non-infectious viral particles.</seg>
<seg id="2017">The antiviral activity of Amprenavir in vitro versus HIV-1 IIIB was examined both in acute and chronically infected lymphoblastic cell lines (MT-4, CEM-CCRF, H9) and peripheral blood lymphocytes.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The 50% inhibitor concentration (IC50) of amprenavir is 0,012 to 0.08 µM in acute infected cells and is 0,41 µM in chronically infected cells</seg>
<seg id="2019">The relationship between the activity of amprenavir against HIV-1 in vitro and the inhibition of HIV-1 replication in humans is not yet defined.</seg>
<seg id="2020">In the treatment of antiretroviral not pretreated patients with the currently approved Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir dosages - as with other Ritonavir-based treatment schemes with protease inhibitors - the mutations described are rarely observed.</seg>
<seg id="2021">In sixteen of 434 antiretroviral not pre-treated patients who received 700mg Fosamprenavir with 100mg of Ritonavir twice a day in the ESS100732 study, a virological failure occurred up to week 48, whereby 14 isolates could be genotypically examined.</seg>
<seg id="2022">Genotypic analysis of the isolation of 13 out of 14 children in which a virological failure occurred within the 59 patients not previously treated with protease inhibitors showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults.</seg>
<seg id="2023">L10F / I / V, V11I, I13V, K20R, V32I, L33F, E34Q, G48V, I50V, I54L / M / T / V, Q58E, D60E, I62V, I85V, L90M and I93L / M.</seg>
<seg id="2024">In the APV30003 study and its extension APV30005 (700 mg Fosamprenavir / 100 mg Ritonavir twice daily: n = 107) with protease inhibitors, patients with virological failure occurred over 96 weeks, following protease inhibitors:</seg>
<seg id="2025">Based on genotypic resistance testing, phenotypic interpretation systems can be used to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2026">The current (July 2006) ANRS AC 11 algorithm for Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir defines resistance to the presence of mutations V32I + 147a / V, or I50V, or at least 4 of the following mutations L10F / I, I62V, V82A / C / F, I84V and L90M in conjunction with an increased phenotypic resistance to Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir and a reduced probability of virological response (resistance).</seg>
<seg id="2027">The conclusions about the relevance of certain mutations or mutation patterns may be subject to changes due to additional data, and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests.</seg>
<seg id="2028">Phenotypic interpretation systems based on phenotypic resistance testing can be used in conjunction with genotypic data to estimate the activity of Amprenavir / Ritonavir or Fosamprenavir / Ritonavir in patients with protease inhibitor-resistant isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2029">Companies that sell diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinically phenotypical cut-offs (separation points) for FPV / RTV, which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test.</seg>
<seg id="2030">Each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to amprenavir associated genetic patterns produces a certain cross resistance to Ritonavir, but the sensitivity to indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir remains generally preserved.</seg>
<seg id="2031">There are currently data on cross-resistance between amprenavir and other protease inhibitors for all 4 Fosamprenavir resistance paths, either alone or in combination with other mutations.</seg>
<seg id="2032">Based on twenty-five antiretroviral not pre-treated patients in which a Fosamprenavirus-containing scheme failed (one of them showed resistance to Lopinavir / Ritonavir (three out of 25 insulates), indinavir / ritonavir (three out of 24 isolates), saquinavir (three out of 24 isolates) and Tipranavir / Ritonavir (four out of 24 isolates).</seg>
<seg id="2033">On the contrary, Amprenavir maintains its activity against some other proteasms-resistant isolates; the preservation of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mutations in the isolates.</seg>
<seg id="2034">Early failure of a failure treatment is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mutations that can adversely affect subsequent treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2035">The proof of the efficacy of Agenerase in combination with Ritonavir 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO30017, a randomized open study, in which with PI pretreated adults tested with Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) and Nukleosidaloga (NRTI) or a standard therapy (standard of care, SOC) with a PI, predominantly with lowest dosed kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2036">One hundred and sixty-three (n = 163) patients with proven virus sensitivity to Agenerase, at least one PI and at least one NRTI were included in the partial study A of PRO30017.</seg>
<seg id="2037">The primary analysis showed the non-inferiority of APV / Ritonavir compared to the SOC-PI group in the viral load (AAUCMB) in the viral load (HIV-1 RNA) in the plasma after 16 weeks, with a non-difference threshold of 0.4 log10 copies / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2038">Evidence of the efficacy of unbiased Agenerase is based on two uncontrolled trials involving 288 HIV-infected children aged 2 to 18, of which 152 were pre-treated with PI.</seg>
<seg id="2039">In the studies Agenerase was tested for intake and capsules of 15 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg three times daily, 20 mg / kg twice daily and 22.5 mg / kg twice daily, whereby the majority of the patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2040">There was no low dose of Ritonavir at the same time; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one (78%) or two (42%) of the NRTIs combined with Agenerase.</seg>
<seg id="2041">After 48 weeks approximately 25% of the patients included in the study had a plasma-HIV-1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9% &lt; 400 copies / ml of a median increase in the CD4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ (n = 74) compared to the initial value.</seg>
<seg id="2042">"" "19 Based on this data, the expected benefit of" "" "unspent" "" "Agenerase should be considered in the treatment optimisation with PI pretreated children." ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">After oral administration, the mean duration (Tmax) to the maximum serum concentration of amprenavir is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution.</seg>
<seg id="2044">If Ritonavir (100 mg twice a day) was administered together with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily), it increases by 30%.</seg>
<seg id="2045">The administration of amprenavir with a meal leads to a 25% decrease in the AUC, but has no effect on the concentration of amprenavir 12 hours after dosage (C12).</seg>
<seg id="2046">Therefore, the minimum concentration in the Steady State (Cmin, ss) remained unaffected by the intake of food, although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resorption.</seg>
<seg id="2047">The apparent division volume is approximately 430 lbs (6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg) and allows a large distribution volume as well as an unobstructed penetration of amprenavir from the bloodstream into the tissue.</seg>
<seg id="2048">This change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma, whereby the amount of unbound amprenavir, which represents the active part, probably remains unchanged.</seg>
<seg id="2049">While the absolute concentration of unbound amprenavir remains constant, the percentage share of the free active constituent fluctuates during the dosing interval as a function of the total drug concentration in the Steady State over the range of Cmax, ss to cmin, ss.</seg>
<seg id="2050">Therefore, drugs that induce or inhibit CYP3E or present a substrate of CYP3A4 must be administered cautiously if they are given at the same time with Agenerase (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2051">The gift of Agenerase capsules, either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day, leads to a similar daily amprenavir exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily.</seg>
<seg id="2052">Amprenavir is from the solution 14% less bioavailable than from the capsules; hence, Agenerase Solution and Agenerase Capsules are not interchangeable on a milligrammbasis.</seg>
<seg id="2053">The renal clearance of ritonavir is also negligible, therefore the effect of renal dysfunction could be limited to the elimination of amprenavir and kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2054">These treatment schemes result in amprenavir plasma levels compared to those obtained twice a day in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of amprenavir without the simultaneous administration of kritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="2055">In long-term studies on carcinogenicity with amprenavir in mice and rats, hepatocellular adenomas occured in dosages, which corresponded to the 2.0-fold (mice) or 3.8 times (rat) of exposure to humans, after twice daily administration of 1200 mg of amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2056">The underlying mechanism for the development of hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas has not yet been clarified and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear.</seg>
<seg id="2057">However, there were few indications of the clinical relevance of these findings from the present exposure data on humans, both from clinical studies and from the therapeutic application.</seg>
<seg id="2058">In a standard battery of in-vivo- and in-vitro gene otoxicity tests, the bacterial reverse mutation tests (Ames-Test), mouse lymphom test, microkernel test on rats and chromosomal aberrations on human peripheral lymphocytes, amprenavir was neither mutagenic nor genotoxic.</seg>
<seg id="2059">This liver toxicity can be monitored and verified in the clinical routine by measuring AST, ALT and the activity of alkaline phosphatase.</seg>
<seg id="2060">Until now, no significant liver toxicity has been observed in patients neither during the administration of the treatment or after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2061">Studies on toxicity in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality in both the control animals and the animals treated with amprenavir.</seg>
<seg id="2062">In systemic plasma exposure, which was significantly below (rabbits) or not significantly higher (rats) than the expected exposure to humans, however, a number of minor changes including thymus ongation and minor skeletal changes were observed that indicate delayed development.</seg>
<seg id="2063">24 If Agenerase capsules are applied without the addition of ritonavir (boosters), higher doses of Agenerase (1200 mg twice daily) must be applied.</seg>
<seg id="2064">The recommended dose for Agenerase capsules is 20 mg of amprenavir / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other antiretroviral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg amprenavir, which should not be exceeded (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Simultaneous use should be performed in patients with weak or slight liver function disorder, in patients with severe liver dysfunction they are contraindicated (see Section 4.3).</seg>

<seg id="2072">Dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of amprenavir and kaletra can not be given, but close-meshed monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known.</seg>
<seg id="2073">The treatment with Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors would decrease.</seg>
<seg id="2074">If these medicines are used together, caution is required; a thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be performed, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirus is difficult.</seg>

<seg id="2078">With simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with Agenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of attenuation or reinforcement of the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2079">The simultaneous administration of ortho-novum 1 / 35 (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 1,0 mg norethindrone) resulted in a decrease of AUC and Cmin from Amprenavir by 22% respectively.</seg>

<seg id="2197">If it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of local skin reactions, a treatment break may be made from several days.</seg>
<seg id="2198">The clinical outcome of the treatment can be assessed after the recovery of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2199">As currently no data on long-term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment are available, other appropriate forms of therapy should be taken into consideration in case of super-deficient basal cell carcinomas.</seg>
<seg id="2200">No clinical experiences are available in patients with recurrent and pre-treated BCCs, therefore the application is not recommended in pre-treated tumors.</seg>
<seg id="2201">Data from an open clinical study indicates that large tumors (&gt; 7.25 cm2) have a lower likelihood of response to imiquimod therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2202">Imiquimod was not examined for the treatment of actinic keratoses on eyelids, in the inside of the nose or in the ears or on the lip area inside the lipid.</seg>
<seg id="2203">Very limited data is available on the use of imiquimod for treatment of actinic keratoses in anatomical places outside the face and scalp.</seg>
<seg id="2204">The available data on the actinic keratose on the lower arms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this application, therefore such an application is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2205">Local skin reactions occur frequently, but these reactions usually take off in intensity over therapy or go back after replacing the therapy with Imiquimod Cream.</seg>
<seg id="2206">If the local skin reactions cause large discomfort or are very strong for the patient, the treatment may be suspended for several days.</seg>
<seg id="2207">The data from an open clinical study showed that patients with more than 8 lesions showed lower healing rates than patients with less than 8 lesions.</seg>
<seg id="2208">Due to the immune-stimulating properties, imiquimod cream should be applied with care in patients who receive an immunosuppressive treatment (see 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2209">Animal studies have no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, delivery or postnatal development (see 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2210">Although the serum levels (&gt; 5ng / ml) are not quantifiable after one-time use, no recommendation can be given to the application during the lactation period.</seg>
<seg id="2211">The most common adverse events associated with the application of imiquimod-cream in the studies with three-week treatment were local reactions at the location of the treatment of the genital warts (33.7% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2212">The most frequently reported and probably or possibly associated with the application of the Imiquimod Cream regarding side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.1%.</seg>
<seg id="2213">The reported side-effects reported by 185 with imiquimod-cream from a placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study are described below.</seg>
<seg id="2214">The most common side effect, probably or possibly associated with the application of the imiquimod crème, was in these studies a response to the application site (22% of patients treated with imiquimod).</seg>
<seg id="2215">The side effects reported by 252 in placebo-controlled clinical trials of phase III with Imiquimod-cream treated patients with actinic keratose are listed below.</seg>
<seg id="2216">According to the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan, placebo-controlled clinical trials with imiquimod crème often lead to local skin reactions including erythema (61%), erosion (30%), eccoriation / leaf-off (23%) and edema (14%) (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2217">According to the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan, these studies often showed severe erythema (31%), severe erosions (13%) in these studies with five times weekly treatment, and severe scoring and narrowing (19%).</seg>
<seg id="2218">In clinical trials for the treatment of imiquimod for the treatment of the actinic keratose, alopecia with a frequency of 0.4% (5 / 1214) was found at the treatment centre or in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="2219">The accidental single oral absorption of 200 mg of imiquimod, which corresponds to the contents of about 16 bags, could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, myalgia and fever.</seg>
<seg id="2220">The clinically serious side effect that occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg consisted in hypotonia which normalized after oral or IV fluids.</seg>
<seg id="2221">In a pharmacokinetic study, systemic concentrations of alpha interferon and other cytokines have been demonstrated after topical use of imiquimod.</seg>
<seg id="2222">In 3 pivotal Phase 3 efficacy studies it was shown that efficacy with regard to full healing of the genital warts in an imiquimod treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is clearly superior.</seg>
<seg id="2223">In 60% of the total number of patients who had been treated with Imiquimod, the patients were completely healed; this was the case with 20% of the patients who had been treated with placebo (95% CI):</seg>
<seg id="2224">A complete healing could be achieved at 23% of 157 with Imiquimod treated male patients, compared to 5% of 161 patients treated with placebo (95% CI:</seg>
<seg id="2225">The efficacy of Imiquimod in five times a week over 6 weeks was studied in two double-blind placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2226">The target tumors were histologically confirmed single primary supernormal basal cell carcinomas with a minimum size of 0.5 cm2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm.</seg>
<seg id="2227">Data from an open, uncontrolled long-term study after four years show that approximately 79.3% [95% CI (73.7%, 84.9%)] of all treated patients were clinically cured and this continued for 48 months.</seg>
<seg id="2228">The efficacy of Imiquimod with three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks, interrupted by a four-week treatment free period, was examined in two double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical studies.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Patients had clinically typical, visible, discrete, non-hypertrophic act lesions within a connected 25 cm2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scalp or face.</seg>
<seg id="2230">The single-year data from two combined monitoring studies indicate a recurrent rate of 27% (35 / 128 patients) for patients with clinical treatment after one or two treatment periods.</seg>
<seg id="2231">The permitted indications of external figs, actinic keratose and superficient basal cell carcinoma usually do not occur in paediatric patients and were therefore not examined.</seg>
<seg id="2232">Aldara cream was studied in four randomised, double-blind placebo-controlled studies of children between 2 and 15 years old with Molluscum contagiosum (imiquimod n = 576, placebo n = 313).</seg>
<seg id="2233">The efficacy of Imiquimod could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated (3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or less.</seg>
<seg id="2234">A minimal systemic absorption of 5% imiquimod crème with the skin of 58 patients with actinic keratose was observed during the three-week application during 16 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2235">The highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and totaled 0.1, 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml in the face (12,5 mg, 1 disposable pouch), on the scalp (25 mg, 2 bags) and on the hands / arms (75 mg, 6 bags).</seg>
<seg id="2236">The calculated apparent half-life time was about 10 times higher than the half-life time after subcutaneous use in an earlier study; this indicates prolonged retention of the drug in the skin.</seg>
<seg id="2237">The systemic exposure data showed that the resorption of imiquimodine after topical application on MC-affected skin of patients at the age of 6-12 was low and comparable to that of healthy adults and adults with actinic keratose or supernatural basal cell carcinoma.</seg>
<seg id="2238">In a four-month study of dermal toxicity at rat, doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased spleen weight; a study carried out for the dermal application for four months also showed no similar effects in the mouse.</seg>
<seg id="2239">A two-year study of carcinogenicity in mice on three days a week did not induce tumors in the application area.</seg>
<seg id="2240">The corresponding mechanism is not known, but since imiquimod has only a low systemic absorption of the human skin and is not mutagenic, there is a risk for the human being due to the systemic exposure as very low.</seg>
<seg id="2241">The tumors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active-free cream earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower UVR.</seg>

<seg id="2271">Aldurazyme is used for enzyme substitute therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I; α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the condition (the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves).</seg>
<seg id="2272">This means that certain substances (glycosaminoglycans, gags) cannot be broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them.</seg>
<seg id="2273">The following neurological symptoms of the MPS I can occur: enlarged liver, stiff joints, the motions more difficult, decreased lung volume, heart and eye diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2274">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2275">The administration of Aldurazyme should take place in a hospital or clinic with revitalizing devices, and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction.</seg>

<seg id="2277">The study mainly examined the safety of the drug, but its effectiveness has also been measured (by examining its effect regarding the reduction of GAG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver).</seg>
<seg id="2278">In children under the age of five Aldurazyme decreased the GAG concentrations in the urine by about 60%, and half of the treated children showed a normal large liver at the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2279">The most common side effects of Aldurazyme in patients aged over five years (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) include headache, nausea, abdominal pain, rash, arthropathy (joint pain), arthropathy (joint pain), back pain, fever and reactions at the infusion site.</seg>
<seg id="2280">Very common side effects in patients under five years of age are increased blood pressure, reduced oxygen saturation (a measurement of lung function), tachycardia (accelerated heart rate), fever and chills.</seg>
<seg id="2281">Aldurazyme may not be used in patients who may react strongly hypersensitive (allergic) to laronidase or any of the other components (anaphylactic reactions).</seg>
<seg id="2282">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review all new information that may be known each year and, if necessary, update this summary.</seg>
<seg id="2283">The manufacturer of Aldurazyme will observe patients who receive Aldurazyme regarding the reactions to the infusion and the development of antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2284">In June 2003, the European Commission issued approval to the company Genzyme Europe B.V. for the marketing of Aldurazyme in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2285">Laronidase is a recombinant form of human α -L-Iduronidase and is produced using recombinant DNA technology using CHO mammoth cell cultures (Chinese hamster Ovary, derived from the Chinese hamster).</seg>
<seg id="2286">Aldurazyme is indicated for long-term enzyme substitute therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mucopolysaccharidosis I (MPS I, α -L-Iduronidase deficiency) in order to treat the non-neurological manifestations of the disease (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2287">The treatment with Aldurazyme should be performed by a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with MPS I or other inherited metabolic disorders.</seg>
<seg id="2288">The initial infusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2289">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2290">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme in patients with kidney or liver failure has not been determined and no dosage schedule can be recommended for these patients.</seg>
<seg id="2291">Patients treated with Aldurazyme can develop infusion-related reactions that are defined as any side effects that occur during infusion or until the end of the infusion day (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2292">For this reason, these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the infusion of Aldurazyme should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical setting in which revitational facilities for medical emergencies are immediately available.</seg>
<seg id="2293">Due to the clinical phase 3 study, it is expected that almost all patients form IgG antibodies against laronidase, usually within 3 months from the start of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2294">Patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an infusion-related reaction must be treated with care when using Aldurazyme (see sections 4.3 and 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2295">As there is little experience in the resumption of treatment after a longer break, the theoretically increased risk of hypersensitivity reactions after an interruption of the treatment must be cautiously advised.</seg>
<seg id="2296">60 minutes before the start of infusion with medication (antihistaminika and / or antipyreka) to minimize the potential occurrence of infusion-related reactions.</seg>
<seg id="2297">In the case of a mild or moderate infusion-related reaction, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen should be considered and / or a reduction in infusion rate to half of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2298">In the event of a single, severe infusion-related reaction, the infusion must be stopped until the symptoms are reduced, treatment with antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen is to be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2299">The infusion can be resumed with a reduction in infusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the reaction occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2300">3. (antihistamines and paracetamol / ibuprofen and / or corticosteroids) as well as a reduction in infusion rates to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the infusion rate in which the previous response has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2301">Aldurazyme should not be used simultaneously with Chloroquin or Procain, because a potential risk of interference with the intracellular attachment of Laronidase exists.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy that include embryonic / fetal development, birth and postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2303">Since no data is present on newborns exposed to laronidase via breast milk, it is recommended not to breastfeed during treatment with Aldurazyme.</seg>
<seg id="2304">Adverse events in clinical studies were mainly observed as infusion-related reactions, which were observed in 53% of patients in the Phase 3 study (duration up to 4 years) and 35% of patients in the study with participants under 5 years (duration of treatment up to 1 year).</seg>
<seg id="2305">Adverse drug reactions related to Aldurazyme, which were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 or older during a treatment period of up to 4 years, are very common in the following table (≥ 1 / 100); frequently (≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10).</seg>
<seg id="2306">In some patients with severe MPS-I-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, severe reactions including bronchospasm, breathing stops and facial oils (see section 4.4) also occurred.</seg>
<seg id="2307">Children Unwanted drug effects associated with Aldurazyme, which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years, with predominantly severe trial form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months, are listed in the table.</seg>
<seg id="2308">100 E / kg intravenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2309">In most patients it came to a serum version within 3 months of the beginning of the treatment. in the age of 5 patients with a more severe follow-up form usually came to a serum version within one month (average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 years and over).</seg>
<seg id="2310">Up to the end of the Phase 3 study (or up to a premature withdrawal from the study) no antibodies could be detected in 13 / 45 patients (RIP) assay, among them 3 patients with whom there has never been a serum version.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the GAG level in urine, while a variable decrease of GAG in urine was detected in patients with high antibody titres.</seg>
<seg id="2312">Four patients (three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study) showed a marginal to low neutralizing inhibitory effect on enzymatic laronidase- activity in vitro that did not seem to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of GAG in urine.</seg>
<seg id="2313">The presence of antibodies did not appear to be associated with the incidence of adverse drug reactions, although the occurrence of undesirable drug reactions typically coincided with the formation of IgG antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2314">The reason for the enumeration therapy is one for the hydrolysis of the accumulative substratum and the prevention of further accumulation sufficient restoration of enzymatic activity.</seg>
<seg id="2315">After IV infusion, Laronidase is rapidly removed from the circulation and cells absorbed into the lysosomes, most likely using mannose-6 phosphate receptors.</seg>
<seg id="2316">The safety and efficacy of Aldurazyme were studied in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study in 45 patients aged 6 to 43.</seg>
<seg id="2317">Although patients were recruited for the study, which showed the entire spectrum of disease, the majority of patients were of the mean phenotype and only one patient showed the severe phenotype.</seg>
<seg id="2318">Patients were recruited if they had a forced expiratory volume (FeV) of less than 80% of the expected value, and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters.</seg>
<seg id="2319">The primary endpoints for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FeV and the total distance in the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2320">All patients were subsequently recruited for an open-label extension study where they received 100 E / kg of Aldurazyme every week for 3.5 years (182 weeks).</seg>
<seg id="2321">After 26 weeks of therapy, patients treated with Aldurazyme showed improvement of lung function and ability to be treated in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2322">The open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Aldurazyme / Aldurazyme group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / aldurazyme group as shown in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2323">The decrease in the expected percentage of FeV is clinically not significant over this period and the total lung volumes increased proportionally to the size of adults.</seg>
<seg id="2324">Of the 26 patients with a Hepatomegaly prior to treatment 22 (85%) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2325">Within the first 4 weeks, a clear waste of the GAG-Spiegel in the urine (µg / mg Kreatinin) was observed, which remained constant until the end of the study.</seg>
<seg id="2326">In terms of the heterogeneous disease manifestation between the patients taking into consideration clinically significant changes across five efficacy variables (expected percentage of normal FeV, distance in the 6-minute hearing, motion range of the shoulder joint AHI and visual acuity), there was generally no improvement in 26 patients (22%) and a deterioration in 9 patients (20%).</seg>
<seg id="2327">A one-year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmacokinetics of Aldurazyme were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years of age at the time of their inclusion (16 patients with severe forms and 4 with medium delay).</seg>
<seg id="2328">In four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased Gag- Mirror in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2329">In several patients a size growth (n = 7) and a weight gain (n = 3) was determined after the Z-Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe disease (&lt; 2,5 years) and all 4 patients with the mean follow-up form showed normal mental development speed whereas in the older patients with severe forms of course there were limited or no progress in cognitive development.</seg>
<seg id="2330">In a phase-4 study, studies on pharmacodynamic effects of various Aldurazyme dosage schemes were carried out onto the GAG level in urine, liver volume and the 6-minute hearing test.</seg>
<seg id="2331">100 E / kg intravenous once weekly (recommended dose), 200 E / kg intravenous once weekly, 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intravenously every 2 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="2332">The dosing schedule with 200 E / kg intravenous every 2 weeks can represent a reasonable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly infusions; however, it is not proven that the long-term clinical effectiveness of these two dosing schemes is equivalent.</seg>
<seg id="2333">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the summary of the features of the drug will be updated.</seg>

<seg id="2349">In some patients with severe MPS-IX-related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre-history, severe reactions occurred, including bronchospasm, breathing stops and facial oils.</seg>
<seg id="2350">Very common (occurrence at more than 1 out of 10 patients): • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • joint disease, joint pain, back pain, pain in the arms and legs • Erröten • fever • less oxygen in the blood • Reaction at the infusion site</seg>
<seg id="2351">The European Medicines Agency (EMEA) will review any new information available annually, and if necessary, the package will be updated.</seg>
<seg id="2352">If the ready-to-use preparation is not immediately used, it is no longer than 24 hours at 2 ° C - 8º C, provided the dilution was done under controlled and validated aseptic conditions.</seg>

<seg id="2354">Alimta is used together with cisplatin (another anti-cancer drug) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy (cancer drugs) and "maligne" (malignant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body) and is likely to spread easily to other parts of the body.</seg>
<seg id="2355">Agmica is used in patients who have not previously been treated in combination with cisplatin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapies as sole therapy.</seg>
<seg id="2356">In order to reduce side effects, patients should receive a corticosteroid as well as folic acid (a vitamin) during the treatment with Alimta and receive injections of vitamin B12.</seg>
<seg id="2357">If Alimta is administered together with cisplatin, before or after the application of cisplatin, an "antibody" (medicines for vomiting) and fluids (to prevent dehydration) should be given before or after the application of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In patients whose blood type changes or certain other side effects occur, the treatment should be postponed, stopped or the dose should be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2359">The active form of pemetremixed thus slows the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from dividing.</seg>
<seg id="2360">The transformation of pemetremixed into its active form occurs more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells, leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer duration in cancer cells.</seg>
<seg id="2361">For the treatment of the malignant pleural efferothelioma, Alimta was examined in a major study of 456 patients who had not received chemotherapy for their disease before.</seg>
<seg id="2362">In the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, the effects of Alimta in a study of 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease, previously treated with chemotherapy, were compared with the effects of docetaxel (another medicine for cancer).</seg>
<seg id="2363">Alimta was also compared to gemcitabine (another anti-cancer drug), both in combination with cisplatin in a study of 1,725 patients who previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2364">Patients treated with aplita and cisplatin lived on average 12.1 months compared to 9.3 months in the sole administration of cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2365">In patients who had previously received chemotherapy, the average survival time was 8.3 months compared to 7.9 months at docetaxel.</seg>
<seg id="2366">In both studies, however, patients with whom the cancer did not attack the squamous epithelial cells showed longer survival times in the administration of aplita than with the medication.</seg>
<seg id="2367">In September 2004, the European Commission issued approval to the company Eli Lilly Nederland B.V. for the marketing of the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2368">Each water bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml. of 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml), which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml.</seg>
<seg id="2369">The corresponding volume of the necessary dose is removed from the flow bottle and diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride injection solution (9 mg / ml) to 100 ml (see Section 6.6).</seg>
<seg id="2370">ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin for first-line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, except for predominant plate epithelial histology (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2371">ALIMTA in monotherapy is indicated for the treatment in second-line treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2372">The recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² body surface (KOF) is administered intravenously for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2373">The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg / m ² KOF as infusion for a period of 2 hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the Pemetrexed- infusion on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2374">In patients with non-small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy, the recommended dose of ALIMTA 500 mg / m ² KOF is administered as intravenous infusion for a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21-day treatment cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2375">To reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions, a corticosteroid must be given the day before and on the day of the mixed-mixed gift as well as on the day after the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2376">During the seven days before the first dose of pemetrexed, at least 5 doses of folic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the treatment period as well as for another 21 days following the last Pemetrexed- dose.</seg>
<seg id="2377">Patients must also receive an intramuscular injection of vitamin B12 (1000 mcg) in the week before the first pemetremixed dose as well as after every third action cycle.</seg>
<seg id="2378">In patients receiving pemetremixed, a complete hemorrhage should be produced before each application, including a differentiation of the leukocytes and platelet counting.</seg>
<seg id="2379">Alkaline phosphatase (AP), aspartate transaminase (AST or SGOT) and Alanin-Transaminase (ALT or SGPT) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value.</seg>
<seg id="2380">A dose testing must take place at the beginning of a new treatment cycle taking account of the presence of the blood or the maximum non-hematological toxicity of the previous therapy cycles.</seg>
<seg id="2381">After the recovery, patients must be treated according to the indications in the tables 1, 2 and 3, which are used for ALIMTA as monotherapy or in combination with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2382">These criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC v2.0; NCI 1998) ≥ CTC degree 2 bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2383">Should patients not develop hematological toxicity ≥ level 3 (except neurotoxicity), the therapy must be interrupted with ALIMTA until the patient has the value before the treatment</seg>
<seg id="2384">Treatment with ALIMTA needs to be terminated if a hematological toxicity or non-haematological toxicity level 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose reductio- or so - in the case of Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity.</seg>
<seg id="2385">Clinical studies showed no indication that in patients with age 65% or above 65 years of age, there is an increased risk of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2386">ALIMTA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy.</seg>
<seg id="2387">In clinical trials, no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a creatinin clearance of ≥ 45 ml / min which go beyond the dose adjustments recommended to all patients.</seg>
<seg id="2388">The data situation in patients with a creatinin clearance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient; therefore, the application is not recommended (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2389">However, patients with a liver function of &gt; 1.5 times the upper limit value and / or transaminase values of &gt; the 3.0 times the upper limit value (in case of liver metastases) or &gt; 5.0-times the upper limit value (in the presence of liver metastases) were not specifically studied in the studies.</seg>
<seg id="2390">Patients need to be monitored with respect to bone metastasis and Pemetrexed should not be given to patients before absolute neutrophils have reached a value of ≥ 100 cells / mm ³ and the thrombocyte number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Dose reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadir of the absolute number of neutrophils, thrombocyte number and maximum non-haematological toxicity observed in the previous treatment cycles (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2392">A lower toxicity and a reduction of grade 3 / 4 haematological and niecatological toxicity, such as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and infection with degree 3 / 4 neutropenia was beacomised when a pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Therefore, all patients treated with pemetrexed must be instructed to use folic acid and vitamin B12 as a prophylactic measure to reduce treatment-related toxicity (see section 4.2).</seg>
<seg id="2394">Patients with mild to medium renal insufficiency (creatinin-clearances 45 to 79 ml / min) must avoid the simultaneous intake of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs) for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2395">All patients prescribed for therapy with pemetrexed must avoid taking NSAIDs with a long half-life time for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2396">Many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of renal events, including dehydration, preexisting high blood pressure or diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="2397">For this reason, a drainage of the effluent before pemetremixed treatment is to be considered in patients with clinically significant fluid accumulation in the transcellular space.</seg>
<seg id="2398">5 Several cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular events were reported in clinical trials with pemetreb occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2399">For this reason, the simultaneous application of attenuated live vaccine (except yellow fever, this vaccination is contraindicated) is not recommended (see Section 4.3 and 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2400">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive ability is made by means of pemetremixed, men should be advised to seek advice on the conservation of sperm before the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2401">In patients with normal kidney function (Kreatinin-Clearance ≥ 80 ml / min) high doses of nonsteroidal antiphlogistica (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen &gt; 1600 mg / day) and acetylsalicylic acid in high doses (≥ 1.3 g a day) may result in reduced pemetremixed elimination with the result of increased occurrence of side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2402">Therefore, caution is required if high doses of NSAIDs or Ace- tylsalicylic acid are applied in high doses in patients with normal kidney function (creatinin-clearances ≥ 80 ml / min).</seg>
<seg id="2403">Ibuprofen) or acetylsalicylic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetrexed are avoided (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2404">Since no data exists regarding the interaction potential with NSAIDs with long half-life such as Piro- xicam or Rofecoxib, the simultaneous application with pemetrexed must be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy, on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with pemetre- xed.</seg>
<seg id="2405">The great intra-individual variability of coagulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anticoagulants and antineoplastic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the INR (International Regular Ratio) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anticoagulants.</seg>
<seg id="2406">There are no data for the use of pemetremixed in pregnant women but as with ande- ren antimetabolites severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy.</seg>
<seg id="2407">Pemetrexed cannot be used during pregnancy except if it is absolutely necessary and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the foetus (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2408">Since the possibility of irreversible damage to reproductive ability is made by means of pemetremixed, men should be advised prior to the commencement of the treatment to obtain advice on the blocking of the sperm cells.</seg>
<seg id="2409">It is not known whether pemetremixed is transferred into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breastfed baby cannot be excluded.</seg>
<seg id="2410">The following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse events reported in &gt; 5% of 168 patients with mesothelioma and the randomised cisplatin and pemetrexed as well as 163 patients with mesothelioma who were randomized to receive cisplatin as monotherapy.</seg>

<seg id="2419">Clinically relevant toxicity level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 in the summarized results of three individual pemetremixed mono therapy studies, excluding neutropenia (12.8% compared to 5.3%) and an increase in alanine transaminase (15.2% compared to 1.9%).</seg>
<seg id="2420">These differences are likely to be traced back to differences in patient population, as the Pha- se 2 studies included both chemonaive and clearly pre-treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metastases and / or abnormal initial values of liver function tests.</seg>

<seg id="2426">Serious cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events, including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, cerebrovascular insulin and transitory ischemic attacks were reported in acute clinical studies using pemetremixed, which is usually administered in combination with another cytotoxic substance.</seg>
<seg id="2427">In clinical studies, patients with mixed-treatment were occasionally reported cases of coligitis (including intestinal and rectal bleeding, sometimes fatal intestinal perforation, intestinal necrosis and typhlitis).</seg>
<seg id="2428">From clinical studies, patients with pemetremixed treatment have occasionally reported cases of sometimes fatal interstitial pneumonitis with respiratory failure.</seg>
<seg id="2429">It was reported on cases of acute renal failure in pemetremixed monotherapy or in combination with other chemotherapeutics (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2430">Cases of radiation pneumonitis were reported in patients who were beamed before, during or after their pemetremixed therapy (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2431">ALIMTA (Pemetremixed) is antineoplastic antic which exerts its effect by breaking weight-dependent metaboric processes necessary for cell replication.</seg>
<seg id="2432">In vitro studies showed that pemetremixed acts as an anti-folate with several attack points by blocking the thymidylatoxthase (TS), Dihydrological reductase (DHFR) and glycine amidribonucleotidfor- myltransferase (GARFT), which are the following key enzymes of the de novo biosynthesis of thymid- and purinnucleotides.</seg>
<seg id="2433">EMPHACIS, a multicenter, randomized, simple-blind Phase 3 study of ALIMTA plus cisplatin versus cisplatin at chemonaiven patients with malignant pleural efferothelioma showed a clinically significant benefit of a median 2.8-month extended survival compared to those patients who were only covered with cisplatin.</seg>
<seg id="2434">The primary analysis of this study was performed in the population of all patients who received the investigational medicine in the treatment arm (randomised and treated).</seg>
<seg id="2435">A statistically significant improvement of clinically relevant symptoms (pain and dyspnea) related to the malignant pleural retina was shown in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm (212 patients) in relation to the sole Cispla- tin arm (218 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2436">The differences between the two arms resulted from an improvement of the lung function parameters in the ALIMTA / Cisplatin arm and a worsening of lung function over time in the control arm.</seg>
<seg id="2437">A multicenter, randomised, open phase III study with ALIMTA in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC advanced median survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with ALIMTA (Intent to treat population n = 283) and from 7.9 months in patients treated with docetaxel (ITT n = 288).</seg>

<seg id="2505">If these enzymes are inhibited, they can't break down some fats in the food, causing about a quarter of the fats that are added to the food undigested to the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2506">In a third study Alli was compared to placebo in 391 obese patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2507">In both studies in patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2, patients who received an average weight loss of 4.8 kg after one year had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo.</seg>
<seg id="2508">In the study of allergy in patients with BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2, no significant weight loss could be observed for patients.</seg>
<seg id="2509">The most common side effects of Alli (observed in more than 1 of 10 patients) are oily spots at the anus, flare (winds) with a bowel finish, bowel strand, oily / oily chair, leaving oily secretion (putts), flatulence (winds) and soft chairs.</seg>
<seg id="2510">It must not be used in patients treated with Ciclosporin (to prevent organ rejection in patients with transplants) or with medicines such as warfarin to prevent blood clots.</seg>
<seg id="2511">It must not be used in patients suffering from long-term malabsorption (in which insufficient nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract) or cholestase (liver disease), and for pregnant women or for nursing mothers.</seg>
<seg id="2512">In July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Limited for placing Orlistat GSK in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2513">Alli is indexed for weight loss of adults with overweight (Body-Mass-Index BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypotheorical, fatty diet.</seg>
<seg id="2514">Alli should not be used by children and adolescents under 18 because there are not enough data on efficacy and safety.</seg>
<seg id="2515">As orlistat is only minimally absorbed, no adjustment of the dosage is necessary in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function.</seg>
<seg id="2516">Hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other components • Simultaneous malabsorption (see section 4.5) • Chronic malabsorption syndrome • Cholestase • pregnancy (see section 4.6) • Nursing time (see section 4.6) • Simultaneous treatment with warfarin or other oral anticoagulants (see sections 4.5 and 4.8)</seg>
<seg id="2517">The likelihood of occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms (see section 4.8) can increase if alli is taken together with a fat-rich single meal or fat-rich diet.</seg>
<seg id="2518">As weight loss can be associated with improved metabolic control, patients who have a diabetes medicine should consult a doctor or pharmacist before starting a therapy with alli, because the dosage of the antidiabetic should be adapted if necessary.</seg>
<seg id="2519">Patients who have alli as well as medicines for high blood pressure or high cholesterol should ask their doctor or pharmacist whether the dosage of these medicines needs to be adapted.</seg>
<seg id="2520">It is recommended to take additional pregnant-contraceptive measures in order to prevent the possible failure of oral contraception in case of severe diarrhoea (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2521">Both in a study on drug interactions as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of orlistat and ciclosporine, a lowering of the Ciclosporin plasma level was observed.</seg>
<seg id="2522">In the application of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants in combination with orlistat, the quick values (international normal ratio, INR) could be influenced (see section 4.8).</seg>
<seg id="2523">In most patients treated with orlistat in clinical studies up to 4 full years, the concentrations of vitamins A, D, E and K and beta carotene remained in the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2524">However, patients should be advised to take supplements of multivitamin preparations before bedtime to ensure sufficient vitamin intake (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2525">A marginal decrease of the Amiodarone plasma concentration was observed in a limited number of healthy volunteers who received orlistat at the same time after the administration of a single dose of Amiodarone.</seg>
<seg id="2526">Animal studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2527">The side effects of orlistat are mainly gastrointestinal nature and are related to the pharmacological effect of the medicine as the absorption of biased fat is prevented.</seg>
<seg id="2528">Gastrointestinal side effects were determined from clinical studies of orlistat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary.</seg>
<seg id="2529">The frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10), occasionally (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100), rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000, &lt; 1 / 1000) and very rarely (≥ 1 / 10.000), not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2530">The incidence of known side effects reported after the market launch of orlistat is unknown since these events were voluntarily reported by a population of some magnitude.</seg>
<seg id="2531">† It is plausible that the treatment with alli can lead to anxiety in terms of possible or actual gastrointestinal side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2532">Single doses of 800 mg of orlistat and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obese subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings occurring.</seg>
<seg id="2533">In the majority of cases reported after the market launch of orlistat overdosage, no side effects or similar side effects were reported as reported at the recommended dose of orlistat.</seg>
<seg id="2534">Based on tests on humans and animals, a rapid recovery of any systemic effects caused by orlistat's lipiantic properties can be assumed.</seg>
<seg id="2535">The therapeutic effect settles in the lumen of the stomach and the upper small intestine through covalent bond to the active Serb-rest of the gastrian and pankretic lipasen.</seg>
<seg id="2536">From clinical studies it was derived that 60 mg of orlistat, taken three times a day, blocks the absorption of about 25% of the dietary fat.</seg>
<seg id="2537">Two double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled studies on adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 show the efficacy of 60 mg of orlistat, which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypokalory, fatty diet.</seg>
<seg id="2538">The primary parameter, the change in body weight compared to the initial value (at the time of randomisation), was assessed as follows: as a change in body weight in the course of study (table 1) and as a percentage of those participating in study who lost more than 5% or more than 10% of their initial weight (table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2539">Although in both studies weight reduction was observed over 12 months, the biggest weight loss occurred during the first 6 months.</seg>
<seg id="2540">The mean change in the Gesamtcholesterin was 60 mg -2.4% (baseline 5.20 mmol / l) and with placebo + 2.8% (baseline 5.26 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2541">The average change in LDL cholesterol was 60 mg -3.5% (baseline: 3,30 mmol / l) and placebo + 3.8% (baseline: 3.41 mmol / l).</seg>
<seg id="2542">At waist circumference the average change was -4.5 cm with orlistat 60 mg (initial value 103.7 cm) and with placebo -3.6 cm (initial value 103.5 cm).</seg>
<seg id="2543">Plasma concentrations of non-metabolized orlistat were not measurable 8 hours after oral administration of 360 mg orlistat (&lt; 5 ng / ml).</seg>
<seg id="2544">7 In general, non-metabolized orlistat in plasma was only sporadic and in extremely low concentrations (&lt; 10 ng / ml or 0.02 µmol) and without any indication of accumulation.</seg>
<seg id="2545">Two main metabolites, namely M1 (in position 4 hydrolysed lactonring) and M3 (M1 after cleavage of the N-molyl-leucine-group), were identified in a study with obese patients (M1 after cleavage of the N-molyl-leucine-group), representing approximately 42% of the total plasma concentration.</seg>
<seg id="2546">Based on the conventional studies on safety harmacology, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data does not allow any particular danger to humans.</seg>

<seg id="2609">The efficacy of Aloxi can be increased by adding a corticosteroids (a medicine that can be used as an antiemic).</seg>
<seg id="2610">The use of patients under the age of 18 is not recommended as there is not enough information about the effects in this age group.</seg>
<seg id="2611">This means that the active agent prevents the binding of a chemical substance in the body, 5 hydroxytryptamin (5HT, also known as serotonin), to the receptors in the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2612">Aloxi was examined in three main studies on 1,842 adults who received chemotherapies, which are strong or moderate to cause nausea and vomiting.</seg>
<seg id="2613">In chemotherapies, which are strong trigger for nausea and vomiting, 59% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (132 of 223), compared to 57% of patients treated with Ondansetron (126 of 221).</seg>
<seg id="2614">In chemotherapies, moderate nausea and vomiting, 81% of patients treated with Aloxi showed no vomiting in 24 hours after chemotherapy (153 of 189), compared to 69% of patients treated with Ondansetron (127 of 185).</seg>
<seg id="2615">In comparison with dolasetron, these values were 63% for Aloxi (119 of 189 patients) and 53% for Dolasetron (101 of 191 patients).</seg>
<seg id="2616">In March 2005, the European Commission granted Helsinki Birex Pharmaceuticals Ltd. approval for the marketing of Aloxi throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2617">Aloxi is indexed: to prevent acute nausea and vomiting in strong emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer and to prevent nausea and vomiting in moderately emetogenic chemotherapy due to cancer.</seg>
<seg id="2618">The effectiveness of Aloxi for the prevention of nausea and vomiting induced by a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy can be enhanced by adding a corticosteroids given before chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2619">Since Palonosetron can prolong the colon massage, patients should be closely monitored with anamnestial obstipation or signs of a subacute idiot after injection.</seg>
<seg id="2620">As with other 5HT3 antagonists, however, caution is advised in the simultaneous administration of Palonosetron with medicines that extend the QT interval or in patients with which the Qt- interval is extended or which tend to such an extension.</seg>
<seg id="2621">In addition to chemotherapy, Aloxi is not intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days following chemotherapy.</seg>
<seg id="2622">In preclinical studies, Palonosetron did not inhibit tumor activity of the five chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabins, doxorubicin, and Mitomycin C).</seg>
<seg id="2623">In a clinical study there was no significant pharmacokinetic interaction between a single intravenous dose of Palonosetron and a Steady-State- Concentration oral Metoclopramids, a CYP2D6 inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2624">In a pharmacokinetic analysis based on a population, it was shown that the simultaneous administration of CYP2D6 inductors (dexamethasone and rifampicin) as well as of CYP2D6 inhibitors (Amiodarone, Celecoxib, paroxetine, chinidine, ranitidine, ritonavir, sertraline, and terbinafine) had no significant effect on the clearing of Palonosacron.</seg>
<seg id="2625">There are no experiences for the use of Palonosetron in human pregnancies, therefore Palonosetron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician.</seg>
<seg id="2626">In clinical trials, the most common side effects were observed in a dose of 250 micrograms (a total of 633 patients) associated with Aloxi (9%) and obstipation (5%).</seg>
<seg id="2627">Very rare cases (&lt; 1 / 10,000) of hypersensitivity reactions and reactions to the date of delivery (burning, hardening, discomfort and pain) were reported in post marketing reports.</seg>
<seg id="2628">The group with the highest dose showed similar abundances of adverse events as in other dosing groups; no dose-effect relationships were observed.</seg>
<seg id="2629">No dialysis studies have been carried out, due to the large distribution volume, however, a dialysis is probably not effective therapy for an Aloxi- overdose.</seg>
<seg id="2630">In two randomised double-blind studies, 1,132 patients receiving a moderately emetogenic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 cisplatin, carboplatin, ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mcg / m2 doxorubicin and 250 mg / m2 of dolasetron (half-life 7.3 hours) received intravenously on Day 1 without dexamethasone.</seg>
<seg id="2631">In a randomised double-blind study, 667 patients receiving a strongly emetogenic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclophosphamide and Dacarbazine as well as 250 or 750 micrograms Palonosacron were compared to patients who received 32 mg of Ondansetron, which were given intravenously on day 1.</seg>
<seg id="2632">Results of studies with moderately emetogenic chemotherapy and the study with strong emetogenic chemotherapy are summarized in the following tables.</seg>
<seg id="2633">In clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), the effects of palonosetron on blood pressure, heart rate and ECG parameters including the Qtc interval were comparable with the corresponding effects of ondansetron and dolasetron.</seg>
<seg id="2634">After the findings of pre-clinical investigations, Palonosetron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and to extend the duration of the action potential.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy volunteers was the evaluation of the ECG-effects of intravenous palonosacron in single doses of 0.25, 0.75 and 2.25 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2636">Resorption After IV administration follows an initial decrease of plasma concentrations a slow elimination from the body with an average terminale half-life of about 40 hours.</seg>
<seg id="2637">The average maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the surface under the concentration time curve (AUC0- ∞) are generally dose- proportionally in the whole dose range of 0.390 μ / kg in healthy and cancer patients.</seg>
<seg id="2638">After intravenous administration of Palonosetron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses, the mean (± SD) increase in the Palonosetron plasma concentration between day 1 and day was 42 ± 34%.</seg>
<seg id="2639">Pharmacokinetic simulations show that at once daily intravenous administration of 0.25 mg of Palonosetron was comparable to 3 consecutive days (AUC0- ∞) measured after one-time IV administration of 0.75 mg. however, the Cmax was higher after the one-off rate of 0.75 mg.</seg>
<seg id="2640">About 40% are eliminated through the kidneys and about 50% are converted into two primary metabolites which have less than 1% of the antagonistic effect on the 5HT3 receptor in comparison to Palonosetron.</seg>
<seg id="2641">In vitro studies on metabolism have shown that CYP2D6 and, to a lesser extent, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP1A2 are involved in the metabolism of Palonosacron.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Elimination After an intravenous single dose of 10 micrograms / kg [14C] -Palonosetron, about 80% of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine, Palonosetron as an unchanged active ingredient made about 40% of the given dose.</seg>
<seg id="2643">After a one-time intravenous bolus injection in healthy patients the total length was 173 ± 73 ml / min and the renal clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min.</seg>
<seg id="2644">In patients with severe liver dysfunction, the terminal eliminations and the average systemic exposure to Palonosacron are increased, but a reduction of the dose is not justified.</seg>
<seg id="2645">In preclinical studies, effects were observed only after exposures, which are considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure, suggesting a low relevance for clinical use.</seg>
<seg id="2646">10 out of preclinical studies, indications were that Palonosetron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations, which are involved in ventricular de- and reolarisation and can extend the duration of action.</seg>
<seg id="2647">High doses of palonosacron (each dose corresponded to about 30 times of therapeutic exposure to humans), which were given daily over two years resulted in increased frequency of liver tumours, endocrine neoplasms (in thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal marrow) and skin tumors in rats, but not mice.</seg>
<seg id="2648">The underlying mechanisms are not fully known, but due to the high dosages used and since Aloxi is designed for single use in humans, the relevance of these results is regarded as low for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2649">The holder of this authorisation for placing on the market must inform the European Commission about the plans for placing the drug in the context of this decision.</seg>

<seg id="2660">In June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a negative report in which the announcement of approval for placing the drug prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Alpheon 6 million IE / ml injection solution.</seg>
<seg id="2661">This means that Alpheon should resemble a biological medicine called Roferon-A with the same medicinal ingredient that is already approved in the EU (also called the "reference drug").</seg>
<seg id="2662">Alpheon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic (long-lasting) hepatitis C (a liver disease caused by a viral infection).</seg>
<seg id="2663">In a microscopic investigation, liver tissue damages damage, and the values of the liver enzyme Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in the blood abnormality are increased.</seg>
<seg id="2664">It is produced by a yeast in which a gene (DNA) was introduced that stimulates the formation of the active substance.</seg>
<seg id="2665">The manufacturer of Alpheon used data to demonstrate the comparison of Alpheon with Roferon-A (active substance structure, composition and purity of the drug, mode of action, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C).</seg>
<seg id="2666">In the study of hepatitis C patients the efficacy of Alpheon was compared with the efficacy of the reference drug to 455 patients.</seg>
<seg id="2667">The study measured how many patients responded to the medication after 12 of a total of 48 weeks of treatment and 6 months after the treatment was set (i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood).</seg>
<seg id="2668">(44-20) 74 18 84 16 E-mail: mail @ emea.eu.int Remover the EMEA 2006 Reproduction and / or distribution of this document is Authorised for non commercial purposes only provided by the EMEA is acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="2669">In addition, concerns were raised that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed could not suffice.</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients responding to the treatment with Alpheon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">After the treatment with Alpheon, the disease was reduced to more patients than the reference medicine; moreover, Alpheon had more side effects.</seg>
<seg id="2672">In addition to this, the study used in the study was not adequately validated to determine the extent to which the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug).</seg>
<seg id="2673">It can be used for the treatment of impetigo (skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirings (cracking or cutting), abrasions and sewed wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2674">Altargo is not intended to be used for the treatment of infections that have been demonstrably or probably caused by methicillins resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because alarm against this type of infection may not work.</seg>
<seg id="2675">Altargo can be used in patients with age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age the skin surface to be treated should not be more than 2% of the body's surface.</seg>
<seg id="2676">If the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments.</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and inhibit the growth of the bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of effectiveness in all five studies was the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">119 (85.6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of the 71 patients among placebo responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2680">In the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at home patients, approximately 90% of patients from both groups responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2681">In these two studies, however, it was found that Altargo is not effective enough in treating abscesses (oak-filled cavities in the body tissue) or infections caused by MRSA.</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the surfacing point.</seg>
<seg id="2683">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo during short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections are predominant: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmities, abrasions or sewn wounds.</seg>
<seg id="2684">In May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the placing on the market of Altargo throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">In the case of sensitization or serious local irritation by the use of Retapamoulin Salbe, the treatment is to be broken off, the ointment is carefully wiped off and an appropriate alternative therapy of infection is started.</seg>
<seg id="2687">Retapamulin should not be used for the treatment of infections in which MRSA is known or suspected to be pathogens (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2688">In clinical studies on secondary infected open wounds the efficacy of Retapamulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).</seg>
<seg id="2689">Alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous use of retinobulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous use of other topical drugs is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">Due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical use on peeled skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2).</seg>
<seg id="2692">3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of ketoconazol increased the middle retinobulin AUC (0-24) and Cmax after topical application of 1% Retapamese ointment on skewed skin of healthy adult men by 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2693">Due to the low systemic exposure to topical use in patients, dosage adjustments are not deemed necessary if topical Retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors.</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to the birth and the fetal / postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retinobulin Salbe should only be used during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinobulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">In deciding whether breastfeeding continued / or the therapy should continue with Altargo, it is advisable to weigh between the benefit of breastfeeding for the infant and the benefit of the Altargo therapy for the woman.</seg>
<seg id="2697">In clinical studies of 2150 patients with superficial skin infections that Altargo have applied, the most commonly reported adverse effect was irritation at the date of delivery which concerned about 1% of the patients.</seg>
<seg id="2698">Mode of action Retapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance which is isolated by fermentation from Clitopilus passeckeranus (formerly Pleurotus passeckeranus).</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mechanism of action of Retapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction on a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding sites of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site is involved in the ribosomal protein L3 and lies in the region of the ribosomal P binding site and the peptidyltransferasecenter.</seg>
<seg id="2701">By binding on this binding site, the leuromutiline inhibit peptide transfer, partially obstructing P-binding interactions and prevents the normal formation of active 50s-ribosomal subunits.</seg>
<seg id="2702">If, due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of Retapamulin should appear objectionable at least some infections, advice should be sought by experts.</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of Retapamulin compared to S.aureus, regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">In the case of non-response to the treatment of S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered.</seg>
<seg id="2705">Resorption In a study with healthy adults, 1% retinobulin ointment was applied daily under occlusion to intact and applied skin for up to 7 days.</seg>
<seg id="2706">Out of 516 patients (adults and children) who received 1% Retapamoulin Salbe twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary infected traumatic wounds, individual plasma samples were obtained.</seg>
<seg id="2707">Sampling was performed on days 3 or 4 with adult patients before the medication and the children between 0-12 hours after the last application.</seg>
<seg id="2708">However, maximum individual systemic inclusion on the human being after topical use of 1% ointment on 200 cm2 shaved skin (Cmax = 22 ng / ml; AUC (0-24) = 238 ng · h / ml) 660 times lower than the Retapamulin IC50 for the PGP inhibition.</seg>
<seg id="2709">Metabolism The in vitro oxidative Metabolism of Retapamulin in human liver microsomes was mediated primarily by CYP3a4, with low participation of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2710">In studies of oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg), which were carried out over 14 days, there were signs of adaptive liver and thyroid changes.</seg>
<seg id="2711">In-vitro screening of gene mutation and / or chromosomal effects in the mouse lymph-test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymphocytes and in the rat microkernel test for in vivo study of chromosomal effects.</seg>
<seg id="2712">There were neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility in oral dosages of 50, 150 or 450 mg / kg / day, resulting in an exposure to 5 times higher than the highest estimated exposure to humans (topical application on 200 cm2 shaved skin:</seg>
<seg id="2713">In an embryotoxicity study of rats at oral dosages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day (according to ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure (see above)), development toxicity (reduced body weight of the fetus and delayed ossification) and maternal toxicity determined.</seg>
<seg id="2714">The owner of the marketing authorization must ensure that a pharmacovigilance system, as presented in the Module 1.8.1 of the application (version 6.2) is present and works before the product is marketed and as long as the marketed product is applied.</seg>
<seg id="2715">The owner of the marketing authorization is obliged to carry out detailed studies and additional pharmaceutical vigilance activities in the pharmacovigilance plan, as described in version 1 of the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and all additional updates of the RMP agreed with the CHMP.</seg>
<seg id="2716">As described in the CHMP "Guideline on Risk Management Systems for medicinal use," the updated RMP is to be submitted simultaneously with the next Periodic Safety Update Report.</seg>
<seg id="2717">Irritation or other signs and symptoms at the treated point indicate that you should quit the application of Altargo and talk to your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2718">Do not apply other ointments, creams or lotions on the surface treated with Altargo if it is not expressly prescribed by your doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2719">It must not be used in the eyes, in the mouth or on the lips, in the nose or in the female genital area.</seg>
<seg id="2720">If the ointment disappears from view on one of these surfaces, wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if complaints occur.</seg>
<seg id="2721">After applying the ointment, cover the affected area with a sterile dressing or a gazebo, unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the surface.</seg>
<seg id="2722">It is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cap that contains 5, 10 or 15 grams of ointment, or in an aluminium bag containing 0.5 g of ointment.</seg>
<seg id="2723">Ambichelia is used to treat hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between one and 15 years, which are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">Ambichelonia is used as part of a two-dose vaccination plan, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered.</seg>
<seg id="2725">For this reason, AmbiHendrix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and it is ensured that the two doses of the vaccination plan can be brought to an end.</seg>
<seg id="2726">If a refresher dose against hepatitis A or B is desired, Ambirix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine may be given.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"" "vaccines act by" "" "contributing" "" "to the immune system (the natural defences of the body) as it can defend itself against a disease." ""</seg>
<seg id="2728">"" "after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system recognises the viruses and surface antigens as" "" "alien" "" "and creates antibodies against it." ""</seg>
<seg id="2729">AmbiHendrix contains the same ingredients as the vaccine approved since 1996, the Twinrix adults and the vaccination that has been approved since 1997, the Twinrix children.</seg>
<seg id="2730">The three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix are given children as part of a three-dose vaccination plan.</seg>
<seg id="2731">Because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that supports the application of Twinrix adults were also used as a cover for the application of Ambirix.</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of effectiveness was the share of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">In an additional study of 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month and a 12-month interval between the two injections.</seg>
<seg id="2734">At between 98 and 100% of the vaccinated children, Ambigrad led a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambience's degree of protection was similar to a six-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">The most common side effects of Ambigrad (observed in more than 1 of 10 Vaccine doses) are headache, lack of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, matchiness (fatigue) as well as irritability.</seg>
<seg id="2737">Ambigrad may not be used in patients who are possibly hypersensitive (allergic) to the active ingredients, one of the other components or neomycin (an antibiotic).</seg>
<seg id="2738">In August 2002, the European Commission granted GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals to the company GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals.</seg>
<seg id="2739">The standard vaccination plan with Ambidiligence is composed of two doses, with the first dose being given at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose.</seg>
<seg id="2740">If a booster is requested both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B, vaccines or combination vaccine can be vaccinated with the corresponding monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2741">The anti-hepatitis B surface antigen (anti-HBsAg) and anti-hepatitis A virus (anti-HAV) antibodies originating from the combination vaccine are in the same magnitude as after vaccination with the respective monovalent vaccines.</seg>
<seg id="2742">It is not yet fully assured, whether immunocompetent individuals who have responded to a hepatitis A vaccine will need a booster-booster as protection, as they may be protected by immunological memory even in case of no longer detectable antibodies.</seg>
<seg id="2743">3 As with all injection vaccines, appropriate methods of medical treatment and monitoring should always be immediately available for the rare case of an anaphylactic reaction after the vaccine has been donated.</seg>
<seg id="2744">If a faster protection against hepatitis B is required, the standardisation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine, which contains 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2745">In hemodialysis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system, no adequate anti-HAV- and anti-HBs antibody levels may be reached after the priming, so that in these cases the gift of other inoculations may be required.</seg>
<seg id="2746">Since an intradermal injection or intramuscular administration could lead to an optimal result in the gluteal muscle, these injections should be avoided.</seg>
<seg id="2747">In the case of thrombocytopenia or blood clots, it can be injected subcutanically, as in these cases it can occur after intramuscular administration of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2748">If AmbiHendrix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined diphtheria, tetanus, azellular pertussi, inactivated poliomyelitis, and haemophilus influenza type b vaccine, the immune response to all antigens was sufficient (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="2749">In patients with immunosuppressive therapy or in patients with immune defects it must be assumed that no adequate immune response may be achieved.</seg>
<seg id="2750">In a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults, the frequency of pain, redness, swelling, matchiness, gastroenteritis, headaches and fever is similar to the frequency observed in the earlier thian salt and preservative-containing vaccine formulation.</seg>
<seg id="2751">In clinical trials, 2029 vaccines have been given to a total of 1027 vaccines at the age of 1 to and including 15 years.</seg>
<seg id="2752">In a study involving 300 participants aged 12 to and including 15 years, the compatibility of Ambience was compared with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2753">The only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and quality on a basis of the calculation per inoculation dose, but not on a basis of calculation per person.</seg>
<seg id="2754">Pain was observed in 50,7% of the subjects after the gift of Ambienta, compared to 39.1% in subjects after the administration of a dose of the 3-doses combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2755">After the complete inoculation cycle, 66.4% of the subjects who had been given Ambimania reported pain, compared to 63.8% for the subjects who had been vaccinated with the 3-dose combination vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2756">However, the frequency of maturality was comparable to pro gangs (i.e., across the entire vaccination cycle at 39.6% of subjects who got Ambigrad, compared to 36.2% among the subjects receiving the 3-doses combination vaccine).</seg>
<seg id="2757">The frequency of pronounced pain and quality was low and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3-dose vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2758">In a comparative study of 1 to 11-year-old vaccinations, the occurrence of local reactions and general reactions in the AmbirixGroup was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3-doses combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2759">However, a frequent occurrence of pain (at the injection point) per dose, not per tape, was reported in the 6- to 11-year-olds.</seg>
<seg id="2760">The proportion of vaccines that reported serious side effects during the 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambigrad or during the 3-doses vaccine with the combination vaccine with 360 ELISA- units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen was not statistically different.</seg>
<seg id="2761">In clinical trials conducted at the age of 1 to and including 15 years, the Seroconversions for anti-HAV were 99.1% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2762">Anti-HBs' seroconvergence rates were 74.2% a month after the first dose and 100% a month after the second dose which was administered for the month 6 (i.e. in month 7).</seg>
<seg id="2763">7 In a comparative study, conducted at 12- and including 15-year-olds, 142 two cans Ambigrad and 147 were awarded the standard combination vaccine with three doses.</seg>
<seg id="2764">In the 289 persons whose immunogenicity was worthless, the rate of serum was significantly higher compared with Ambienta (SP in the table below) versus hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the administration of the three-dose vaccine.</seg>
<seg id="2765">The immune responses that were achieved in a clinical comparative study at 1-11-year-olds a month after the end of full inoculation series (i.e. in month 7) are listed in the following table.</seg>
<seg id="2766">Both studies received either a 2-dose vaccination scheme with Ambigrad or a 3-dose vaccination scheme with a combination vaccine containing 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen.</seg>
<seg id="2767">The persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies was detected in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at least 24 months after the immunization with Ambidiligence in the 0-6 month vaccination scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2768">The immune response observed in this study against both antigens was comparable to that detected after vaccination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of formalininactivated Hepatic A-Virus and 10 µg recombinant hepatitis B surface antigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml.</seg>
<seg id="2769">In a clinical study at 12- to including 15-year-olds it could be shown that the persistence of anti-HAVs and anti-HBs antibodies is comparable 24 months after immunization in the 0-6 months-vaccination scheme.</seg>

<seg id="2779">As with all vaccines, Ambirix can not fully protect itself from an infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus, even if the complete vaccine has been concluded with 2 doses.</seg>
<seg id="2780">If you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before the two Vaccines have been administered (although you / your child is not yet unhappy or sick at the time of the vaccination), vaccination may not prevent a disease.</seg>
<seg id="2781">A protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those of hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection cannot be mediated.</seg>

<seg id="2785">In the case of a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vaccination, the physician will advise you / your child of a vaccination with Ambidiligence.</seg>
<seg id="2786">Instead, he / her child will recommend 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective ingredients per inoculation dose (360 ELISA units of a formalininactivated hepatitis A virus and 10 micrograms of a recombinant hepatitis B surface).</seg>
<seg id="2787">The second inoculation dose of this vaccine with reduced content of effective ingredients is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccination protection against end of the vaccine series.</seg>

<seg id="2806">However, since ambition was brought into circulation only in one Member State (in the Netherlands since May 2003), the available safety data for this drug is limited due to the low patient exposure.</seg>
<seg id="2807">Ammonary can also be used in patients with incomplete enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">- split into several single doses at meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomy hose (through the abdominal wall into the stomach leading tube) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach leading tube).</seg>

<seg id="2812">"" "under" "" "exceptional circumstances" "", "Ammontaps was approved because limited information was given to this drug at the time of approval." ""</seg>
<seg id="2813">The use is indicated in all patients, where a complete lack of enzymatic deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 days of life).</seg>
<seg id="2814">In patients with a late manifest form (incomplete enzyme defect that manifests after the first months of life) there is an indication for the use, if in the anamnesis a hyperammonia encephalopathy arises.</seg>
<seg id="2815">For infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swallowing disorders AMMONAPS is also available in granule form.</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually, taking into account protein tolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniethyl phosphate.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with arginine-uccinate synthetase deficiency should receive arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcers if the tablets do not reach the stomach immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2821">Each dose of AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2822">Therefore, AMMONAPS should be used only with care in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency as well as with sodium retention and deformation.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Since the metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrate over the liver and kidneys occurs, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme care in patients with liver or kidney failure.</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">In subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high dosage (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons.</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and reduced number of functioning nerve endings in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">It could not be determined whether phenylacetate is excreted into breast milk in humans, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2828">In clinical trials with AMMONAPS at least one adverse event (AE) occurred in 56% of patients and 78% of these adverse events were assumed to not be associated with AMMONAPS.</seg>
<seg id="2829">The frequency is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1 / 10), frequently (≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 10) and occasionally (≥ 1 / 1000, &lt; 1 / 100).</seg>
<seg id="2830">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in connection with lactate cell, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosage occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phenylacetate, which showed dose-limiting neurotoxicity in an intravenous dosage of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is an metabolisch active compound, which is jugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine, which is excreted through the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 Patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that a sodium phenylbutyrate of 0.12 and 0.15 g of phenylacetylacetylglutamine nitrogen is produced for each gram.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is started right away in order to improve survival and clinical results.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust, and the disease itself led to death in the first year of life with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues.</seg>
<seg id="2838">By means of hemodialysis, the use of alternative ways of excretion of nitrogen (sodium phenylbutyrate, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartum (but within the first life month) to 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2839">Patients whose disease was diagnosed during pregnancy and who were already treated before the first occurrence of hyperammonia encephalopathy were the survival rate of 100%, but even in these patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits.</seg>
<seg id="2840">In patients with a late manifest form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the orniethyl-scarcylase deficiency), who recovered from a hyperammonia encephalopathy and subsequently treated with sodium phenylbutyrate and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%.</seg>
<seg id="2841">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">Phenylbutyrate is known to be oxidized to phenylacetate, which is enzymatic with glutamine in the liver and kidney, with phenylacetylglutamine produced.</seg>
<seg id="2843">The concentrations of phenylbutyrate and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in a sober healthy adult and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, hemoglobin metabolism and liver cirrhosis of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled studies).</seg>
<seg id="2844">Phenylbutyrate and metabolites were also studied in patients with intravenous sodium phenylbutyrate (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in tablet form, measured plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were found 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2846">In the majority of patients with urea-cycle disturbances or hemoglobinopathies, phenylbutyrate (300-650 mg / kg / day to 20 g / day) was not detectable in plasma the next morning after night fasting.</seg>
<seg id="2847">In three out of six patients with liver cirrhosis, which were repeatedly treated with sodium phenylbutyrate (20 g / day orally in three single doses), the average phenylacetate concentrations in plasma levels were five times higher than after the first gifts.</seg>
<seg id="2848">The medication is excreted within 24 hours to about 80-100% in the form of the conjugated product phenylacetylglutamine over the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2849">According to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrate had no complaining effects in the rats treated with toxic and non-toxic cans (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2850">AMMONAPS granulate is taken either orally (babies and children who still do not swallow the tablets, or patients with swallowing disorders) or via a gas stomatitis or a nasal probe.</seg>
<seg id="2851">According to the previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrate is: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in newborns, infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.9 - 13.0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults.</seg>
<seg id="2852">The concentration of ammonia, arginine, essential amino acids (in particular branched-chain amino acids), carnitine and serum proteins should be kept within the normal range.</seg>
<seg id="2853">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of carbamylphosphate synthetase or orniethyl phosphate.</seg>
<seg id="2854">AMMONAPS granulate contains 124 mg (5,4 mmol) sodium per gram of sodium phenylbutyrate, equivalent to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrate, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose.</seg>
<seg id="2855">If rat-flutes were exposed before the birth Phenylacetate (active metabolite of phenylbutyrat), it came to lesions in the pyramid cells of the cerebral cortex.</seg>
<seg id="2856">A probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by an 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed a metabolic Encephalopathy in connection with lactate cell, severe hypokalemia, pancytopenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis.</seg>
<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine is comparable to urea (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of surplus</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on the excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, it is assumed that for each gram of biased sodium phenylbutyrate between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylacetylglutamine nitrogen is produced.</seg>
<seg id="2859">Existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible, and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition may occur.</seg>
<seg id="2860">After an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrate in granule form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrate were found 15 minutes after ingestion.</seg>
<seg id="2861">During the durability, the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C.</seg>
<seg id="2862">In this procedure, the small measuring spoon is 0.95 g, the average measuring spoon 2,9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.6 g sodium phenylbutyrate.</seg>
<seg id="2863">If a patient has to receive the medicine using a probe, AMMONAPS can also be dissolved in water before use (the solubility of sodium phenylbutyrate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water).</seg>
<seg id="2864">In patients with these rare diseases, certain liver enzymes are missing so that they cannot excrete the nitrogen-containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins.</seg>

<seg id="2879">Angiox is used to treat adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS, reduced blood supply to the heart), for example in unstable Angina (a form of chest pain with different thicknesses) or myocardial infarction (heart attack) without "stopping" (an anomalous measurement value in electrocardiogram or ECG).</seg>
<seg id="2880">If Angiox is used to prevent blood clots in patients who undergo a PCI, a higher dose is administered and the infusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure.</seg>
<seg id="2881">This can help in patients with angina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2882">Approximately 14,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of ACS, in which the effect of angiox in sole administration or in combination with a glycoprotein IIb / IIIa inhibitor (GPI, another drug for preventing blood clots) was compared with the conventional combination treatment with heparin (another anticoagulant) and a GPI.</seg>
<seg id="2883">During the PCI, patients often used a stent (a short tube remaining in the artery to prevent closure), and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood clots, such as abciximab and aspirin.</seg>
<seg id="2884">In the treatment of ACS, Angiox - with or without the administration of GPI - was as effective as conventional treatment in the prevention of new events (death cases, heart attacks or revascularization) after 30 days or a year.</seg>
<seg id="2885">In patients undergoing a PCI, Angiox was just as effective in all indicators as Heparin, except for heavy bleeding where it was significantly more effective than heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2886">Angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other hirudine or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="2887">It must also not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, and in people with severe high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="2888">The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that Angiox is an acceptable replacement for Heparin during the treatment of ACS and during one PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2889">In September 2004, the European Commission issued approval to The Medicines Company UK Ltd to approve Angiox in the entire European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2890">For the treatment of adult patients with acute coronary syndrome (unstable Angina / non-ST-Hebungsinfarkt (IA / NSTEMI) in case of an emergency call or if an early intervention is foreseen.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The recommended initial dose of Angiox in patients with ACS is an intravenous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2892">If a PCI is carried out in another follow-up, an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1.75 mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2893">According to the PCI, the reduced infusion dose can be resumed from 0.25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements.</seg>
<seg id="2894">An indication of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered immediately before the procedure, followed by an infusion of 1.75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation.</seg>
<seg id="2895">The recommended dosage of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a single captive bolt of angiox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">If this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt input of 0.3 mg / kg / bodyweight should take place.</seg>
<seg id="2898">In order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT levels, the reconstituted and diluted medicinal product should be carefully mixed prior to use and the captive bolt dose should be administered quickly intravenously.</seg>
<seg id="2899">Once the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1,75 mg / kg infusion dose is administered correctly.</seg>
<seg id="2900">In patients with moderate kidney function (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether with a bivalirudin against ACS), a lower infusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used.</seg>
<seg id="2901">If the ACT value lies below 225 seconds, a second dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose of the bolt will be reviewed again.</seg>
<seg id="2902">In patients with moderate kidney damage, included in the Phase III- PCI study (REPLACE-2), which resulted in approval, the ACT value was 5 minutes after offering the bivalirudin-bolus without dose adjustment at an average of 366 ± 89 seconds.</seg>
<seg id="2903">3 In case of patients with severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients Angiox is contraindicated (see section 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2904">The treatment with Angiox can be initiated 30 minutes after the IV administration of fractionated heparin or 8 hours after completion of subcutaneous administration of low molecular heparin.</seg>
<seg id="2905">• known hypersensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against hirudine • active bleeding or increased bleeding risk due to malfunctioning of the hemostasis system and / or irreversible bacterial endocarditis. • severe kidney damage (GFR &lt; 30 ml / min) and in dialysis patients</seg>
<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during the treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding, especially if bivalirudin is given in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">Even if the majority of hemorrhages occur at the arterial points of the arterial occlusion in PCI patients, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) can, in principle, occur bleeding all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="2908">In patients who are taken Warfarin and treated with a bivalirudin, a monitoring of the INR value (International Regular Ratio) should be taken into consideration in order to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with bivalirudin again reaches the level of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2909">Starting from the knowledge of the mechanism of action of anticoagulants (heparin, warfarin, thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregators), it can be assumed that these agents increase the risk of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2910">In the combination of bivalirudin with thrombocyte aggregators or anticoagulants, the clinical and biological haemostasis parameters are regularly monitored.</seg>

<seg id="2912">4612 were randomised to bio-valirudin alone, 4604 were randomized to bivalirudin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and 4603 were randomized to either unfractionated heparin or Enoxaparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2913">Both in the bivalirudin group as well as in the comparison groups treated with Heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2914">Severe bleeding has been defined in accordance with the ACUITY and Timi standards for heavy bleeding like in table 2 footnotes.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Both light and heavy bleedings were significantly less frequent among Bivalirudin than in the groups with Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor and bio-IIb / III- inhibitor (see table 2).</seg>
<seg id="2916">An ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following: intraarterial, retroperitoneal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the insertion zone, which requires a radiological or surgical intervention, reduction of the hemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood station, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2917">Other, less frequently observed blood localisations occuring at more than 0.1% (occasionally) were "other" spots, retroperitoneal, gastrointestinal, ear, nose, or throat.</seg>
<seg id="2918">The following information on adverse events is based on data from a clinical trial with bivalirudin in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2919">Both in the bivalirudin group as well as in the comparison groups treated with Heparin were more common in women as well as in patients over 65 years of age than in male or younger patients.</seg>
<seg id="2920">Both light and heavy haemorrhages were significantly less frequent among Bivalirudin than in the comparative group under Heparin plus GPIIb / IIIa inhibitor.</seg>
<seg id="2921">The following side effects listed above have been reported in practice after comprehensive application and are grouped in table 6 according to system organ classes.</seg>
<seg id="2922">In the case of overdosage, the treatment with bivalirudin is immediately aborted and the patient is closely monitored with regard to signs of bleeding.</seg>
<seg id="2923">Angiox contains bivalirudin, a direct and specific thromboinhibitor, which binds both at the catalytic center and the anion-binding region of Thrombin regardless of whether Thrombin is bound in the liquid phase or in the clots.</seg>
<seg id="2924">The binding of the bivalirudin to thromboin, and with it its effect, is reversible, because Thrombine slowly splits the binding of Bivalirudin-ARG3-Pro4, thereby regenerating the function of the active centre of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2925">In addition, a bivalirudin with serum from patients with which in the past had come to heparasitic thrombocytopenia / heparininducized thrombosis syndrome (HIT / HITTS) did not induce a platelet aggregation reaction.</seg>
<seg id="2926">In healthy volunteers and in patients, Bivalirudin shows a dose of dose and concentration-dependent anticoagulation, which is evidenced by the prolongation of ACT, aPTT, PT, INR and TT.</seg>
<seg id="2927">If a PCI was carried out below, an additional bolt of 0.5mg / kg of bivalirudin should be given and the infusion for the duration of the intervention should be increased to 1,75mg / kg / h.</seg>
<seg id="2928">In arm A of the ACUITY study, unfractionated heparin or enoxaparin was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients with unstable Angina / non-ST-Hebungsinfarction (IA / NSTEMI).</seg>
<seg id="2929">Patients in Arm A and B were also randomized to obtain a GPIb / IIIa inhibitor prior to the start of angiography (at the time of randomisation) or the PCI.</seg>
<seg id="2930">In the ACUITY study, the characteristics of high-risk patients who required angiography in 72 hours were spread evenly across the 3 treatment arms.</seg>
<seg id="2931">About 77% of patients had recurrent ischemia, 70% had dynamic EKG- changes or increased cardiac biomarkers, 28% had diabetes and about 99% of all patients submitted within 72 hours of angiography.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Primary analysis and results from the ACUITY study for the 30 day and 1 year endpoint for the overall population (ITT) and for patients receiving Aspirin and Clopidogrel according to protocol (before angiography or before the PCI) are presented in tables 7 and 8.</seg>

<seg id="2937">* Clopidogrel before angiography or before PCI 1 A ACUITY heavy bleeding was defined as one of the following: intraarterial, retroperito-neal, intraocular hemorrhage or bleeding in the point of refraction, reduction of hemoglobin level ≥ 3 g / dl with known blood station, reoperation due to bleeding, application of blood products for transfusion.</seg>
<seg id="2938">The 30-day results, based on quadruple and triple endpoints of a randomised double blind study with more than 6,000 patients (REPLACE-2), are shown in table 10.</seg>
<seg id="2939">Clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angiox in patients with HIT / HITTS.</seg>
<seg id="2940">The pharmacokinetic characteristics of bivalirudin were evaluated in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and in patients with ACS.</seg>
<seg id="2941">It is expected that, as a peptide, a peptide contains a catabolism in its amino acid components followed by recycling of amino acids in the body pool.</seg>
<seg id="2942">The primary metabolite resulting from the split of the ARG3-Pro4 binding of the N-terminal sequence by Thrombin is not effective because of the loss of its affinity to the catalytic center of thrombin.</seg>
<seg id="2943">The elimination occurs in patients with normal kidney function after a first order process with a terminally half-life of 25 ± 12 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="2944">Based on conventional studies on safety disease, toxicity in repeated application, genotoxicity or reproduction toxicity, preclinical data does not reveal any particular dangers for humans.</seg>
<seg id="2945">Toxicity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure (1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10-times of the clinical Steady-state plasma concentration) was limited to superior pharmacological effects.</seg>
<seg id="2946">Side effects due to longer-term physiological loading as a reaction to non-homologous coagulation were not observed after short-term exposure to those in clinical use, even at very much higher dosage.</seg>

<seg id="2965">Apidra is used to treat adults, adolescents and children from the age of six with diabetes who require a treatment with insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2966">Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thigh or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump.</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate glucose levels (sugar) in the blood or cannot handle insulin effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin secreisine is very slightly different from human insulin, and the change means that it acts faster and has a shorter time of action than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">Apidra was studied in the application in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 572 children aged between four and 17 years.</seg>
<seg id="2970">Type 2 diabetes, where the body cannot effectively rework insulin, Apidra has been studied in a study of 878 adults.</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how good the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes, a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) compared to a decrease of 0.14% in insulin delivery was observed after six months.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes, the lowering of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin injectins or any of the other components, or in patients who already suffer from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which may affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">In September 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH to approve Apidra's placing in the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="2977">Apidra can be used as subcutaneous injection either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thigh or the delta muscle or subcutaneous by continuous infusion in the abdomen area.</seg>
<seg id="2978">Because of reduced glucose levels and reduced insulin metabolism, insulin needs in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced.</seg>
<seg id="2979">Any change of activity, brand (heart rate), insulin type (normal, NPH, zinc-retarded etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in the insulin demand.</seg>
<seg id="2980">3. inadequate dosage or abortion of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, may cause hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life threatening.</seg>
<seg id="2981">Changing a patient to another type of insulin or an insulin from another manufacturer should be carried out under strict medical supervision and may require a change of dosage.</seg>
<seg id="2982">The timing of hypoglycemia depends on the active profile of the used insulin and can therefore change when the treatment scheme is changed.</seg>
<seg id="2983">These include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-contentting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, disopypyramid, fibrate, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase, propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide-antibiotics.</seg>
<seg id="2984">In addition, the symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation can be underestimated under the effects of sympathetic agents such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and reserpine.</seg>
<seg id="2985">Animal experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisine and humaninsulin in relation to pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2986">It is not known whether insulin secretion occurs in human breast milk but insulin is not absorbed in breast milk nor is absorbed after oral use.</seg>
<seg id="2987">Listed below are the adverse drug interactions known from clinical trials (≥ 1 / 10; often: ≥ 1 / 100; &lt; 1 / 100; occasionally: ≥ 1 / 100; &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 10; very rare: ≥ 1 / 100; very rare: ≥ 1 / 100; not known (frequency based on available data is not predictable).</seg>
<seg id="2988">Cold welding, cool and pale skin, tiredness, nervousness or tremors, anxiety, unusual exhaustion or weakness, confusion, lack of concentration, drowsiness, excessive dog, changes in vision, headache, nausea, and palpitations.</seg>
<seg id="2989">Lipodystrophy If the injection unit changes continuously within the injection area, a lipodystrophy can occur at the injection site.</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycemics with unconsciousness can be treated by an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1 mg) given by a correspondingly trained person, or by intravenous administration of glucose by a physician.</seg>
<seg id="2991">After gluing, the patient should be monitored in a hospital in order to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes.</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose absorption (especially through skeletal muscles and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in subcutaneous GA- be of insulin-lulisin the effect occurs faster and the duration of action is shorter than with hug normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">In a study of 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin lulisin showed a dose of proportional gluing effect in the therapeutically relevant dosage range of 0.075 to 0.15 E / kg, as well as a disproportionate increase in the glucosal effect, just like humaninsulin.</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin secretion has a twice as rapid response as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect about 2 hours earlier than a human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">From the data it was obvious that at an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable post-prandial glycemic control is achieved, as with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2997">If insulin lulisin was dug in 2 minutes before the meal, a better post-prandial control was achieved than with human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal.</seg>
<seg id="2998">If insulin discharges in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycemic control is achieved, as with human normal insulin, which is given 2 million nudes before the meal (see Figure 1).</seg>
<seg id="2999">Insulin lulisin in gift 2 minutes (GLULISIN - before) before the start of the meal compared to human normal insulin, which was given 30 minutes (NORMAL - 30 min) before the meal began (figure 1A) as well as compared to human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before a meal (Figure 1B).</seg>
<seg id="3000">Insulin Lulisin for 15 minutes (GLULISIN - afterwards) after the start of the meal compared to the human standard insulin, which was given 2 minutes (NORMAL - before) before the start of the meal (Figure 1C).</seg>
